# Medical to Layman Translator (Inference)
This project provides tools to translate complex medical jargon into plain, easy-to-understand language ("Layman terms"). It utilizes a fine-tuned **FLAN-T5** model to perform text simplification, specifically targeting clinical and regulatory use cases.

## Setup & Installation
Choose one of the methods below to set up your environment.

### Option A: Using Conda (Recommended)
Best for managing complex dependencies and GPU libraries.

```powershell
# 1. Create the environment
conda create -n nlp-env python=3.10 -y

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate nlp-env

# 3. Install Core Libraries (PyTorch, Transformers, Accelerate)
conda install -c conda-forge pytorch transformers accelerate sentencepiece -y

# 4. Install UI Library
pip install streamlit watchdog

```

### Option B: Using Standard Python (Pip)
Use this if you do not have Anaconda installed.

```powershell
# 1. Create a virtual environment (PowerShell)
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3. Install all dependencies
pip install torch transformers accelerate sentencepiece streamlit watchdog

```

> **Note for Pip Users:** If you have a dedicated NVIDIA GPU and want to ensure PyTorch uses it, you may need to install the specific CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch before running the command above. Visit [pytorch.org/get-started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the exact command.

## Usage
Make sure your conda environment is active (`conda activate nlp-env`) before running any scripts.

### 1. Clinical Trial Summarizer (Main App)
This application is designed for Medical Writers. It provides a split-view interface to draft "Plain Language Summaries" for clinical protocols (e.g., Study Designs, Inclusion Criteria).

```powershell
streamlit run clinical_trial_example.py

```

### 2. Simple Translator UI
A lightweight interface for general medical text simplification.

```powershell
streamlit run Simple_ui.py

```

### 3. Command Line Test
Quickly test if the model loads and runs inference without opening a web browser.

```powershell
python Example_testing.py

```

## Model Details
The model located in `flan_t5_base_lora_merged` consists of:

* **LoRA Adapter Weights (Stage 2):** Lightweight fine-tuned parameters specifically trained for medical text simplification.
* **Configuration Files:** JSON configs defining the model architecture and generation parameters.

*Note: This folder relies on the base FLAN-T5 architecture. Ensure your internet connection is active during the first run if the base model needs to be cached by the Transformers library.*
