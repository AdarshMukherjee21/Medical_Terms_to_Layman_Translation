  "medical": "CC: BLE weakness. HX: This 82y/o RHM was referred to the Neurology service by the Neurosurgery service for evaluation of acute onset paraplegia. He was in his usual state of health until 5:30PM on 4/6/95, when he developed sudden &quot;pressure-like&quot; epigastric discomfort associated with bilateral lower extremity weakness, SOB, lightheadedness and diaphoresis. He knelt down to the floor and &quot;went to sleep.&quot; The Emergency Medical Service was alert and arrived within minutes, at which time he was easily aroused though unable to move or feel his lower extremities. No associated upper extremity or bulbar dysfunction was noted. He was taken to a local hospital where an INR was found to be 9.1. He was given vitamin K 15mg, and transferred to UIHC to rule out spinal epidural hemorrhage. An MRI scan of the T-spine was obtained and the preliminary reading was &quot;normal.&quot; The Neurology service was then asked to evaluate the patient. MEDS: Coumadin 2mg qd, Digoxin 0.25mg qd, Prazosin 2mg qd. PMH: 1)HTN. 2)A-Fib on coumadin. 3)Peripheral vascular disease:s/p left Femoral-popliteal bypass (8/94) and graft thrombosis-thrombolisis (9/94). 4)Adenocarcinoma of the prostate: s/p TURP (1992). FHX: unremarkable. SHX: Farmer, Married, no Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP165/60 HR86 RR18 34.2C SAO2 98% on room air. MS: A&O to person, place, time. In no acute distress. Lucid. CN: unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength in BUE. Flaccid paraplegia in BLE Sensory: T6 sensory level to LT/PP, bilaterally. Decreased vibratory sense in BLE in a stocking distribution, distally. Coord: Intact FNF and RAM in BUE. Unable to do HKS. Station: no pronator drift. Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE, Absent in BLE, plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Rectal: decreased rectal tone. GEN EXAM: No carotid bruitts. Lungs: bibasilar crackles. CV: Irregular rate and rhythm with soft diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdomen: flat, soft, non-tender without bruitt or pulsatile mass. Distal pulses were strong in all extremities. COURSE: Hgb 12.6, Hct 40%, WBC 11.7, Plt 154k, INR 7.6, PTT 50, CK 41, the GS was normal. EKG showed A-Fib at 75BPM with competing junctional pacemaker, essentially unchanged from 9/12/94. It was suspected that the patient sustained an anterior-cervico-thoracic spinal cord infarction with resultant paraplegia and T6 sensory level. A CXR was done in the ER prior to admission. This revealed cardiomegaly and a widened mediastinum. He returned from the x-ray suite and suddenly became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitative measures failed. Pericardiocentesis was unremarkable. Autopsy revealed a massive aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the origin of the iliac arteries with extensive pericardial hematoma. The dissection was seen in retrospect on the MRI T-spine.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: weakness in both legs.\n\nHistory: An 82‑year‑old man was sent from neurosurgery to neurology because he suddenly became paralyzed in his legs. He was fine until 5:30 p.m. on April 6, 1995, when he felt a sudden “pressure‑like” pain in his upper belly and had weakness in both legs, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and sweating. He knelt down and fell asleep. Emergency medical services arrived quickly. He could be awakened but could not move or feel his legs. His arms were fine. He was taken to a local hospital where his blood clotting test (INR) was 9.1. He received 15 mg of vitamin K and was sent to UIHC to rule out bleeding around the spinal cord. An MRI of the thoracic spine was done and initially read as normal. Neurology was then asked to see him.\n\nMedications: Coumadin 2 mg daily, Digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Prazosin 2 mg daily.\n\nPast medical history: high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, peripheral vascular disease (left femoral‑popliteal bypass in 1994 and graft clot treated in 1994), prostate cancer treated with TURP in 1992. Family history: none notable. Social history: farmer, married, no tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.\n\nPhysical exam: Blood pressure 165/60, heart rate 86, breathing 18, temperature 34.2 °C, oxygen 98 % on room air. He was alert and oriented, not in distress, clear. Cranial nerves normal. Muscle strength 5/5 in both arms. Legs were flaccid and weak. Sensation was lost below the T6 level on both sides. Vibrations were decreased in a stocking‑like pattern in the legs. Coordination in the arms was normal; he could not do heel‑to‑toe. Reflexes 2/2 in arms, absent in legs; plantar reflexes flexor. Rectal tone decreased. No carotid bruits. Lungs had crackles at the bases. Heart had irregular rhythm and a soft diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdomen flat, soft, no tenderness, no bruits or masses. Distal pulses strong in all limbs.\n\nCourse: Blood tests: hemoglobin 12.6, hematocrit 40%, white cells 11.7, platelets 154 k, INR 7.6, PTT 50, CK 41. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 75 bpm with a competing junctional pacemaker, unchanged from 1994. Doctors thought he had a spinal cord stroke in the upper thoracic area causing paraplegia and a T6 sensory level. A chest X‑ray before admission showed an enlarged heart and a widened mediastinum. After the X‑ray, he suddenly became unresponsive and stopped breathing and heart stopped. CPR and other attempts failed. A fluid tap from the pericardium was normal. An autopsy found a huge aortic dissection from the aortic root to the start of the iliac arteries, with a large blood collection around the heart. The dissection could be seen on the earlier spinal MRI."
