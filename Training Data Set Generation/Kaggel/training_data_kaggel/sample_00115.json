  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. ANESTHESIA: General epidural ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 800 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: This is a 64-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the prostate confirmed by needle biopsies. He has elected to undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Potential complications include, but are not limited to: 1. Infection. 2. Bleeding. 3. Incontinence. 4. Impotence. 5. Deep venous thrombosis. 6. Recurrence of the cancer. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area. Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered. The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed. The rectus fascia was opened sharply. The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly. Bookwalter retractor was then placed. Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched. The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder. Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips. The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section. The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors. The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply. The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area. The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle. The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra was then identified and was dissected out. The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors. This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly. 2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later. The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected. The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides. The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply. No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time. The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily. Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely. The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected. The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles. Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen. The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact. It was sent for permanent section. The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels. The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck. Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck. A 20-French Foley Catheter was used. The anterior sutures were then placed. The Foley was then inflated. The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly. Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight. Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces. These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures. The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed. The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture. Skin was approximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the operation well.",

He chose to have a radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node removal. Possible problems from the surgery include infection, bleeding, loss of bladder control, loss of sexual function, blood clots in the legs, and cancer coming back.  \n\n**What happened during the operation:**  \n1. The anesthesiologist gave an epidural in the waiting area and the patient received a pre‑op antibiotic.  \n2. In the operating room the patient was put under general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask.  \n3. The surgeon shaved the lower abdomen, cleaned the area with Betadine, and inserted a 16‑French Foley catheter that drained clear urine.  \n4. A straight incision was made below the belly button. The abdominal muscle layer was cut open. The space around the bladder and the area behind the bladder were gently developed. A Bookwalter retractor was used.  \n5. The surgeon removed lymph nodes on both sides of the pelvis. The limits of the removal were the Cooper’s ligament, the inside edge of the external iliac artery, the split of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder. The surgeon used silk ties and hemostatic clips to stop bleeding. The lymph nodes were normal in feel and were sent for permanent pathology.  \n6. The retractor was moved and the pelvic fascia was opened on both sides with scissors. The puboprostatic ligament was cut sharply. The superficial dorsal vein over the prostate was clamped and tied with 2‑0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein was clamped and tied with a 0 Vicryl suture. The vein was then cut.  \n7. The urethra was identified and cut just below the tip of the prostate. The cut end was marked with 2‑0 Monocryl stitches for later reconnection. The catheter was removed, and the back part of the urethra and the rectourethral muscle were cut.  \n8. The outer pelvic fascia was opened on both sides to expose the nerve‑vascular bundles. The space between Denonvilliers’ fascia and the fat around the rectum was carefully developed. No tension was put on the nerve bundles. The prostate was freed from the rectum.  \n9. The seminal vesicles were found, their covering fascia was cut, and the vesicles were removed. Small blood vessels feeding them were clipped and cut.  \n10. The bladder neck was carefully dissected to preserve most of its muscle. The prostate was removed from the bladder neck all around. The bladder neck lining was cut to release the whole specimen. The specimen was intact and sent for permanent pathology.  \n11. The bladder neck lining was turned inside out and stitched with 4‑0 chromic sutures. The surgeon checked the prostate bed for bleeding. The stitches on the urethra were tied to the bladder neck. A 20‑French Foley catheter was inserted into the urethra and bladder neck, then inflated.  \n12. The front stitches were tied, then the back stitches, tightening the connection. Mild pulling on the catheter ensured a snug anastomosis. Two #19‑French Blake drains were placed in the spaces around the bladder and tied to the skin with 2‑0 silk sutures.  \n13. All instruments, sponges, and counts were verified. The fascia was closed in a running stitch with #1 PDS. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with metal clips.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the operation well."
