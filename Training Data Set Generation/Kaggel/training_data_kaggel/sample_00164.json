  "medical": "EXAM: Echocardiogram. INTERPRETATION: Echocardiogram was performed including 2-D and M-mode imaging, Doppler analysis continuous wave and pulse echo outflow velocity mapping was all seen in M-mode. Cardiac chamber dimensions, left atrial enlargement 4.4 cm. Left ventricle, right ventricle, and right atrium are grossly normal. LV wall thickness and wall motion appeared normal. LV ejection fraction is estimated at 65%. Aortic root and cardiac valves appeared normal. No evidence of pericardial effusion. No evidence of intracardiac mass or thrombus. Doppler analysis outflow velocity through the aortic valve normal, inflow velocities through the mitral valve are normal. There is mild tricuspid regurgitation. Calculated pulmonary systolic pressure 42 mmHg. ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC DIAGNOSES: 1. LV Ejection fraction, estimated at 65%. 2. Mild left atrial enlargement. 3. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. 4. Mildly elevated pulmonary systolic pressure.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Echocardiogram.  \nINTERPRETATION: The echo used 2‑D and M‑mode images, plus Doppler to measure blood flow. The heart chambers were measured: the left atrium is a little larger at 4.4 cm. The left ventricle, right ventricle, and right atrium look normal. The walls of the left ventricle are the right thickness and move normally. The left ventricle pumps about 65 % of the blood it holds (ejection fraction). The aortic root and heart valves look normal. There is no fluid around the heart, no masses or clots inside the heart. Blood flow through the aortic valve and the mitral valve is normal. There is a mild leak (regurgitation) from the tricuspid valve. The pressure in the lungs’ main artery (pulmonary systolic pressure) is a bit high at 42 mmHg.  \n\nECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC DIAGNOSES:  \n1. Left ventricle pumps 65 % of its blood (normal).  \n2. Mild enlargement of the left atrium.  \n3. Mild tricuspid valve leak.  \n4. Mildly high pressure in the pulmonary artery."
