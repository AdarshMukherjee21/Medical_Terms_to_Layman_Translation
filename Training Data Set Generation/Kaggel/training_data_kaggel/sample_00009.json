  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Elective male sterilization via bilateral vasectomy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fertile male with completed family. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fertile male with completed family. MEDICATIONS: Anesthesia is local with conscious sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. INDICATIONS: This 34-year-old gentleman has come to the office requesting sterilization via bilateral vasectomy. I discussed the indications and the need for procedure with the patient in detail, and he has given consent to proceed. He has been given prophylactic antibiotics. PROCEDURE NOTE: Once satisfactory sedation have been obtained, the patient was placed in the supine position on the operating table. Genitalia was shaved and then prepped with Betadine scrub and paint solution and were draped sterilely. The procedure itself was started by grasping the right vas deferens in the scrotum, and bringing it up to the level of the skin. The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath. The vas was brought out of the incision carefully. A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed. The free ends were cauterized and were tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves. After securing hemostasis with a cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized. Attention was now turned to the left side. The vas was grasped and brought up to the level of the skin. The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath. The vas was brought out of the incision carefully. A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed. The free ends were cauterized and tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves. After securing hemostasis with the cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized. Bacitracin ointment was applied as well as dry sterile dressing. The patient was awakened and was returned to Recovery in satisfactory condition.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** The patient had a planned vasectomy, which is a permanent birth‑control surgery for men.  \n\n**Before the surgery:** The man was healthy, had finished having children, and had agreed to the procedure. He was given antibiotics to prevent infection.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** Local anesthesia with light sedation was used so he could stay awake but not feel pain.  \n\n**During the surgery:**  \n1. The patient lay on his back on the operating table.  \n2. The area around the testicles was shaved, cleaned with a Betadine solution, and covered with sterile drapes.  \n3. The surgeon first worked on the right side. He lifted the right vas deferens (the tube that carries sperm) up to the skin, numbed the skin with 2% Xylocaine, and made a small cut to find the tube.  \n4. A 2‑inch piece of the tube was isolated and a 1‑inch section was removed. The two free ends were cauterized (burned to stop bleeding) and tied with 2‑0 silk sutures so the ends folded back on themselves. The area was cauterized again to stop bleeding, and the ends were let fall back into the incision, which was also cauterized.  \n5. The same steps were repeated on the left side.  \n6. After both sides were finished, bacitracin ointment was applied and a dry sterile dressing was put on.  \n\n**After the surgery:** The patient woke up and was sent to recovery in good condition. No complications or significant blood loss occurred."
