  "medical": "CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Generalized abdominal pain with swelling at the site of the ileostomy. TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300. CT ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. Punctate calcifications in the gallbladder lumen likely represent a gallstone. CT PELVIS: Postsurgical changes of a left lower quadrant ileostomy are again seen. There is no evidence for an obstruction. A partial colectomy and diverting ileostomy is seen within the right lower quadrant. The previously seen 3.4 cm subcutaneous fluid collection has resolved. Within the left lower quadrant, a 3.4 cm x 2.5 cm loculated fluid collection has not significantly changed. This is adjacent to the anastomosis site and a pelvic abscess cannot be excluded. No obstruction is seen. The appendix is not clearly visualized. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Resolution of the previously seen subcutaneous fluid collection. 2. Left pelvic 3.4 cm fluid collection has not significantly changed in size or appearance. These findings may be due to a pelvic abscess. 3. Right lower quadrant ileostomy has not significantly changed. 4. Cholelithiasis.",
  "layman": "CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was done because you have general abdominal pain and swelling near your ileostomy.  \n\n**Technique** – Images were taken while 100 mL of Isovue‑300 contrast was injected.  \n\n**Abdomen** – The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys look normal. A small calcium spot in the gallbladder probably is a gallstone.  \n\n**Pelvis** – The left lower‑quadrant ileostomy still looks the same as before. There is no blockage of the intestines. A partial removal of part of the colon and a diverting ileostomy are still present in the right lower quadrant. The fluid collection under the skin that was seen earlier has disappeared. In the left lower quadrant there is a 3.4 cm × 2.5 cm pocket of fluid that has not changed much; it is near the surgical connection and could be a pelvic abscess. No blockage is seen. The appendix is not clearly seen. The bladder looks normal.  \n\n**Impression**  \n1. The skin‑under‑the‑skin fluid collection is gone.  \n2. The 3.4 cm fluid pocket in the left pelvis is still about the same size and may be an abscess.  \n3. The right‑lower‑quadrant ileostomy is unchanged.  \n4. You have gallstones."
