  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Right sacral alar notch and sacroiliac joint/posterior rami radiofrequency thermocoagulation. ANESTHESIA: Local sedation. VITAL SIGNS: See nurse's notes. COMPLICATIONS: None. DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: INT was placed. The patient was in the operating room in the prone position. The back prepped with Betadine. The patient was given sedation and monitored. Under fluoroscopy, the right sacral alar notch was identified. After placement of a 20-gauge, 10 cm SMK needle into the notch, a positive sensory, negative motor stimulation was obtained. Following negative aspiration, 5 cc of 0.5% of Marcaine and 20 mg of Depo-Medrol were injected. Coagulation was then carried out at 90oC for 90 seconds. The SMK needle was then moved to the mid-inferior third of the right sacroiliac joint. Again the steps dictated above were repeated. The above was repeated for the posterior primary ramus branch right at S2 and S3 by stimulating along the superior lateral wall of the foramen; then followed by steroid injected and coagulation as above. There were no complications. The patient was returned to outpatient recovery in stable condition.",

The back was cleaned with Betadine. The patient received sedation and was monitored. Using X‑ray guidance, the right sacral notch was located. A 20‑gauge, 10‑cm needle was inserted into the notch. Sensory testing was positive and motor testing was negative, confirming the correct spot. After confirming no blood was drawn, 5 cc of 0.5 % Marcaine (a local anesthetic) and 20 mg of Depo‑Medrol (a steroid) were injected. The needle then delivered heat at 90 °C for 90 seconds to destroy the nerve tissue.  \n\nThe needle was moved to the lower third of the right sacroiliac joint. The same steps—testing, steroid injection, and heating—were repeated. The procedure was then performed on the main nerve branches at S2 and S3 by stimulating along the outer wall of the foramen, injecting steroid, and applying heat as before.  \n\nNo complications occurred. The patient was sent to the recovery area in stable condition."
