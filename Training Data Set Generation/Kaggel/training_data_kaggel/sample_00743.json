  "medical": "CC: Left hemiplegia. HX: A 58 y/o RHF awoke at 1:00AM on 10/23/92 with left hemiplegia and dysarthria which cleared within 15 minutes. She was seen at a local ER and neurological exam and CT Brain were reportedly unremarkable. She was admitted locally. She then had two more similar spells at 3AM and 11AM with resolution of the symptoms within an hour. She was placed on IV Heparin following the 3rd episode and was transferred to UIHC. She had not been taking ASA. PMH: 1)HTN. 2) Psoriasis. SHX: denied ETOH/Tobacco/illicit drug use. FHX: Unknown. MEDS: Heparin only. EXAM: BP160/90 HR145 (supine). BP105/35 HR128 (light headed, standing) RR12 T37.7C MS: Dysarthria only. Lucid thought process. CN: left lower facial weakness only. Motor: mild left hemiparesis with normal muscle bulk. Mildly increased left sided muscle tone. Sensory: unremarkable. Coordination: impaired secondary to weakness on left. Otherwise unremarkable. Station: left pronator drift. Romberg testing not done. Gait: not tested. Reflexes: symmetric; 2+ throughout. Gen Exam: CV: Tachycardic without murmur. COURSE: The patients signs and symptoms worsening during and after standing to check orthostatic blood pressures. She was immediately placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position and given IV fluids. Repeat neurologic exam at 5PM on the day of presentation revealed a return to the initial presentation of signs and symptoms. PT/PTT/GS/CBC/ABG were unremarkable. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with rate dependent junctional changes. CXR unremarkable. MRI Brain was obtained and showed an evolving right thalamic/lentiform nucleus infarction best illustrated by increased signal on the Proton density weighted images. Over the ensuing days of admission she had significant fluctuations of her BP (200mmHG to 140mmHG systolic). Her symptoms worsened with falls in BP. Her BP was initially controlled with esmolol or labetalol. Renal Ultrasound, abdominal/pelvic CT, renal function scan, serum and urine osmolality, urine catecholamines/metanephrine studies were unremarkable. Carotid doppler study revealed 0-15%BICA stenosis and antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. Cerebral angiogram was performed to r/o vasculitis. This revealed narrowing of the M1 segment of the right MCA. This was thought secondary to atherosclerosis and not vasculitis. She was discharged on ASA, Procardia XL, and Labetalol.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: paralysis on the left side of the body.  \nHistory: A 58‑year‑old woman from RHF woke up at 1:00 a.m. on October 23, 1992 with left‑side weakness and slurred speech. The symptoms disappeared after about 15 minutes. She went to a local emergency department where a neurological exam and a brain CT scan were normal. She was admitted to the local hospital. She had two more similar episodes at 3:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.; each time the symptoms went away within an hour. After the third episode she was started on IV heparin and transferred to UIHC. She had not been taking aspirin.\n\nPast medical history: high blood pressure and psoriasis.  \nSocial history: she says she does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illegal drugs.  \nFamily history: unknown.  \nMedications: only heparin.\n\nPhysical exam:  \n- When lying down her blood pressure was 160/90 and heart rate 145.  \n- When she stood up she felt light‑headed; her blood pressure dropped to 105/35 and heart rate 128.  \n- Breathing 12 breaths per minute, temperature 37.7 °C.  \n- Speech was slurred but her thoughts were clear.  \n- Mild weakness of the left side of her face.  \n- Mild weakness on the left side of her body, normal muscle size, slightly higher tone on the left.  \n- Sensation was normal.  \n- Coordination was impaired on the left because of the weakness.  \n- Left‑side pronator drift.  \n- Reflexes were normal and equal on both sides.  \n- Cardiovascular exam showed a fast heart rate but no heart murmur.\n\nCourse:  \nHer symptoms worsened when she stood up to check her blood pressure. She was put in a slightly tilted position and given IV fluids. A neurological exam at 5 p.m. that day showed the same problems she had at the start. Blood tests for clotting, electrolytes, blood count, and blood gases were normal. An ECG showed a fast heart rate with some rate‑dependent changes. A chest X‑ray was normal. An MRI of the brain showed a new stroke in the right thalamus and lentiform nucleus, best seen on proton‑density images. During the next few days her blood pressure varied a lot, from 200 mm Hg down to 140 mm Hg systolic. When her blood pressure fell, her symptoms got worse. She was treated with esmolol or labetalol to control her blood pressure. Tests of her kidneys, abdomen, and pelvis, kidney function, blood and urine osmolality, and urine catecholamines were all normal. A carotid ultrasound showed 0‑15 % narrowing of the internal carotid arteries and normal flow in the vertebral arteries on both sides. A heart ultrasound was normal. A cerebral angiogram was done to rule out vasculitis and showed narrowing of the M1 part of the right middle cerebral artery, which was thought to be due to atherosclerosis, not vasculitis. She was discharged on aspirin, Procardia XL, and labetalol."
