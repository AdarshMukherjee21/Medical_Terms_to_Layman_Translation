  "medical": "EXAM: Therapy intraarterial particulate administration. HISTORY: Hepatocellular carcinoma. TECHNIQUE: The patient was brought to the interventional radiology suite where catheterization of the right hepatic artery was performed. The patient had previously given oral and written consent to the radioembolization procedure. After confirmation of proper positioning of the hepatic artery catheter, 3.78 GBq of yttrium-90 TheraSphere microspheres were infused through the catheter under strict radiation safety procedures. FINDINGS: There were no apparent complications. Using data on tumor burden, right lobe liver volume, vascularity of the tumor obtained from angiography and quantitative CT, and measurement of residual activity tumor, the expected radiation dose to the tumor burden in the right lobe of the liver was calculated at 201 Gy. The expected dose to the remaining right liver parenchyma is 30 Gy. Following the procedure there was no evidence of radioactive contamination of the room, equipment or personnel. IMPRESSION: Radioembolization therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in the right lobe of the liver using 3.78 GBq of yttrium-90 microspheres TheraSphere.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Radioactive particle therapy delivered through a blood vessel.  \nHISTORY: Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).  \n\nTECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to the interventional radiology room. A catheter was inserted into the right hepatic artery. The patient had already signed consent for this radioembolization procedure. After the catheter was correctly positioned, 3.78 GBq of yttrium‑90 TheraSphere microspheres were injected through the catheter while following strict radiation safety rules.  \n\nFINDINGS: No complications were seen. Using information about the tumor size, the volume of the right lobe of the liver, how well the tumor is supplied with blood (from angiography and CT scans), and how much radioactivity remains in the tumor, the expected radiation dose to the tumor in the right lobe was calculated to be 201 Gy. The expected dose to the rest of the right liver tissue was 30 Gy. After the procedure, there was no evidence of radioactive contamination of the room, equipment, or staff.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Radioembolization of liver cancer in the right lobe using 3.78 GBq of yttrium‑90 TheraSphere microspheres."
