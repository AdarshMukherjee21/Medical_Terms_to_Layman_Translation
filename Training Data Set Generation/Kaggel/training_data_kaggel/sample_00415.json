  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right direct inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Right direct inguinal hernia repair with PHS mesh system. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. The Right groin and abdomen were prepped and draped in the standard sterile surgical fashion. An incision was made approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle and in a skin crease. Dissection was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Scarpa's fascia was divided, and the external ring was located. The external oblique was divided from the external ring up towards the anterior superior iliac spine. The cord structures were then encircled. Careful inspection of the cord structures did not reveal any indirect sac along the cord structures. I did, however, feel a direct sac with a direct defect. I opened the floor of the inguinal canal and dissected out the preperitoneal space at the direct sac and cut out the direct sac. Once I cleared out the preperitoneal space, I placed a PHS mesh system with a posterior mesh into the preperitoneal space, and I made sure that it laid flat along Cooper's ligament and covered the myopectineal orifice. I then tucked the extended portion of the anterior mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, and I then tacked the medial portion of the mesh to the pubic tubercle with a 0 Ethibond suture. I tacked the superior portion of the mesh to the internal oblique and the inferior portion of the mesh to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh in order to incorporate the cord structures and recreated the internal ring, making sure that it was not too tight so that it did not strangulate the cord structures. I then closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I closed the Scarpa's with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and I closed the skin with a running Monocril. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well and without any complications.",

General anesthesia was given and a breathing tube was placed. The right groin and abdomen were cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A small cut was made about one finger’s width above the pubic bone, in a natural skin crease. The surgeon cut through the skin and the fatty tissue underneath. The layer called Scarpa’s fascia was split, and the outer ring of the groin was found. The outer oblique muscle was cut from the outer ring up toward the front of the hip bone. The structures that run through the groin (the cord) were wrapped in a loop. No indirect hernia sac was found, but a direct hernia sac was felt. The floor of the groin canal was opened, the space in front of the peritoneum was cleared, and the direct sac was removed.  \n\nA PHS mesh was then placed in the space in front of the peritoneum. The mesh was laid flat along Cooper’s ligament and covered the area where the hernia could occur. The front part of the mesh was tucked under the outer oblique muscle, between the outer and inner oblique muscles. The mesh was secured to the pubic bone with a 0 Ethibond suture. The top of the mesh was tied to the inner oblique muscle and the bottom to the edge of the inguinal ligament. A hole was cut in the mesh so the groin cord could pass through, and the inner ring was rebuilt, making sure it was not too tight to avoid strangling the cord.  \n\nThe outer oblique muscle was closed with a running 3‑0 Vicryl stitch. Scarpa’s fascia was closed with interrupted 3‑0 Vicryl stitches, and the skin was closed with a running Monocril stitch. All sponges, instruments, and needles were counted correctly at the end. The patient tolerated the surgery well and had no complications."
