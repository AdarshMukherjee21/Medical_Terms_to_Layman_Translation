  "medical": "CC: Progressive loss of color vision OD HX: 58 y/o female presents with a one year history of progressive loss of color vision. In the past two months she has developed blurred vision and a central scotoma OD. There are no symptoms of photopsias, diplopia, headache, or eye pain. There are no other complaints. There have been mild fluctuations of her symptoms, but her vision has never returned to its baseline prior to symptom onset one year ago. EXAM: Visual acuity with correction: 20/25+1 OD; 20/20-1 OS. Pupils were 3.5mm OU. There was a 0.8 log unit RAPD OD. Intraocular pressures were 25 and 24, OD and OS respectively; and there was an increase to 27 on upgaze OD, but no increase on upgaze OS. Optic disk pallor was evident OD, but not OS. Additionally, there was a small area of peripheral chorioretinal scarring in the inferotemporal area of the right eye. Foveal flicker fusion occurred at a frequency of 21.9 OD and 30.7 OS. Color plate testing scores: 6/14 OD and 10/14 OS. Goldman visual field examination showed an enlarged and deepened blind spot with an infero-temporal defect especially in the smaller diopters. IMPRESSION ON 2/6/89: Optic neuropathy/atrophy OD, rule out mass lesion affecting optic nerve. Particular attention was paid to the area of the optic canal, cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus. BRAIN CT W/CONTRAST, 2/13/89: Enhancing calcified lesion in the posterior aspect of the right optic nerve, probable meningioma. MRI ORBITS W/ AND W/OUT GADOLINIUM CONTRAST, 4/26/89: 7x3mm irregular soft tissue mass just inferior and lateral to the optic nerve OD. The mass is just proximal to the orbital apex. There is relatively homogeneous enhancement of the mass. The findings are most consistent with meningioma. MRI 1995: Mild enlargement of tumor with possible slight extension into the right cavernous sinus. COURSE: Resection and biopsy were deferred due to risk of blindness, and suspicion that the tumor was a slow growing meningioma. 3 years after initial evaluation Hertel measurements indicated a 3mm proptosis OD. Visual field testing revealed gradual worsening of deficits seen on her initial Goldman visual field exam. There was greater red color desaturation of the temporal field OD. Visual acuity had decreased from 20/20 to 20/64, OD. All other deficits seen on her initial exam remained stable or slightly worsened. By 1996 she continued to be followed at 6 months intervals and had not undergone surgical resection.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Gradual loss of color vision in the right eye.  \n\n**History:** A 58‑year‑old woman has had this for one year. In the last two months she also has blurred vision and a blind spot in the center of her right eye. She does not see flashes of light, double vision, headaches, or eye pain, and has no other problems. Her symptoms have varied a little, but her vision has never returned to how it was before the symptoms started.  \n\n**Exam:**  \n- With glasses, vision is 20/25+1 in the right eye and 20/20‑1 in the left.  \n- Both pupils are 3.5 mm.  \n- The right eye has a relative afferent pupillary defect of 0.8 log units.  \n- Eye pressure is 25 mmHg in the right and 24 mmHg in the left; it rises to 27 mmHg when she looks up in the right eye, but not in the left.  \n- The optic disc looks pale in the right eye but normal in the left.  \n- There is a small scar in the outer lower part of the right eye.  \n- Flicker test shows 21.9 Hz in the right eye and 30.7 Hz in the left.  \n- Color vision test: 6 of 14 correct in the right eye, 10 of 14 in the left.  \n- Visual field test shows a larger, deeper blind spot and a missing area in the lower outer part of the right eye, especially with low‑power lenses.  \n\n**Impression (Feb 6 1989):** Damage to the optic nerve in the right eye; need to check for a mass. Focus on the optic canal, cavernous sinus, and sphenoid sinus.  \n\n**Imaging:**  \n- Brain CT with contrast (Feb 13 1989) showed a calcified, enhancing spot behind the right optic nerve, likely a meningioma.  \n- MRI of the eyes with and without gadolinium (Apr 26 1989) found a 7 × 3 mm irregular soft‑tissue mass just below and to the side of the right optic nerve, near the back of the orbit. The mass enhanced evenly and most likely is a meningioma.  \n- A 1995 MRI showed the tumor had grown a little and might have spread slightly into the right cavernous sinus.  \n\n**Course:** Surgery and a biopsy were postponed because they could cause blindness and because the tumor seemed slow‑growing. Three years later, eye measurements showed the right eye bulged 3 mm. Visual field tests showed the missing areas had gotten worse. Red color vision was even more reduced in the outer part of the right eye. Vision in the right eye dropped from 20/20 to 20/64. Other problems from the first exam stayed the same or got a little worse. By 1996 she was still being checked every six months and had not had surgery."
