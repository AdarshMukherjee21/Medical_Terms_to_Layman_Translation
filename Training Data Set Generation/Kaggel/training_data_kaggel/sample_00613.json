  "medical": "This is a 63-year-old female complaining of neck pain. Patient is status post MVA (rear-ended) on 02/10/2006. FINDINGS:Normal foramen magnum. Normal brainstem-cervical cord junction. There is no tonsillar ectopia. Normal clivus and craniovertebral junction. Normal anterior atlantoaxial articulation. C2-3: There is disc desiccation but no loss of disc space height, disc displacement, endplate spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina. C3-4: There is disc desiccation with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type. The small posterior central disc protrusion measures 3 x 6mm (AP x transverse) in size and is producing ventral thecal sac flattening. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 9mm. There is minimal right-sided uncovertebral joint arthrosis but no substantial foraminal compromise. C4-5: There is disc desiccation, slight loss of disc space height with a right posterior lateral pre-foraminal disc osteophyte complex with right-sided uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis. The disc osteophyte complex measures approximately 5mm in its AP dimension. There is minimal posterior annular bulging measuring approximately 2mm. The AP diameter of the central canal has been narrowed to 9mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. There is probable radicular impingement upon the exiting right C5 nerve root. C5-6: There is disc desiccation, moderate loss of disc space height with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type. The disc protrusion measures approximately 3 x 8mm (AP x transverse) in size. There is ventral thecal sac flattening with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. The residual AP diameter of the central canal has been narrowed to 7mm. Findings indicate a loss of the functional reserve of the central canal but there is no cord edema. There is bilateral uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis with moderate foraminal compromise. C6-7: There is disc desiccation, mild loss of disc space height with 2mm of posterior annular bulging. There is bilateral uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis (left greater than right) with probable radicular impingement upon the bilateral exiting C7 nerve roots. C7-T1, T1-2: There is disc desiccation with no disc displacement. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina. T3-4: There is disc desiccation with minimal 2mm posterior annular bulging but normal central canal and CSF surrounding the cord. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc disease with uncovertebral joint arthrosis with foraminal compromise as described above. C3-4 posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type but no cord impingement. C4-5 right posterior lateral disc osteophyte complex with right-sided uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis with probable radicular impingement upon the right C5 nerve root. C5-6 degenerative disc disease with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type producing borderline central canal stenosis with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft indicating a limited functional reserve of the central canal. C6-7 degenerative disc disease with annular bulging and osseous foraminal compromise with probable impingement upon the bilateral exiting C7 nerve roots. T3-4 degenerative disc disease with posterior annular bulging.",
  "layman": "This 63‑year‑old woman has neck pain. She was in a rear‑end car accident on February 10, 2006.  \n\n**Findings**\n\n- The opening at the base of the skull and the brain‑stem area are normal.  \n- The top of the spinal cord and the bones at the skull‑spine junction are normal.  \n- No downward displacement of the brainstem.  \n- The front part of the first two cervical vertebrae (C1‑C2) looks normal.  \n\n**Cervical spine (C2‑C7)**  \n\n- **C2‑C3**: The disc is dry but still has normal height and shape. No disc slip, bone wear, or narrowing of the spaces where nerves exit.  \n- **C3‑C4**: The disc is dry and has a small central bulge (3 mm front‑to‑back by 6 mm wide) that presses slightly on the front of the spinal cord. The space around the cord is still open (9 mm). There is a little bone wear on the right side, but it does not block the nerve exit.  \n- **C4‑C5**: The disc is dry and a little lower than normal. A small bone‑disc growth (about 5 mm front‑to‑back) on the right side presses on the right C5 nerve root. The space around the cord is 9 mm.  \n- **C5‑C6**: The disc is dry and has moderate loss of height. A central bulge (3 mm front‑to‑back by 8 mm wide) presses on the front of the spinal cord, narrowing the space to 7 mm. The cord itself is not swollen. Both sides show bone wear that narrows the nerve exit passages.  \n- **C6‑C7**: The disc is dry and a little lower. A 2 mm bulge at the back of the disc and bone wear on both sides (more on the left) likely press on the C7 nerve roots that exit on both sides.  \n- **C7‑T1 and T1‑T2**: The discs are dry but normal in shape and height. The spaces around the cord and nerves are normal.  \n- **T3‑T4**: The disc is dry with a small 2 mm bulge at the back; the space around the cord is normal.  \n\n**Impression**\n\n- Multiple levels of age‑related disc wear and bone wear that narrow the nerve exit passages.  \n- A small central disc bulge at C3‑C4 that does not press on the cord.  \n- A bone‑disc growth at C4‑C5 that probably presses on the right C5 nerve root.  \n- A central disc bulge at C5‑C6 that narrows the spinal canal and reduces the space around the cord.  \n- Bone wear and bulging at C6‑C7 that likely press on both C7 nerve roots.  \n- Minor disc bulging at T3‑T4."
