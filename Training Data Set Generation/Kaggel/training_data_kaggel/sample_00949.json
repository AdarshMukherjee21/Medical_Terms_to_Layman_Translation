  "medical": "SPECIMENS: 1. Pelvis-right pelvic obturator node. 2. Pelvis-left pelvic obturator node. 3. Prostate. POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of prostate, erectile dysfunction. DIAGNOSTIC OPINION: 1. Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 9, with tumor extension to periprostatic tissue, margin involvement, and tumor invasion to seminal vesicle, prostate. 2. No evidence of metastatic carcinoma, right pelvic obturator lymph node. 3. Metastatic adenocarcinoma, left obturator lymph node; see description. CLINICAL HISTORY: None listed. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Specimen #1 labeled &quot;right pelvic obturator lymph nodes&quot; consists of two portions of adipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 1x 0.8 cm and 2.5 x 1x 0.5 cm. There are two lymph nodes measuring 1 x 0.7 cm and 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The entire specimen is cut into several portions and totally embedded. Specimen #2 labeled &quot;left pelvic obturation lymph nodes&quot; consists of an adipose tissue measuring 4 x 2 x 1 cm. There are two lymph nodes measuring 1.3 x 0.8 cm and 1 x 0.6 cm. The entire specimen is cut into 1 cm. The entire specimen is cut into several portions and totally embedded. Specimen #3 labeled &quot;prostate&quot; consists of a prostate. It measures 5 x 4.5 x 4 cm. The external surface shows very small portion of seminal vesicles attached in both sides with tumor induration. External surface also shows tumor induration especially in right side. External surface is stained with green ink. The cut surface shows diffuse tumor induration especially in right side. The tumor appears to extend to excision margin. Multiple representative sections are made. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Section #1 reveals lymph node. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. Section #2 reveals lymph node with tumor metastasis in section of large lymph node as well as section of small lymph node. Section #3 reveals adenocarcinoma of prostate. Gleason's score 9 (5+4). The tumor shows extension to periprostatic tissue as well as margin involvement. Seminal vesicle attached to prostate tissue shows tumor invasion. Dr. XXX reviewed the above case. His opinion agrees with the above diagnosis. SUMMARY: A. Adenocarcinoma of prostate, Gleason's score 9, with both lobe involvement and seminal vesicle involvement (T3b). B. There is lymph node metastasis (N1). C. Distant metastasis cannot be assessed (MX). D. Excision margin is positive and there is tumor extension to periprostatic tissue.",

Prostate  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis**  \n- Prostate cancer (adenocarcinoma)  \n- Erectile dysfunction  \n\n**Diagnostic opinion**\n\n1. Prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 9. The tumor has spread into the tissue around the prostate, reached the surgical margin, and invaded the seminal vesicle.  \n2. No cancer found in the right pelvic obturator lymph node.  \n3. Cancer found in the left pelvic obturator lymph node (see details).  \n\n**Clinical history**  \n- No information provided.  \n\n**Gross description**\n\n*Specimen #1 – right pelvic obturator lymph nodes*  \n- Two pieces of fatty tissue: 2.5 × 1 × 0.8 cm and 2.5 × 1 × 0.5 cm.  \n- Two lymph nodes: 1 × 0.7 cm and 0.5 × 0.5 cm.  \n- The whole specimen was sliced into several pieces and fully embedded for examination.  \n\n*Specimen #2 – left pelvic obturator lymph nodes*  \n- One piece of fatty tissue: 4 × 2 × 1 cm.  \n- Two lymph nodes: 1.3 × 0.8 cm and 1 × 0.6 cm.  \n- The specimen was sliced into 1 cm sections and fully embedded.  \n\n*Specimen #3 – prostate*  \n- Size: 5 × 4.5 × 4 cm.  \n- The outer surface shows a small attached part of the seminal vesicle on both sides and a firm area of tumor, especially on the right side.  \n- The outer surface was marked with green ink.  \n- The cut surface shows widespread firm tumor, especially on the right side, and the tumor reaches the surgical margin.  \n- Multiple representative sections were taken.  \n\n**Microscopic description**\n\n- *Section #1*: lymph node – no cancer seen.  \n- *Section #2*: lymph node – cancer cells present in both the large and small lymph nodes.  \n- *Section #3*: prostate – adenocarcinoma with Gleason score 9 (5 + 4). The tumor extends into the tissue around the prostate, involves the surgical margin, and has invaded the attached seminal vesicle.  \n\nThe pathologist reviewed the case and agrees with the diagnosis.  \n\n**Summary**\n\nA. Prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 9, involving both lobes of the prostate and the seminal vesicle (stage T3b).  \nB. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes (N1).  \nC. Distant spread could not be evaluated (MX).  \nD. The surgical margin is positive and the tumor extends into the surrounding tissue."
