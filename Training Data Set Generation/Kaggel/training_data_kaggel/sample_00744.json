  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal abscess. OPERATION: Incision and drainage of the penoscrotal abscess, packing, penile biopsy, cystoscopy, and urethral dilation. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 75-year-old male presented with penoscrotal abscess. Options such as watchful waiting, drainage, and antibiotics were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, completely the infection turning into necrotizing fascitis, Fournier's gangrene were discussed. The patient already had significant phimotic changes and disfigurement of the penis. For further debridement the patient was told that his penis is not going to be viable, he may need a total or partial penectomy now or in the future. Risks of decreased penile sensation, pain, Foley, other unexpected issues were discussed. The patient understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAIL OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Pictures were taken prior to starting the procedure for documentation. The patient had an open sore on the right side of the penis measuring about 1 cm in size with pouring pus out using blunt dissection. The penile area was opened up distally to allow the pus to come out. The dissection around the proximal scrotum was done to make sure there are no other pus pockets. The corporal body was intact, but the distal part of the corpora was completely eroded and had a fungating mass, which was biopsied and sent for permanent pathology analysis. Urethra was identified at the distal tip, which was dilated and using 23-French cystoscope cystoscopy was done, which showed some urethral narrowing in the distal part of the urethra. The rest of the bladder appeared normal. The prostatic urethra was slightly enlarged. There are no stones or tumors inside the bladder. There were moderate trabeculations inside the bladder. Otherwise, the bladder and the urethra appeared normal. There was a significantly fungating mass involving the distal part of the urethra almost possibility to have including the fungating wart or fungating squamous cell carcinoma. Again biopsies were sent for pathology analysis. Prior to urine irrigation anaerobic aerobic cultures were sent, irrigation with over 2 L of fluid was performed. After irrigation, packing was done with Kerlix. The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition. Please note that 18-French Foley was kept in place. Electrocautery was used at the end of the procedure to obtain hemostasis as much as possible, but there was fungating mass with slight bleeding packing was done and tight scrotal Kling was applied. The patient was brought to Recovery in a stable condition after applying 0.5% Marcaine about 20 mL were injected around for local anesthesia.",

We talked about waiting, draining, and antibiotics. We explained the risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, heart attack, blood clots, and the possibility of the infection spreading to become necrotizing fascitis or Fournier’s gangrene. The man already had tight skin and a distorted penis. We told him that if more tissue had to be removed, his penis might not survive and he could need a partial or full penectomy now or later. We also discussed possible loss of sensation, pain, the need for a Foley catheter, and other unexpected problems. He understood all of this and decided to have the surgery.\n\n**Details of the operation:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and positioned on his back with his legs apart. He was cleaned and covered in the usual way. We took pictures before starting for records.  \nAn open sore on the right side of the penis, about 1 cm, was found and pus was drained with gentle cutting. We opened the area near the tip of the penis so the pus could flow out. We also cut around the upper part of the scrotum to make sure there were no other pockets of pus. The main body of the penis was intact, but the lower part was badly damaged and had a large, growing mass. We took a biopsy of this mass for permanent pathology.  \nWe located the urethra at the tip, widened it, and used a 23‑French cystoscope. The scope showed some narrowing in the lower urethra. The bladder looked normal, except for a slightly enlarged prostate and moderate thickening of the bladder walls. No stones or tumors were seen. The lower urethra had a large, growing mass that could be a wart or squamous cell cancer; we also biopsied this.  \nBefore irrigating the area, we sent samples for anaerobic and aerobic cultures. We irrigated with more than 2 L of fluid. After irrigation, we packed the wound with Kerlix gauze.  \nThe patient was moved to recovery in stable condition. An 18‑French Foley catheter was left in place. We used electrocautery at the end to stop bleeding as much as possible. Because of the growing mass, there was some bleeding, so we packed again and applied a tight scrotal sling.  \nIn recovery, we injected 20 mL of 0.5 % Marcaine around the area for local pain relief. The patient remained stable."
