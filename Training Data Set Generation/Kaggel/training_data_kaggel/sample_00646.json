  "medical": "CIRCUMCISION - OLDER PERSON OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 4-0 silk suture is used as a stay-stitch of the glans penis. Next, incision line was marked circumferentially on the outer skin 3 mm below the corona. The incision was then carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissues down to within a layer of * fascia. Next, the foreskin was retracted. Another circumferential incision was made 3 mm proximal to the corona. The intervening foreskin was excised. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock. The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges. Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure. Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast dressing was applied. The stay-stitch was removed and pressure held until bleeding stopped. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "**Circumcision – Older Person Operative Note**\n\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laid flat on the table. General anesthesia was given through a breathing tube. The area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A 4‑0 silk thread was used to hold the tip of the penis in place. The surgeon marked a circle on the outer skin about 3 mm below the head of the penis. The cut was made through the skin and the tissue underneath to just above the deep layer of fascia. The foreskin was pulled back. A second circle was cut about 3 mm above the head of the penis. The skin between the two circles was removed. The surgeon stopped any bleeding with an electric cautery device. The skin was then stitched back together at the frenulum with a U‑shaped stitch using 5‑0 chromic thread, followed by stitches at the 12, 3, and 9 o’clock positions. The stitches were spaced evenly to bring all the skin edges together. The result looked good and there was no bleeding at the end of the surgery. A dressing of Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast was applied. The hold‑stitch was taken out and pressure was applied until bleeding stopped. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
