  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: CVA. INDICATIONS: CVA. This is technically acceptable. There is some limitation related to body habitus. DIMENSIONS: The interventricular septum 1.2, posterior wall 10.9, left ventricular end-diastolic 5.5, and end-systolic 4.5, the left atrium 3.9. FINDINGS: The left atrium was mildly dilated. No masses or thrombi were seen. The left ventricle showed borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with normal wall motion and wall thickening, EF of 60%. The right atrium and right ventricle are normal in size. Mitral valve showed mitral annular calcification in the posterior aspect of the valve. The valve itself was structurally normal. No vegetations seen. No significant MR. Mitral inflow pattern was consistent with diastolic dysfunction grade 1. The aortic valve showed minimal thickening with good exposure and coaptation. Peak velocity is normal. No AI. Pulmonic and tricuspid valves were both structurally normal. Interatrial septum was appeared to be intact in the views obtained. A bubble study was not performed. No pericardial effusion was seen. Aortic arch was not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with normal ejection fraction at 60%. 2. Mitral annular calcification with structurally normal mitral valve. 3. No intracavitary thrombi is seen. 4. Interatrial septum was somewhat difficult to assess, but appeared to be intact on the views obtained.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam:** Stroke (CVA).  \n**Indications:** Stroke. The exam is acceptable, but the patient’s body shape made some measurements a bit harder.\n\n**Measurements (in centimeters):**  \n- Interventricular septum: 1.2  \n- Posterior wall: 10.9  \n- Left ventricle at the end of filling (diastole): 5.5  \n- Left ventricle at the end of contraction (systole): 4.5  \n- Left atrium: 3.9  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The left atrium is slightly enlarged.  \n- No tumors or blood clots were found.  \n- The left ventricle shows mild thickening (borderline hypertrophy) but moves normally; its pumping ability (ejection fraction) is 60%.  \n- The right atrium and right ventricle are normal in size.  \n- The mitral valve has calcium deposits on its back part (annular calcification) but the valve itself looks normal. No abnormal growths (vegetations) or significant leaking (mitral regurgitation). The blood flow pattern suggests mild diastolic dysfunction (grade 1).  \n- The aortic valve is slightly thickened but functions well; it closes properly and the peak blood flow speed is normal. No aortic regurgitation.  \n- The pulmonic and tricuspid valves look normal.  \n- The wall between the two atria (interatrial septum) appears intact in the images taken, though it was a bit hard to see clearly.  \n- A bubble study was not done.  \n- No fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion).  \n- The aortic arch was not examined.\n\n**Conclusions:**  \n1. Mild thickening of the left ventricle with a normal pumping function (60%).  \n2. Calcium deposits on the mitral valve’s back part, but the valve itself is normal.  \n3. No blood clots inside the heart chambers.  \n4. The wall between the atria looks intact, though it was difficult to assess fully."
