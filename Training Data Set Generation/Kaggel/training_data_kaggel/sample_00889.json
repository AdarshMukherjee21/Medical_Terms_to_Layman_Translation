  "medical": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: Nausea. PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 28-year-old, who is status post gastric bypass surgery nearly one year ago. He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back. He feels like he was on it but has not done so. He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3. He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms. His last normal bowel movement was yesterday. He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension and morbid obesity, now resolved. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Gastric bypass surgery in December 2007. MEDICATIONS: Multivitamins and calcium. ALLERGIES: None known. FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes mellitus in his father, who is now deceased. SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco or alcohol. He has what sounds like a data entry computer job. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 100.3, blood pressure 129/59, respirations 16, heart rate 84. He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation. He is oriented to person, place, and situation. He is normocephalic, atraumatic. His sclerae are anicteric. His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky. His neck is supple and symmetric. His respirations are unlabored and clear. He has a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is soft. He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding. He otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident. His extremities are symmetrical with no edema. His posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric. He is grossly nonfocal neurologically. STUDIES: His white blood cell count is 8.4 with 79 segs. His hematocrit is 41. His electrolytes are normal. His bilirubin is 2.8. His AST 349, ALT 186, alk-phos 138 and lipase is normal at 239. ASSESSMENT: Choledocholithiasis, ? cholecystitis. PLAN: He will be admitted and placed on IV antibiotics. We will get an ultrasound this morning. He will need his gallbladder out, probably with intraoperative cholangiogram. Hopefully, the stone will pass this way. Due to his anatomy, an ERCP would prove quite difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted. Dr. X will see him later this morning and discuss the plan further. The patient understands.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Nausea.  \n\n**History of present illness:** A 28‑year‑old man who had gastric bypass surgery almost a year ago. He has lost about 200 pounds and was doing well until yesterday evening around 7–8 p.m. He started feeling nauseous and had pain in the upper right side of his belly that spread toward his right side and back. He feels like he was vomiting but has not. He feels generally unwell and has a low‑grade fever of 100.3 °F. He has never had similar symptoms before. His last normal bowel movement was yesterday. He does not have chills or blood in his stool.  \n\n**Past medical history:** High blood pressure and severe obesity, both now resolved.  \n\n**Past surgical history:** Gastric bypass in December 2007.  \n\n**Medications:** Multivitamins and calcium.  \n\n**Allergies:** None.  \n\n**Family history:** Father had diabetes (deceased).  \n\n**Social history:** No tobacco or alcohol use. Works a computer job.  \n\n**Review of systems:** No other problems.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Temperature 100.3 °F, blood pressure 129/59, breathing 16/min, heart rate 84.  \n- He is drowsy but can be awakened easily and talks normally. He knows who he is, where he is, and why he is here.  \n- Head is normal shape, no head injury.  \n- Eyes are not yellow.  \n- Mouth is a little dry.  \n- Neck is flexible and looks normal.  \n- Breathing is normal and clear.  \n- Heart beats at a regular rate.  \n- Abdomen is soft. He has tenderness in the upper right part of his belly, worse in one spot, but no sharp pain or guarding. No enlarged organs, lumps, or hernias.  \n- Limbs are normal, no swelling. Pulses in the back of his lower legs are normal.  \n- No obvious neurological problems.  \n\n**Lab results:**  \n- White blood cells 8.4 k/µL with 79 % neutrophils.  \n- Hematocrit 41 %.  \n- Electrolytes normal.  \n- Bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL.  \n- AST 349 U/L, ALT 186 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 138 U/L.  \n- Lipase 239 U/L (normal).  \n\n**Assessment:** Gallstones in the common bile duct, possibly gallbladder inflammation.  \n\n**Plan:** He will be admitted and given IV antibiotics. An ultrasound will be done this morning. He will likely need his gallbladder removed, probably with an intraoperative cholangiogram. The goal is to remove the stone. Because of his anatomy, an ERCP would be very hard or impossible unless assisted laparoscopically. Dr. X will see him later this morning to discuss the plan. The patient understands."
