  "medical": "PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Colonoscopy. INDICATIONS: Renewed symptoms likely consistent with active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, not responsive to conventional therapy including sulfasalazine, cortisone, local therapy. PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure with special attention to benefits, risks, alternatives. Risks explained as bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications. Vital signs were monitored by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Supplemental O2 given. Specifics discussed. Preprocedure physical exam performed. Stable vital signs. Lungs clear. Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm. Abdomen soft. Her past history, her past workup, her past visitation with me for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, well responsive to sulfasalazine reviewed. She currently has a flare and is not responding, therefore, likely may require steroid taper. At the same token, her symptoms are mild. She has rectal bleeding, essentially only some rusty stools. There is not significant diarrhea, just some lower stools. No significant pain. Therefore, it is possible that we are just dealing with a hemorrhoidal bleed, therefore, colonoscopy now needed. Past history reviewed. Specifics of workup, need for followup, and similar discussed. All questions answered. A normal digital rectal examination was performed. The PCF-160 AL was inserted into the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, as identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendical orifice. All mucosal aspects thoroughly inspected, including a retroflexed examination. Withdrawal time was greater than six minutes. Unfortunately, the terminal ileum could not be intubated despite multiple attempts. Findings were those of a normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon. A small cecal polyp was noted, this was biopsy-removed, placed in bottle #1. Random biopsies from the cecum obtained, bottle #2; random biopsies from the transverse colon obtained, as well as descending colon obtained, bottle #3. There was an area of inflammation in the proximal sigmoid colon, which was biopsied, placed in bottle #4. There was an area of relative sparing, with normal sigmoid lining, placed in bottle #5, randomly biopsied, and then inflammation again in the distal sigmoid colon and rectum biopsied, bottle #6, suggesting that we may be dealing with Crohn disease, given the relative sparing of the sigmoid colon and junk lesion. Retroflexed showed hemorrhoidal disease. Scope was then withdrawn, patient left in good condition. IMPRESSION: Active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, question of Crohn disease. PLAN: I will have the patient follow up with me, will follow up on histology, follow up on the polyps. She will be put on a steroid taper and make an appointment and hopefully steroids alone will do the job. If not, she may be started on immune suppressive medication, such as azathioprine, or similar. All of this has been reviewed with the patient. All questions answered.",
  "layman": "**PROCEDURES PERFORMED:** Colonoscopy.  \n\n**INDICATIONS:** The patient’s symptoms have come back and look like an active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The flare has not improved with usual medicines such as sulfasalazine, cortisone, or local treatments.  \n\n**PROCEDURE:**  \n- The patient gave informed consent after we explained the benefits, risks, and alternatives.  \n- Risks mentioned included bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or a reaction to the medications.  \n- Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level) were monitored. Supplemental oxygen was given.  \n- A pre‑procedure physical exam was done. Vital signs were stable. Lungs were clear. Heart rhythm was regular. Abdomen was soft.  \n- We reviewed her medical history, previous work‑ups, and past visits for IBD, noting that she had responded well to sulfasalazine before.  \n- She now has a flare that is not responding, so she may need a steroid taper. Her symptoms are mild: some rusty stool and a little rectal bleeding, but no severe diarrhea or pain. It could be hemorrhoids, so a colonoscopy is needed.  \n- All questions were answered.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \n- A normal digital rectal exam was performed.  \n- The colonoscope (PCF‑160 AL) was inserted through the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendix opening.  \n- The entire lining of the colon was inspected, including a retroflexed view.  \n- Withdrawal time was over six minutes.  \n- The terminal ileum could not be reached after several attempts.  \n- Findings: normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, and descending colon.  \n- A small polyp was found in the cecum, removed and placed in bottle #1.  \n- Random biopsies were taken from the cecum (bottle #2), transverse colon, and descending colon (bottle #3).  \n- Inflammation was seen in the upper part of the sigmoid colon; a biopsy was taken (bottle #4).  \n- A normal area of sigmoid colon was biopsied (bottle #5).  \n- Inflammation again in the lower sigmoid colon and rectum; biopsies taken (bottle #6). These patterns suggest Crohn disease, with the sigmoid colon showing “relative sparing.”  \n- Retroflexed view showed hemorrhoidal disease.  \n- The scope was withdrawn and the patient left in good condition.  \n\n**IMPRESSION:** Active flare of IBD, possibly Crohn disease.  \n\n**PLAN:**  \n- The patient will follow up with me.  \n- We will review the biopsy results and the polyp.  \n- She will start a steroid taper; if steroids alone are not enough, we may add an immune‑suppressing drug such as azathioprine.  \n- All of this was discussed with the patient and all questions were answered."
