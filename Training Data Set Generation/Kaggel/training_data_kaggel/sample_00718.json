  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage. Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out. It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall. CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease. Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease. MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia. INSTRUMENT: Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FINDINGS: With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia. The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx. The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern. Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors. It appeared normal and appeared to function normally. The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air. Rugal folds were flattened completely. There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach. The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology. Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing. Excess air was evacuated from the stomach. The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well. The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy. Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock. The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge. The colonic clean out was excellent. The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum. The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate. The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum. The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon. Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm. No fistulas were noted in the colon. Excess air was evacuated from the colon. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition. IMPRESSION: Normal esophagus and duodenum. There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve. All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease. PLAN: Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily. Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results. If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion. We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy. Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate. We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula. He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy. If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:**  \nThe patient had an upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with tissue samples taken, and a colonoscopy with tissue samples taken.\n\n**Why the procedure was done:**  \nA 17‑year‑old boy has lost about 40 pounds, has abdominal pain, and had an appendix removed. He has had repeated abscesses that needed drainage. He now has a fistula (an abnormal opening) that comes out of the front of his abdominal wall. The opening does not seem to connect to his digestive tract; it just goes from the front surface of the rectus muscles to the skin. A CT scan shows the last part of his small intestine (terminal ileum) is thickened, which suggests Crohn’s disease. The endoscopy is being done to look for Crohn’s disease.\n\n**Medications and equipment:**  \nHe was given general anesthesia. The doctors used an Olympus GIF‑160 and PCF‑160 scope.\n\n**Complications:**  \nNone.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:**  \nLess than 5 mL.\n\n**Findings – Upper endoscopy:**  \nThe patient lay on his back and was intubated. The scope was passed easily into the throat and down the esophagus, which looked normal. The lower esophageal sphincter was at 40 cm from the front teeth and looked normal. The scope entered the stomach, which was full of air. The folds in the stomach were flattened. There were many small superficial erosions (tiny sores) scattered in the fundus, body, and antrum of the stomach, which are typical of Crohn’s disease. The scope then went through the pyloric valve into the first, second, and third parts of the duodenum, which looked normal. Biopsies were taken from the second part of the duodenum, the antrum, the body, and the lower esophagus (at 37 cm from the front teeth). Two more biopsies were taken from the antrum for a CLO test. The excess air was removed from the stomach. The scope was taken out and the patient tolerated this part well.\n\n**Findings – Colonoscopy:**  \nThe patient was turned and a different scope was used for the colon. Before starting, a perianal fistula was seen at the 7 o’clock position. The colonoscope was inserted at the anus. The colon was clean. The scope was advanced easily to the cecum. The cecum had many ulcers with pus. The ileocecal valve (the junction between the small and large intestine) was very distorted. Two biopsies were taken from the cecum. The scope was then withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum. The colon lining was seen well, with a few small aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon. Biopsies were taken from the cecum (65 cm), transverse colon (50 cm), rectosigmoid (20 cm), and rectum (5 cm). No fistulas were seen in the colon. Excess air was removed from the colon. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in good condition.\n\n**Impression:**  \nThe esophagus and duodenum are normal. The stomach has many superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers, and the colon has a few scattered aphthous ulcers, especially large ulcers in the cecum and a very irregular ileocecal valve. These findings are consistent with Crohn’s disease.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Start prednisone 30 mg by mouth daily.  \n- Wait for PPD, chest X‑ray, and cocci serology results. If those are normal, we will recommend a Remicade (infliximab) infusion of 5 mg/kg IV.  \n- Begin Modulon (a nutrition supplement) at 50 mL/h for 20 hours to help reverse the boy’s malnutrition.  \n- Check CMP and phosphate levels every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to monitor for refeeding syndrome, paying attention to potassium and phosphate.  \n- Discuss with Dr. X about possibly repeating a CT fistulogram if the previous images are unclear about whether an enterocutaneous fistula exists.  \n- He will need an upper GI study to rule out small‑bowel strictures and involvement that cannot be seen with the current endoscopies.  \n- If no small‑bowel strictures are found, we would recommend a video capsule endoscopy to look for any mucosal lesions in the small intestine that are not visible with standard endoscopy."
