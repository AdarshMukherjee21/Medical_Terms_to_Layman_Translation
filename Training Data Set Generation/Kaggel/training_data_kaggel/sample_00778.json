  "medical": "DESCRIPTION: 1. Normal cardiac chambers size. 2. Normal left ventricular size. 3. Normal LV systolic function. Ejection fraction estimated around 60%. 4. Aortic valve seen with good motion. 5. Mitral valve seen with good motion. 6. Tricuspid valve seen with good motion. 7. No pericardial effusion or intracardiac masses. DOPPLER: 1. Trace mitral regurgitation. 2. Trace tricuspid regurgitation. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal LV systolic function. 2. Ejection fraction estimated around 60%.",
  "layman": "**Description:**  \n1. The heart chambers are the normal size.  \n2. The left ventricle is the normal size.  \n3. The left ventricle is pumping normally, with an ejection fraction about 60%.  \n4. The aortic valve moves well.  \n5. The mitral valve moves well.  \n6. The tricuspid valve moves well.  \n7. There is no fluid around the heart and no masses inside the heart.  \n\n**Doppler findings:**  \n1. A very small amount of mitral valve leakage.  \n2. A very small amount of tricuspid valve leakage.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. The left ventricle is pumping normally.  \n2. The ejection fraction is about 60%."
