  "medical": "CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY FOR CURATIVE INTENT PATIENTS This patient is receiving combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy in an effort to maximize the chance of control of this cancer. The chemotherapy is given in addition to the radiotherapy, not only to act as a cytotoxic agent on its own, but also to potentiate and enhance the effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells. It has been shown in the literature that this will maximize the chance of control. During the course of the treatment, the patient's therapy must be closely monitored by the attending physician to be sure that the proper chemotherapy drugs are given at the proper time during the radiotherapy course. It is also important to closely monitor the patient to know when treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy needs to be held. This combined treatment usually produces greater side effects than either treatment alone, and these need to be constantly monitored and treatment initiated on a timely basis to minimize these effects. In accordance, this requires more frequency consultation and coordination with the medical oncologist. Therefore, this becomes a very time intensive treatment and justifies CPT Code 77470.",
  "layman": "**Combined Chemotherapy and Radiation for Curative Treatment**\n\nThis patient is getting both radiation and chemotherapy at the same time to give the best chance of stopping the cancer. The chemotherapy is added not only to kill cancer cells directly but also to make the radiation work better. Studies show that this approach increases the likelihood of controlling the tumor.\n\nDuring treatment, the doctor must closely watch the patient to make sure the right chemotherapy drugs are given at the right times with the radiation. The patient also needs careful monitoring to decide if either the chemotherapy or radiation should be paused. Because the two treatments together can cause more side effects than either one alone, these side effects must be watched closely and treated quickly to keep them from getting worse. This means more frequent check‑ups and close teamwork with the medical oncologist. The extra time and coordination needed justify using CPT Code 77470."
