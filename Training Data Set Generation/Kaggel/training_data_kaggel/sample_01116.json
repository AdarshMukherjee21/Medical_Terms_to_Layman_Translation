  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female with low back pain radiating down the left leg and foot for one and a half years. FINDINGS: High resolution computerized tomography was performed from T12-L1 to the S1 level with reformatted images in the sagittal and coronal planes and 3D reconstructions performed. COMPARISON: Previous MRI examination 10/13/2004. There is minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex to the left. T12-L1, L1-2, L2-3: There is normal disc height with no posterior annular disc bulging or protrusion. Normal central canal, intervertebral neural foramina and facet joints. L3-4: There is normal disc height and non-compressive circumferential annular disc bulging eccentrically greater to the left. Normal central canal and facet joints (image #255). L4-5: There is normal disc height, circumferential annular disc bulging, left L5 hemilaminectomy and posterior central/right paramedian broad-based disc protrusion measuring 4mm (AP) contouring the rightward aspect of the thecal sac. Orthopedic hardware is noted posteriorly at the L5 level. Normal central canal, facet joints and intervertebral neural foramina (image #58). L5-S1: There is minimal decreased disc height, postsurgical change with intervertebral disc spacer, posterior lateral orthopedic hardware with bilateral pedicle screws in good postsurgical position. The orthopedic hardware creates mild streak artifact which mildly degrades images. There is a laminectomy defect, spondylolisthesis with 3.5mm of anterolisthesis of L5, posterior annular disc bulging greatest in the left foraminal region lying adjacent to the exiting left L5 nerve root. There is fusion of the facet joints, normal central canal and right neural foramen (image #69-70, 135). There is no bony destructive change noted. There is no perivertebral soft tissue abnormality. There is minimal to mild arteriosclerotic vascular calcifications noted in the abdominal aorta and right proximal common iliac artery. IMPRESSION: Minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex to the left. L3-4 posterior non-compressive annular disc bulging eccentrically greater to the left. L4-5 circumferential annular disc bulging, non-compressive central/right paramedian disc protrusion, left L5 laminectomy. L5-S1 postsurgical change with posterolateral orthopedic fusion hardware in good postsurgical position, intervertebral disc spacer, spondylolisthesis, laminectomy defect, posterior annular disc bulging greatest in the left foraminal region adjacent to the exiting left L5 nerve root with questionable neural impingement. Minimal to mild arteriosclerotic vascular calcifications.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged woman who has had lower back pain that shoots down her left leg and foot for about a year and a half.  \n\n**Findings**  \nA high‑resolution CT scan was done from the lower thoracic spine (T12‑L1) down to the first sacral vertebra (S1). The images were reformatted in side‑view (sagittal) and front‑view (coronal) planes and also shown in 3‑D.  \n\n**Comparison**  \nThe scan was compared with an MRI taken on 10/13/2004.  \n\n**Spine description**  \n\n- **General** – The lower back has a slight curve that bends to the left.  \n- **T12‑L1, L1‑2, L2‑3** – The discs are the normal height and there is no bulging or protrusion of the disc material. The spinal canal, the openings for the nerves (foramina), and the facet joints are all normal.  \n- **L3‑4** – The disc height is normal. The disc bulges a little on the outer edge, more on the left side, but it is not pressing on the spinal canal or the facet joints.  \n- **L4‑5** – The disc height is normal. The disc bulges around the whole circumference and there is a small, 4 mm protrusion on the right side that follows the outer edge of the spinal canal. A surgical removal of part of the bone (laminectomy) was done on the left side at L5, and there is a piece of metal hardware behind L5. The spinal canal, facet joints, and nerve openings are normal.  \n- **L5‑S1** – The disc height is slightly reduced. This area has had surgery: a disc spacer was placed, and metal screws and rods were put on the back side to hold the bones together. The metal makes a small streak on the images. There is a small defect where bone was removed (laminectomy). The L5 vertebra has slipped forward 3.5 mm (spondylolisthesis). The disc bulges most on the left side, right next to the left L5 nerve root. The facet joints are fused together. The spinal canal and the right nerve opening are normal. No bone damage or abnormal soft tissue is seen.  \n\n**Other findings** – Small to mild calcification of the arteries in the abdomen and the right iliac artery, indicating early arteriosclerosis.  \n\n**Impression**  \n- Slight left‑bending curve of the lower spine.  \n- Small, non‑pressing disc bulge at L3‑4, more on the left.  \n- Around L4‑5: disc bulge all around, a small right‑side protrusion, and a previous left‑side laminectomy.  \n- At L5‑S1: surgical changes with metal hardware in good position, a disc spacer, a small slip of L5 forward, a bone removal defect, and a disc bulge on the left next to the left L5 nerve root that may be pressing on the nerve.  \n- Mild arterial calcification."
