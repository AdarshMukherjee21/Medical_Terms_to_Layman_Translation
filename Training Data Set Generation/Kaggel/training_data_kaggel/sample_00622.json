PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This is a 38-year-old diabetic Hispanic female patient, with ongoing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea. Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis. The patient also had somewhat thickened gallbladder wall. The patient was admitted through emergency room last night with acute onset right upper quadrant pain. Clinically, it was felt the patient had acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram was advised. Procedure, indication, risk, and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail preoperatively and informed consent was obtained. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia, and abdomen was prepped and draped. A small transverse incision was made just above the umbilicus under local anesthesia. Fascia was opened vertically. Stay sutures were placed in the fascia. Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered. Hasson cannula was inserted and peritoneal cavity was insufflated with CO2. Laparoscopic camera was inserted, and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg, rotated to the left. A 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region. Examination at this time showed no free fluid, no acute inflammatory changes. Liver was grossly normal. Gallbladder was noted to be thickened. Gallbladder wall with a stone stuck in the neck of the gallbladder and pericholecystic edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis. The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly, and dissection was carried at the neck of the gallbladder where a cystic duct was identified and isolated. It was clipped distally and using C-arm fluoroscopy, intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done, which was interpreted as normal. There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted. It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly. The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips. Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided. The gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port. Specimen was sent for histopathology. Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution. Hemostasis was good. Trocars were removed under direct vision and peritoneal cavity was evacuated with CO2. Umbilical area fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, required extra sutures to close the fascial defect. Some difficulty was encountered closing the fascia initially because of the patient's significant amount of subcutaneous fat. In the end, the repair appears to be quite satisfactory. Rest of the incisions closed with 3-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses:**  \n1. Gallstones (cholelithiasis).  \n2. Sudden inflammation of the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis).\n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses:**  \n1. Inflammation of the gallbladder that is both new and ongoing (acute on chronic cholecystitis).  \n2. Gallstones.\n\n**Procedure performed:**  \nLaparoscopic removal of the gallbladder with a bile duct X‑ray (cholangiogram).\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia (the patient was asleep and fully relaxed).\n\n**Indications for surgery:**  \nThe patient is a 38‑year‑old Hispanic woman with diabetes. She has had repeated episodes of pain in the upper right part of her belly and nausea. An ultrasound showed gallstones and a slightly thickened gallbladder wall. She was admitted from the emergency room last night with sudden right‑upper‑belly pain. Doctors thought she had acute gallbladder inflammation and decided to do a laparoscopic gallbladder removal with a bile duct X‑ray. The risks, benefits, and other options were explained to her and she gave written permission.\n\n**Description of the procedure:**  \nThe patient lay on her back on the operating table and was given general anesthesia. The belly was cleaned and covered. A small horizontal cut was made just above the belly button, and the layers of tissue were opened. Small stitches were placed to keep the opening open. The belly cavity was entered carefully. A special tube (Hasson cannula) was put in and the cavity was filled with carbon dioxide gas to give the surgeons space to work. A camera was inserted, and the patient’s body was tilted slightly upward and turned to the left.\n\nThree small ports were placed: one 11‑mm hole near the sternum and two 5‑mm holes under the ribs on the right side. The surgeon looked inside and saw no fluid or obvious inflammation. The liver looked normal. The gallbladder was thickened and had a stone stuck in its neck, with swelling around it—typical of acute inflammation. The top of the gallbladder was pulled up, and the surgeon cut around the neck where the cystic duct (the tube that carries bile from the gallbladder) was found. The duct was clipped (tied off) at the end and a small X‑ray was taken while the patient was still in the operating room. The X‑ray showed the duct was normal, though there was a slight widening where the right and left bile ducts join, probably a harmless birth difference. The duct was clipped again near its base and cut beyond the clips. The cystic artery (the blood vessel feeding the gallbladder) was found, clipped twice near its base, once near its end, and cut. The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using cautery (electric heat) and taken out through the belly‑button port. The removed gallbladder was sent to the lab for microscopic examination. The spaces under the liver and diaphragm were washed with sterile salt water. Bleeding was controlled well. The ports were removed while looking inside, and the gas was let out. The belly‑button opening was closed with a figure‑of‑eight stitch using 0‑Vicryl. Extra stitches were needed because the patient had a lot of belly fat, but the repair looks good. The other small cuts were closed with 3‑0 Vicryl for the tissue and staples for the skin. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient was moved to the recovery room in stable condition."
