  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old right-handed female with longstanding bilateral arm pain, which is predominantly in the medial aspect of her arms and hands as well as left hand numbness, worse at night and after doing repetitive work with her left hand. She denies any weakness. No significant neck pain, change in bowel or bladder symptoms, change in gait, or similar symptoms in the past. She is on Lyrica for the pain, which has been somewhat successful. Examination reveals positive Phalen's test on the left. Remainder of her neurological examination is normal. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: The left median motor distal latency is prolonged with normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity. The left median sensory distal latency is prolonged with an attenuated evoked response amplitude. The right median sensory distal latency is mildly prolonged with a mildly attenuated evoked response amplitude. The right median motor distal latency and evoked response amplitude is normal. Left ulnar motor and sensory and left radial sensory responses are normal. Left median F-wave is normal. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the left arm, right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and bilateral cervical paraspinal muscles. It revealed spontaneous activity in the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle. There is increased insertional activity in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Both interosseous muscles showed signs of reinnervation. Left extensor digitorum communis muscle showed evidence of reduced recruitment. Cervical paraspinal muscles were normal. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: A left median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome. Electrical abnormalities are moderate-to-mild bilateral C8 radiculopathies. This may be an incidental finding. I have recommended MRI of the spine without contrast and report will be sent to Dr. XYZ. She will follow up with Dr. XYZ with respect to treatment of the above conditions.",
  "layman": "**History:**  \nThe patient is a 52‑year‑old right‑handed woman who has had pain in both arms for a long time. The pain is mainly on the inside of her arms and hands, and she also feels numbness in her left hand. The symptoms get worse at night and after doing repetitive work with her left hand. She says she does not feel weak. She has no neck pain, no changes in bowel or bladder function, no trouble walking, and has never had similar symptoms before. She takes Lyrica for the pain, which helps a little. On exam, a test called Phalen’s test is positive on the left side. The rest of her neurological exam is normal.\n\n**Nerve Conduction Studies:**  \n- Left median nerve (motor): the signal takes longer than normal, but the strength of the response and speed are normal.  \n- Left median nerve (sensory): the signal takes longer and the response is weaker.  \n- Right median nerve (sensory): the signal is slightly slower and the response is slightly weaker.  \n- Right median nerve (motor): normal.  \n- Left ulnar and left radial nerves: normal.  \n- Left median F‑wave: normal.\n\n**Needle EMG:**  \nTests were done on the left arm, the right first dorsal interosseous muscle (between the thumb and index finger), and muscles along the neck. Findings:  \n- The left abductor pollicis brevis muscle (thumb muscle) shows spontaneous activity.  \n- The right first dorsal interosseous muscle has increased activity when the muscle is first activated.  \n- Both interosseous muscles show signs that nerves are trying to re‑innervate them.  \n- The left extensor digitorum communis muscle (back of the forearm) shows reduced recruitment of muscle fibers.  \n- Neck muscles are normal.\n\n**Impression:**  \nThe electrical tests are abnormal. They show:  \n- A left median nerve problem at the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.  \n- Moderate‑to‑mild nerve root issues on both sides at the C8 level of the spine; these may just be incidental findings.  \nThe doctor has recommended an MRI of the spine without contrast and will send the report to Dr. XYZ. The patient will follow up with Dr. XYZ for treatment of these conditions."
