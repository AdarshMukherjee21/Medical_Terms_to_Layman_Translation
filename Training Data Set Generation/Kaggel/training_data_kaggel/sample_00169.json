There is a brother of 65 with hypertension. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had prostatitis with benign prostatic hypertrophy. He has some increased urinary frequency from a history of prostatitis.

Also, discussed IRC to treat bleeding and internal hemorrhoids if he is deemed to be an appropriate candidate at the time of his colonoscopy and the patient was agreeable. I am also a little concerned about his family history of esophageal cancer and his personal history of heartburn and suggested that we check him once for Barrett's esophagus. If he does not have it now then it should not be a significant risk in the future. The indications and benefits of EGD, colonoscopy, and IRC were discussed. The risks including sedation, bleeding, infection, and perforation were discussed. The importance of a good bowel prep so as to minimize missing any lesions was discussed. His questions were answered and informed consent obtained. It was a pleasure to care for this nice patient.",
