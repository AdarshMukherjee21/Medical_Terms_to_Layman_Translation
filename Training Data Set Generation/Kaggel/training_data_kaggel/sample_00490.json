  "medical": "CC: Horizontal diplopia. HX: This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia. PMH: 1)4Vessel CABG and pacemaker placement, 4/84. 2)Hypercholesterolemia. 3)Bipolar Affective D/O. FHX: HTN, Colon CA, and a daughter with unknown type of &quot;dystonia.&quot; SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. ROS: no recent weight loss/fever/chills/night sweats/CP/SOB. He occasionally experiences bilateral lower extremity cramping (?claudication) after walking for prolonged periods. MEDS: Lithium 300mg bid, Accupril 20mg bid, Cellufresh Ophthalmologic Tears, ASA 325mg qd. EXAM: BP216/108 HR72 RR14 Wt81.6kg T36.6C MS: unremarkable. CN: horizontal binocular diplopia on lateral gaze in both directions. No other CN deficits noted. Motor: 5/5 full strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: unremarkable. Coord: mild &quot;ataxia&quot; of RAM (left &gt; right) Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 symmetric throughout. Plantars (bilateral dorsiflexion) STUDIES/COURSE: Gen Screen: unremarkable. Brain CT revealed 1.0 x 1.5 cm area of calcific density within the medial two-thirds of the left cerebral peduncle. This shows no mass effect, but demonstrates mild contrast enhancement. There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma). No surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed. He was lost to follow-up in 1993.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: horizontal double vision (seeing two images side‑by‑side).\n\nHistory: A 67‑year‑old man first noticed horizontal double vision 25 years ago. It started suddenly and came and went for about a year. He was checked twice for myasthenia gravis, but doctors said he probably didn’t have it. He didn’t receive any treatment and the double vision went away on its own. He was fine until a year ago when the double vision returned suddenly. It happens every day for a few minutes at a time and disappears when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at far objects or objects to the side. No other symptoms are present.\n\nPast medical history:  \n1. Four‑vessel coronary artery bypass graft and pacemaker placed in April 1984.  \n2. High cholesterol.  \n3. Bipolar affective disorder.\n\nFamily history: high blood pressure, colon cancer, and a daughter with an unknown type of dystonia.\n\nSocial history: does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\n\nReview of systems: no recent weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, or shortness of breath. He sometimes gets cramping in both legs after walking a long time (possible claudication).\n\nMedications: lithium 300 mg twice daily, Accupril 20 mg twice daily, artificial tears, aspirin 325 mg daily.\n\nPhysical exam:  \n- Blood pressure 216/108 mm Hg, heart rate 72 bpm, respirations 14/min, weight 81.6 kg, temperature 36.6 °C.  \n- General appearance normal.  \n- Cranial nerves: horizontal double vision when looking to the side in both directions; no other nerve problems.  \n- Muscles: full strength, normal size and tone.  \n- Sensation: normal.  \n- Coordination: mild unsteady movements of the right arm (worse on the left). No drift when holding arms out or standing.  \n- Gait: normal.  \n- Reflexes: normal.  \n- Plantar responses: normal.\n\nStudies: General screening normal. Brain CT shows a 1.0 × 1.5 cm calcified spot in the left midbrain area. It does not press on other structures but shows slight contrast uptake. There are small low‑density spots in the white matter around the ventricles, likely age‑related changes from small blood vessel disease. The midbrain finding looks most like a hemangioma; a low‑grade astrocytoma could also be possible but would usually enhance less. Metastatic tumors could calcify but usually cause swelling. The long history suggests a hemangioma. No surgery or imaging follow‑up was done; the patient was just monitored. He was lost to follow‑up in 1993."
