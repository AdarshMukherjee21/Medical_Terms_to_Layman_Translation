Lower tract outlet obstructive symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy. 3. Inability to pass a Foley catheter x3. PROCEDURES: 1. Cystoscopy. 2. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). ANESTHESIA: General laryngeal mask. INDICATIONS: This patient is a 61-year-old white male who has been treated at the VA in Houston for a bladder cancer. His history dates back to 2003 when he had a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. He had multiple cystoscopies and followups since that time with no evidence of recurrence. However, on recent cystoscopy, he had what appeared to be a recurrent tumor and was taken to the operating room and had this resected with findings of a Ta grade III transitional cell carcinoma associated with carcinoma in situ. Retrograde pyelograms were suspicious on the right and cleared with ureteroscopy and the left renal pelvic washing was positive but this may represent contamination from the lower urinary tract as radiographically, there were no abnormalities. I had cystoscoped the patient in the office showed during the period of time when he had significant irritative burning symptoms, and there were still healing biopsy sites. We elected to allow his bladder to recover before starting the BCG. We were ready to do that last week but two doctors and a nurse including myself were unable to pass Foley catheter. I repeated a cystoscopy in the office with findings of a high bladder neck and BPH. After a lengthy discussion with the patient and his wife, we elected to proceed with TURP after a full informed consent. FINDINGS: At cystoscopy, there was bilobular prostatic hyperplasia and a very high riding bladder neck, which may have been the predominant cause of his difficulty catheterizing and obstructive symptoms. There were mucosal changes on the left posterior wall in the midline suspicious for carcinoma in situ. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23 French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings as described. We removed the cystoscope and passed a #28 French continuous flow resectoscope sheath under visual obturator after dilating the meatus to #32 French with van Buren sounds. Inspection of bladder again was made noting the location of the ureteral orifices relative to the bladder neck. The groove was cut at 6 o'clock to open the bladder neck to verumontanum and then the left lobe was resected from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock. Hemostasis was achieved, and then a similar procedure performed in the right side. We resected the anterior stromal tissue and the apical tissue and then obtained complete hemostasis. Chips were removed with Ellik evacuator. There was no bleeding at the conclusion of the procedure, and the resectoscope was removed. A #24 French three-way Foley catheter was placed with efflux of clear irrigant. The patient was returned to the supine position, awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",

Lower urinary tract blockage caused by an enlarged prostate.  \n3. Unable to insert a Foley catheter three times.  \n\nPROCEDURES:  \n1. Cystoscopy.  \n2. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  \n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with a laryngeal mask.  \n\nINDICATIONS:  \nThe patient is a 61‑year‑old white man who has been treated at the VA in Houston for bladder cancer. His history goes back to 2003 when he had non‑muscle invasive bladder cancer. He has had many cystoscopies and follow‑ups since then with no signs of the cancer coming back. However, a recent cystoscopy showed a possible recurrent tumor. He was taken to the operating room, the tumor was removed, and the pathology showed Ta grade III transitional cell cancer with carcinoma in situ. A retrograde pyelogram on the right side was suspicious but cleared with ureteroscopy, and the left kidney washings were positive, but this may have been contamination from the lower urinary tract because imaging showed no kidney problems. An office cystoscopy during a period when he had burning symptoms still showed healing biopsy sites. We decided to let his bladder heal before starting BCG treatment. We were ready to start BCG last week, but two doctors and a nurse, including myself, could not pass a Foley catheter. I did another office cystoscopy and found a high bladder neck and an enlarged prostate. After a long discussion with the patient and his wife, we decided to do a TURP after full informed consent.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \nDuring cystoscopy, the prostate was enlarged and the bladder neck was very high, which likely caused his difficulty with catheterization and blockage symptoms. There were mucosal changes on the left posterior wall of the bladder that looked like carcinoma in situ.  \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nThe patient was taken to the cystoscopy room and given general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask. He was positioned on his back with legs apart. The genital area was cleaned and covered. A cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23 French scope and a 70‑degree lens, showing the findings described. The scope was removed and a #28 French resectoscope sheath was inserted under vision after dilating the urethra to #32 French with van Buren sounds. The bladder was inspected again, noting the ureter openings relative to the bladder neck. The bladder neck was cut at the 6 o’clock position to open it to the verumontanum, and then the left lobe of the prostate was removed from 1 o’clock to 5 o’clock. Bleeding was stopped, and the same was done on the right side. The anterior stromal tissue and the apex were removed, and bleeding was controlled. Tissue chips were removed with an Ellik evacuator. There was no bleeding at the end of the procedure, and the resectoscope was removed. A #24 French three‑way Foley catheter was placed, and clear fluid drained out. The patient was turned back to a lying‑on‑back position, woke up, had the mask removed, and was taken to the recovery room in good condition."
