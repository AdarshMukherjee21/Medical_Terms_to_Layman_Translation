  "medical": "The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position. Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place during the procedure. After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty. The scope was advanced down the esophagus and into the body of the stomach. The scope was further advanced to the pylorus and into the duodenum. The duodenum was visualized well into its second portion and was free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration. Retroflexion view of the fundus was normal without evidence of abnormality. The scope was then slowly removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "The patient was taken to the GI lab and laid on their left side. Their pulse and blood pressure were monitored the whole time. After the patient agreed, a video scope was gently passed over the back of the tongue. It was moved down the esophagus into the stomach, then past the pylorus into the duodenum. The duodenum was seen clearly up to its second part and showed no narrowing, tumors, or ulcers. A backward view of the stomach’s upper part (fundus) looked normal. The scope was then slowly taken out. The patient handled the procedure well."
