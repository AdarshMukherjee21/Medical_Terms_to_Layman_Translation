  "medical": "INDICATION FOR STUDY: Elevated cardiac enzymes, fullness in chest, abnormal EKG, and risk factors. MEDICATIONS: Femara, verapamil, Dyazide, Hyzaar, glyburide, and metformin. BASELINE EKG: Sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute, poor anteroseptal R-wave progression, mild lateral ST abnormalities. EXERCISE RESULTS: 1. The patient exercised for 3 minutes stopping due to fatigue. No chest pain. 2. Heart rate increased from 84 to 138 or 93% of maximum predicted heart rate. Blood pressure rose from 150/88 to 210/100. There was a slight increase in her repolorization abnormalities in a non-specific pattern. NUCLEAR PROTOCOL: Same day rest/stress protocol was utilized with 11 mCi for the rest dose and 33 mCi for the stress test. NUCLEAR RESULTS: 1. Nuclear perfusion imaging, review of the raw projection data reveals adequate image acquisition. The resting images showed decreased uptake in the anterior wall. However the apex is spared of this defect. There is no significant change between rest and stress images. The sum score is 0. 2. The Gated SPECT shows moderate LVH with slightly low EF of 48%. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of exercise induced ischemia at a high myocardial workload. This essentially excludes obstructive CAD as a cause of her elevated troponin. 2. Mild hypertensive cardiomyopathy with an EF of 48%. 3. Poor exercise capacity due to cardiovascular deconditioning. 4. Suboptimally controlled blood pressure on today's exam.",
  "layman": "**Why the test was done:**  \nThe patient had high heart‑enzyme levels, a feeling of fullness in the chest, an abnormal EKG, and several risk factors for heart disease.\n\n**Medications the patient is taking:**  \nFemara, verapamil, Dyazide, Hyzaar, glyburide, and metformin.\n\n**Baseline EKG:**  \nNormal rhythm at 84 beats per minute. The EKG showed poor progression of the R‑wave in the front part of the heart and mild changes in the side part of the heart.\n\n**Exercise test results:**  \n1. The patient exercised for 3 minutes before stopping because she got tired. She did not feel chest pain.  \n2. Heart rate rose from 84 to 138 beats per minute (about 93 % of the maximum predicted for her age). Blood pressure increased from 150/88 to 210/100. There was a slight, non‑specific change in the heart’s repolarization pattern.\n\n**Nuclear imaging protocol:**  \nA same‑day rest‑and‑stress test was performed. The rest dose was 11 mCi and the stress dose was 33 mCi.\n\n**Nuclear imaging results:**  \n1. The images were taken correctly. At rest the front wall of the heart showed less tracer uptake, but the tip of the heart (apex) was normal. The rest and stress images were essentially the same, giving a total score of 0.  \n2. The gated SPECT scan showed moderate left‑ventricular hypertrophy and a slightly low ejection fraction of 48 %.\n\n**Overall impression:**  \n1. No evidence that the heart was blocked during exercise, so the high troponin is not due to blocked coronary arteries.  \n2. Mild high‑blood‑pressure heart disease with an ejection fraction of 48 %.  \n3. The patient’s poor exercise tolerance is mainly due to being out of shape.  \n4. Blood pressure was not well controlled during the exam."
