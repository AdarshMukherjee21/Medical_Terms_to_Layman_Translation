  "medical": "PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made. The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening. Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg. The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. A total of 3 other trocars were placed. The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position. The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior iliac spine. The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars. All of the trocars were placed without difficulty. The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left. The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder. A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct proximally and distally. The duct was divided between the clips. The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct. The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posterior to the cystic duct. It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally. The artery was divided between the clips. The 2 midline port sites were injected with 5% Marcaine. After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula. The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula. As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen. The neck of the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen. Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen. Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. Dressings were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. PROCEDURE: After the patient gave permission, she was taken to the operating room and laid on her back on the table. A breathing tube was inserted and general anesthesia was started without any problems. The surgeon cleaned and covered the area in the usual sterile way. A 2‑centimeter cut was made just below the belly button. The outer layer of the belly was cleared of fat with a clamp. A small 1‑2‑centimeter cut was then made in that layer, allowing the surgeon to enter the belly cavity safely. Two stitches of 0 Vicryl were placed in the outer layer above and below the cut and tied to a special 12‑mm tube that keeps the opening closed. Carbon dioxide gas was pumped into the belly to create space, keeping the pressure at 16 mmHg. The other tubes were then inserted while the surgeon watched with a 30‑degree camera, making sure the cuts followed natural skin lines, spreading the fat with a clamp, and checking the entry point by pressing on the belly wall before putting the tubes in. Three more tubes were placed: a 10/11‑mm tube in the upper middle line, a 5‑mm tube near the front of the hip bone, and a 5‑mm tube halfway between the two. All tubes were inserted without difficulty. The patient was then tilted slightly upward and turned a little to the left. The gallbladder was grabbed through the second and third tubes and pulled up toward the right shoulder. A laparoscopic dissector was inserted through the upper tube, and the surgeon carefully cut the tissues around the gallbladder’s blood vessels and ducts. A clip tool was used through the upper tube to place two clips on the cystic duct, one near the gallbladder and one farther away. The duct was cut between the clips, making sure the clip did not touch the main bile duct. The cystic artery was found near the duct, and it was carefully freed from surrounding tissue. The clip tool was used again to place two clips on the artery, one near the gallbladder and one farther away, and the artery was cut between the clips. The two middle tubes were given a local anesthetic (5% Marcaine). After the gallbladder was completely detached from the liver, the camera was removed and re‑inserted through the upper 10/11‑mm tube. A large forceps was used through the belly‑button tube to grab the gallbladder’s neck. As the gallbladder was pulled out through the belly‑button opening, the forceps and the tube were removed from the belly. The gallbladder’s neck was taken out of the belly. After the gallbladder was removed, the remaining gas was released. The two middle openings in the outer layer were stitched together with 0 Vicryl. All skin cuts were closed with 4‑0 Vicryl stitches in a smooth, inside‑out fashion. The skin was cleaned with benzoin, and Steri‑Strips were applied. Dressings were put on. All instruments and sponges were counted correctly. The patient tolerated the surgery well, was taken off the breathing tube, and went to the recovery room in good, stable condition."
