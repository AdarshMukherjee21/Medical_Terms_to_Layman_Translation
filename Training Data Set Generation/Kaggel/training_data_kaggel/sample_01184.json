  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female with two month history of low back pain and leg pain. FINDINGS: Axial scans were performed from L1 to S2 and reformatted images were obtained in the sagittal and coronal planes. Preliminary scout film demonstrates anterior end plate spondylosis at T11-12 and T12-L1. L1-2: There is normal disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, very minimal vacuum change with no posterior annular disc bulging or protrusion. Normal central canal, intervertebral neural foramina and facet joints (image #4). L2-3: There is mild decreased disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, circumferential disc protrusion measuring 4.6mm (AP) and right extraforaminal osteophyte disc complex. There is mild non-compressive right neural foraminal narrowing, minimal facet arthrosis, normal central canal and left neural foramen (image #13). L3-4: There is normal disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, and circumferential non-compressive annular disc bulging. The disc bulging flattens the ventral thecal sac and there is minimal non-compressive right neural foraminal narrowing, minimal to mild facet arthrosis with vacuum change on the right, normal central canal and left neural foramen (image #25). L4-5: There is normal disc height, minimal anterior end plate spondylosis, and posterior non-compressive annular disc bulging. There is minimal narrowing of the lateral recesses of L5, mild to moderate facet arthrosis greater on the right, normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina (image #35). L5-S1: There is severe loss of disc height with vacuum change, spondylolisthesis with 6.9mm of anterolisthesis of L5 with no disc protrusion. There is mild to moderate neural foraminal stenosis with possible neural impingement greater on the right with elongation of the neural foramina, mild facet arthrosis, and moderate degenerative change at the level of the pars interarticularis defect. Normal central canal (image #39, 40, 42). There is no significant degenerative change at the SI joints. There is moderate arteriosclerotic calcifications in the abdominal aorta and proximal common iliac arteries. IMPRESSION: T11-12, T12-L1 anterior end plate spondylosis. L1-2 anterior end plate spondylosis, and very minimal vacuum change within the disc space. L2-3 loss of disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, circumferential disc protrusion, right extraforaminal osteophyte disc complex, non-displaced right neural foraminal narrowing, and facet arthrosis. L3-4 anterior end plate spondylosis, circumferential non-compressive annular disc bulging, facet arthrosis, with vacuum change on the right and non-compressive right neural foraminal narrowing. L4-5 anterior end plate spondylosis, posterior annular disc bulging, facet arthrosis and narrowing of the lateral recesses of L5. L5-S1 Grade I spondylolisthesis, advanced degenerative disc disease with vacuum change, neural foraminal stenosis possibly impinging exiting L5 nerve roots, degenerative change at the level of the pars interarticularis defect and facet joints. Arteriosclerotic vascular calcifications.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged woman who has had lower back pain and leg pain for about two months.  \n\n**Findings**  \nMRI scans were taken from the upper part of the lower spine (L1) down to the top of the pelvis (S2). The images were shown in side‑view (sagittal) and front‑to‑back (coronal) views.  \n\n- **Upper spine (T11‑12 and T12‑L1)**: The front parts of the vertebrae show early wear (spondylosis).  \n- **L1‑2**: The disc height is normal. The front part of the vertebra shows mild wear, and there is a very small gas pocket in the disc, but no bulging or herniation. The spinal canal, the openings for nerves, and the joint spaces are normal.  \n- **L2‑3**: The disc height is slightly reduced. The front part of the vertebra shows wear. The disc bulges all around, measuring 4.6 mm from front to back, and there is a small bony growth (osteophyte) on the right side outside the nerve opening. The right nerve opening is slightly narrowed but not compressed. The joint on the right side shows mild wear. The canal and the left nerve opening are normal.  \n- **L3‑4**: Disc height is normal. The front part of the vertebra shows wear. The disc bulges all around but does not compress the canal. The bulge flattens the front of the spinal cord. The right nerve opening is slightly narrowed, and the right joint shows mild wear and a small gas pocket. The canal and left nerve opening are normal.  \n- **L4‑5**: Disc height is normal. The front part of the vertebra shows minimal wear. The disc bulges on the back side but does not compress the canal. The spaces where the nerves exit on the right side are slightly narrowed. The right joint shows mild to moderate wear. The canal and the openings for nerves are normal.  \n- **L5‑S1**: The disc height is severely reduced and there is a gas pocket. The lower vertebra (L5) slips forward 6.9 mm (spondylolisthesis) but the disc is not herniated. The nerve openings on the right side are moderately narrowed and may press on the exiting nerve roots. The right joint shows mild wear. There is moderate wear at the bony bridge (pars interarticularis) that connects the upper and lower parts of the vertebra. The spinal canal is normal.  \n- The joints where the spine meets the pelvis (SI joints) show no major wear.  \n- There are moderate calcium deposits in the abdominal aorta and the nearby iliac arteries (arteriosclerosis).  \n\n**Impression**  \n- Wear of the front parts of the upper thoracic and lower thoracic vertebrae (T11‑12, T12‑L1).  \n- L1‑2: front vertebra wear and a very small gas pocket in the disc.  \n- L2‑3: disc height loss, front vertebra wear, disc bulging all around, a bony growth on the right, mild narrowing of the right nerve opening, and mild joint wear.  \n- L3‑4: front vertebra wear, disc bulging all around, mild joint wear, a gas pocket on the right, and mild narrowing of the right nerve opening.  \n- L4‑5: front vertebra wear, back disc bulging, mild to moderate joint wear, and slight narrowing of the right nerve recess.  \n- L5‑S1: Grade I forward slip of L5, advanced disc wear with a gas pocket, moderate narrowing of the nerve openings that may press on the L5 nerve roots, wear at the bony bridge, and joint wear.  \n- Calcium deposits in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries."
