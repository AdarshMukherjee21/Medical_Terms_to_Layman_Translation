  "medical": "EXAM: Screening full-field digital mammogram. HISTORY: Screening examination of a 58-year-old female who currently denies complaints. Patient has had diagnosis of right breast cancer in 1984 with subsequent radiation therapy. The patient's sister was also diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 59. TECHNIQUE: Standard digital mammographic imaging was performed. The examination was performed with iCAD Second Look Version 7.2. COMPARISON: Most recently obtained __________. FINDINGS: The right breast is again smaller than the left. There is a scar marker with underlying skin thickening and retraction along the upper margin of the right breast. The breasts are again composed of a mixture of adipose tissue and a moderate amount of heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue. There is again some coarsening of the right breast parenchyma with architectural distortion which is unchanged and most consistent with postsurgical and postradiation changes. A few benign-appearing microcalcifications are present. No dominant malignant-appearing mass lesion, developing area of architectural distortion or suspicious-appearing cluster of microcalcifications are identified. The skin is stable. No enlarged axillary lymph node is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. No significant interval changes are seen. No mammographic evidence of malignancy is identified. 2. Annual screening mammography is recommended or sooner if clinical symptoms warrant. BIRADS Classification 2 - Benign MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION: 1. A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography. 2. Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present. 3. These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2 was utilized.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Full‑field digital mammogram for screening.  \nHISTORY: A 58‑year‑old woman had a routine screening mammogram. She reports no current symptoms. She was diagnosed with right‑breast cancer in 1984 and received radiation therapy. Her sister was also diagnosed with breast cancer at age 59.  \nTECHNIQUE: Standard digital mammography was performed using iCAD Second Look Version 7.2.  \nCOMPARISON: The most recent previous study was __________.  \nFINDINGS: The right breast is still smaller than the left. A scar marker is visible, with some thickening and pulling of the skin along the upper edge of the right breast. Both breasts contain a mix of fatty tissue and a moderate amount of dense glandular tissue. The right breast shows some coarse changes and distortion that are unchanged from before, consistent with the effects of surgery and radiation. A few small, benign‑looking calcifications are seen. No large mass, new distortion, or suspicious cluster of calcifications are found. The skin looks stable. No enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the armpit.  \nIMPRESSION: 1. No new or significant changes. No signs of cancer on the mammogram. 2. Annual screening mammograms are recommended, or sooner if symptoms appear.  \nBIRADS Classification: 2 – Benign.  \nMAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION: 1. About 10% to 15% of cancers may not be seen on a mammogram. 2. If a suspicious lump is felt, a biopsy should still be considered even if the mammogram looks normal. 3. The images were taken with FDA‑approved digital mammography equipment and analyzed with iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2."
