  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATION PERFORMED: Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 450 mL. REPLACEMENT: 250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS OF SURGERY: This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate. Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy. Potential complications include, but are not limited to: 1. Infection. 2. Bleeding. 3. Incontinence. 4. Impotence. 5. Injury to the adjacent viscera. 6. Deep venous thrombosis. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room. Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty. The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade. The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie. Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly. A Bookwalter retractor was then placed. The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected. Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy. The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors. Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection. Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device. The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion. With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie. Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra could then be easily identified. Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors. This exposed the blue Foley catheter. Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture. Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly. The Foley catheter was then removed. This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally. Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally. This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate. Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat. The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat. The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate. Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved. The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps. The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only. Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time. The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized. The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side. The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method. Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy. Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles. This was developed without any difficulty. Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected. The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis. About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed. The tip was left behind. Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected. This was performed on the left side and then the right side. This completely freed the prostate. The prostate was sent for permanent section. The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature. The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures. The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck. This was performed by using a French ***** needle. A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down. A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon. The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty. A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region. All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure. The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**  \nProstate cancer.  \n\n**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**  \nProstate cancer.  \n\n**OPERATION PERFORMED**  \nRadical retropubic prostatectomy that tried to keep the nerves intact, with no removal of lymph nodes.  \n\n**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**  \n450 mL.  \n\n**REPLACEMENT**  \n250 mL of blood collected by a Cell Saver and crystalloid fluid.  \n\n**COMPLICATIONS**  \nNone.  \n\n---\n\n### INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY  \nA 67‑year‑old man had a needle biopsy that found a single low‑grade (Gleason 6) cancer spot on the right side of his prostate. He is otherwise healthy and chose surgery to remove the prostate. Possible complications include:  \n1. Infection  \n2. Bleeding  \n3. Incontinence  \n4. Impotence  \n5. Injury to nearby organs  \n6. Blood clots  \n\n---\n\n### PROCEDURE IN DETAIL  \n\n1. **Preparation** – A pre‑operative antibiotic was given. The patient was taken to the operating room, given epidural and general anesthesia, and the surgical area was cleaned and covered.  \n\n2. **Catheter and incision** – A 16‑French Foley catheter was inserted and clear urine drained. A midline cut below the belly button was made with a #10 scalpel blade.  \n\n3. **Opening the layers** – The rectus fascia and the skin‑under‑fat layer were opened with a cautery device (Bovie). The transversalis fascia was cut in the middle, and the space behind the bladder and around the prostate was opened bluntly. A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  \n\n4. **Checking lymph nodes** – The area where lymph nodes might be was inspected; none were suspicious, so no lymph node removal was done.  \n\n5. **Fascia and veins** – The fascia around the pelvic organs was cut on both sides with Metzenbaum scissors. Small veins that ran from the prostate to the side walls were sealed with a bipolar coagulation device.  \n\n6. **Prostate and dorsal vein** – The back part of the prostate was pulled together with 2‑0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was tied off with 0 Vicryl in a figure‑of‑eight and then cut. With the prostate lifted upward, the dorsal vein was first cut with the cautery and then deeper with scissors.  \n\n7. **Urethra** – The urethra was found and opened. About two‑thirds of the urethra from front to back was cut with scissors, exposing the Foley catheter. Six evenly spaced stitches (2‑0 Monocryl) were placed on the urethral stump. The catheter was removed to allow better pulling of the prostate.  \n\n8. **Nerve‑bundle release** – The side fascia was opened on both sides, freeing the nerve‑vascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate. Dissection continued into the fat around the rectum, and the prostate was removed from the sides to the center.  \n\n9. **Ureter and bladder** – The floor behind the prostate and the rectourethralis muscle were cut just below the prostate. The ureteral stump was kept as long as possible. The prostate was lifted upward with fine forceps and dissected off the surrounding fat using only sharp cuts. No traction was applied to the nerve bundle.  \n\n10. **Seminal vesicles and vas deferens** – The prostate pedicles were clipped with multiple medium clips in 4–5 small bundles on each side. The bladder neck was cut out, but most of its tissue could not be kept because of the patient’s anatomy. After separating the prostate from the bladder, a plane was made between the bladder and the seminal vesicles. Both vas deferens were found, clipped, and cut. The seminal vesicles were large; about two‑thirds were removed, leaving the deep tip behind. A bipolar Gyrus device was used to clamp, cauterize, and cut the remaining tip on both sides.  \n\n11. **Pathology** – The prostate was sent for permanent section.  \n\n12. **Bladder‑urethra connection** – The opening in the bladder neck was closed with two 2‑0 Vicryl stitches. The bladder neck lining was turned outward with 4‑0 chromic stitches. Small bleeding around the back of the bladder was stopped with a suture ligature. The ureter opening was clearly seen and was not affected by the stitches. The anastomotic stitch on the urethral stump was placed on the matching spot on the bladder neck using a French needle. A 20‑French Foley catheter was inserted, the stitches were tied in order, and the catheter balloon was inflated with 15 mL of sterile water. The bladder was connected to the urethra without difficulty.  \n\n13. **Drain and closure** – A 19‑French Blake drain was placed in the left pelvis and exited through the right groin. All instruments, sponges, and latex were counted twice before closing. The rectus fascia was closed in a running fashion with #1 PDS. The skin‑under‑fat layer was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl stitches. The skin was closed with metal staples.  \n\n14. **Recovery** – The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
