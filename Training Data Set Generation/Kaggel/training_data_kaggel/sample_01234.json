  "medical": "REFERRING DIAGNOSIS: Motor neuron disease. PERTINENT HISTORY AND EXAMINATION: Briefly, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of progression of dysphagia for the past year, dysarthria, weakness of her right arm, cramps in her legs, and now with progressive weakness in her upper extremities. SUMMARY: The right median sensory response showed a borderline normal amplitude for age with mild slowing of conduction velocity. The right ulnar sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. The right radial sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. The right sural and left sural sensory responses were absent. The right median motor response showed a prolonged distal latency across the wrist, with proximal slowing. The distal amplitude was very reduced, and there was a reduction with proximal stimulation. The right ulnar motor amplitude was borderline normal, with slowing of the conduction velocity across the elbow. The right common peroneal motor response showed a decreased amplitude when recorded from the EDB, with mild slowing of the proximal conduction velocity across the knee. The right tibial motor response showed a reduced amplitude with prolongation of the distal latency. The left common peroneal response recorded from the EDB showed a decreased amplitude with mild distal slowing. The left tibial motor response showed a decreased amplitude with a borderline normal distal latency. The minimum F-wave latencies were normal with the exception of a mild prolongation of the ulnar F-wave latency, and the tibial F-wave latency as indicated above. With repetitive nerve stimulation, there was no significant decrement noted in either the right nasalis or the right trapezius muscles. Concentric needle EMG studies were performed in the right lower extremity, right upper extremity, thoracic paraspinals, and in the tongue. There was evidence of increased insertional activity in the right tibialis anterior muscle, with evidence of fasciculations noted in several lower and upper extremity muscles and in the tongue. In addition, there was evidence of increased amplitude, long duration and polyphasic motor units with a decreased recruitment noted in most muscles tested as indicated in the table above. INTERPRETATION: Abnormal electrodiagnostic study. There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a disorder of the anterior motor neurons affecting at least four segments. There is also evidence of a more generalized neuropathy that seems to be present in both the upper and lower extremities. There is also evidence of a right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Even despite the patient's age, the decrease in sensory responses is concerning, and makes it difficult to be certain about the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. However, the overall changes on the needle EMG would be consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease. The patient will return for further evaluation.",
  "layman": "**Referring diagnosis:** Motor neuron disease.\n\n**History and exam:**  \nThe patient is an 83‑year‑old woman who has had trouble swallowing for the past year, slurred speech, weakness in her right arm, leg cramps, and now worsening weakness in her upper limbs.\n\n**Summary of test results:**  \n- **Right median nerve (sensory):** The signal was just within normal limits for her age but moved a little slower.  \n- **Right ulnar and radial nerves (sensory):** Signals were weaker and slower.  \n- **Sural nerves (sensory):** No signals were detected on either side.  \n- **Right median nerve (motor):** The signal took longer to reach the wrist and was very weak, especially when the nerve was stimulated farther up the arm.  \n- **Right ulnar nerve (motor):** Signal was almost normal but slowed across the elbow.  \n- **Right common peroneal nerve (motor):** Signal to the EDB muscle was weaker and a bit slower across the knee.  \n- **Right tibial nerve (motor):** Signal was weaker and took longer to reach the foot.  \n- **Left common peroneal nerve (motor):** Weaker signal with a little slower distance.  \n- **Left tibial nerve (motor):** Weaker signal but timing was almost normal.  \n- **F‑waves (a test of nerve speed):** Mostly normal, except the ulnar and tibial nerves were a little slower.  \n- **Repetitive nerve stimulation:** No drop in signal strength in the right nasalis or trapezius muscles.  \n\n**Needle EMG (muscle test):**  \n- In the right tibialis anterior muscle, the signal when the muscle was first activated was higher than normal.  \n- Several muscles in the legs, arms, back, and tongue showed small spontaneous twitches (fasciculations).  \n- Most muscles had larger, longer, and more complex signals, but fewer signals appeared when the muscles were activated.\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nThe electrical tests show problems with the front motor neurons in at least four spinal segments. There is also a widespread nerve problem affecting both arms and legs. Additionally, there is a right median nerve issue at the wrist and a right ulnar nerve issue at the elbow. The reduced sensory signals are concerning, especially for someone of her age, and make it hard to be certain about a motor neuron disease diagnosis. However, the needle EMG findings are consistent with motor neuron disease. The patient will return for further evaluation."
