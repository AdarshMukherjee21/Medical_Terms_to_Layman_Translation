  "medical": "ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: 1. Hematuria. 2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. 3. Osteoarthritis. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hematuria, resolved. 2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. 3. Complex renal cyst versus renal cell carcinoma or other tumor. 4. Osteoarthritis. HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 77-year-old African-American male who was previously well until he began having gross hematuria and clots passing through his urethra on the day of admission. He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended. He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge. He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d. DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING: The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week. The patient is to return to the emergency room or to our clinic if he has worsening hematuria again or no urine output.",

Joint wear and tear (osteoarthritis).\n\n**Discharge diagnoses:**  \n1. Blood in the urine – now resolved.  \n2. Enlarged prostate.  \n3. A kidney cyst that may be a complex cyst or a kidney tumor.  \n4. Osteoarthritis.\n\n**Hospital course:**  \nA 77‑year‑old African‑American man who had been healthy until he started passing large blood clots in his urine on the day he was admitted. He had never had blood in his urine before, but he has a history of an enlarged prostate and had surgery to remove part of his prostate more than ten years ago.\n\nHe was admitted to a regular hospital bed. A urologist (Dr. G) was consulted to look at the blood in his urine. He had a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast, including early and late images of the kidneys and urinary tract. The scan showed many cysts in both kidneys, one of which did not look like a simple cyst, so an ultrasound was recommended.\n\nThe ultrasound found a 2.1 × 2.7 cm mass on the right kidney that also did not look like a simple cyst. The doctors said it could be a bleeding cyst, a solid mass, or a tumor, so they scheduled an MRI for the day he was discharged. The MRI report was not ready when he left the hospital.\n\nHe also had a cystoscopy and a complete removal of his prostate gland (transurethral resection of the prostate). The pathology showed mostly fibrous and muscle tissue, confirming non‑prostatic hyperplasia. His urine cleared slowly. He could eat a regular diet and did his daily activities without trouble. The catheter was removed on the day he was discharged.\n\nAfter the prostate surgery he was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix for a short time. He is told to keep taking Colace as an outpatient to keep his stool soft and comfortable.\n\n**Discharge medications:**  \nColace 100 mg, twice a day.\n\n**Follow‑up planning:**  \nHe should see his primary care doctor (Dr. B or Dr. J at ABCD) in the next couple of weeks. He will also call Dr. G, the urologist, within a week to discuss the MRI results and plans for a possible laparoscopic kidney biopsy. That procedure is scheduled for the week after he leaves the hospital, and he will confirm the exact date later this week. If he has more blood in his urine again or stops producing urine, he should go to the emergency room or the clinic."
