  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal aortic aneurysm. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal aortic aneurysm. OPERATION PERFORMED: Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. FINDINGS: The patient was brought to the OR with the known 4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm + 2.5 cm right common iliac artery aneurysm. A Gore exclusive device was used 3 pieces were used to effect the repair. We had to place an iliac extender down in to right external iliac artery to manage the right common iliac artery aneurysm. The right hypogastric artery had been previously coiled off. Left common femoral artery was used for the _____ side. We had small type 2 leak right underneath the take off the renal arteries, this was not felt to be type I leak and this was very delayed filling and it was felt that this was highly indicative of type 2 leak from a lumbar artery, which commonly come off in this area. It was felt that this would seal after reversal of the anticoagulation given sufficient time. PROCEDURE: With the patient supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Bilateral groin incisions were made, and the common femoral arteries were dissected out bilaterally. The patient was then heparinized. The 7-French sheaths were then placed retrograde bilaterally. A stiff Amplatz wires were then placed up the right femoral artery and a stiff Amplatz were placed left side a calibrated catheter was placed up the right side. The calibrated aortogram was the done. We marked the renal arteries aortic bifurcation and bifurcation, common iliac arteries. We then preceded placement of the main trunk, by replacing the 7 French sheath in the left groin area with 18-french sheath and then deployed the trunk body just below the take off renal arteries. Once the main trunk has been deployed within wired _____ then deployed an iliac limb down in to the right common iliac artery. As noted above, we then had to place an iliac extension, down in the external iliac artery to exclude the right common iliac artery and resume completely. Following completion of the above all arteries were ballooned appropriately. A completion angiogram was done which showed late small type 2 leak just under the take off renal arteries. The area was ballooned aggressively. It was felt that this would dissolve as discussed above. Following completion of the above all wire sheaths etc., were removed from both groin areas. Both femoral arteries were repaired by primary suture technique. Flow was then reestablished to the lower extremities, and protamine was given to reverse the heparin. Both surgical sites were then irrigated thoroughly. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved. Both wounds were then closed in a routine layered fashion. Sterile antibiotic dressings were applied. Sponge and needle counts were reported as correct. The patient tolerated the procedure well the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Abdominal aortic aneurysm.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Abdominal aortic aneurysm.  \n**Operation performed:** Endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n**Findings:**  \nThe patient had a known 4 cm aneurysm in the abdominal aorta and a 2.5 cm aneurysm in the right common iliac artery. Three Gore Excluder stent‑grafts were used to repair the aorta. Because the right common iliac aneurysm was large, we added an iliac extender that went into the right external iliac artery. The right hypogastric artery had already been blocked with coils. The left common femoral artery was used for the left side of the repair. After the main graft was placed, we saw a small, delayed leak just below the renal arteries. This was not a type I leak; it looked like a type II leak from a lumbar artery, which often supplies that area. We expected the leak to seal after we stopped the blood‑thinning medication and gave enough time.\n\n**Procedure:**  \nThe patient lay on his back and received general anesthesia. The abdomen and legs were cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Small incisions were made in both groins, and the common femoral arteries were exposed. Heparin was given to thin the blood. 7‑French sheaths were inserted from each groin. Stiff wires were advanced up the right femoral artery and a calibrated catheter was placed up the right side. An aortogram was performed, marking the renal arteries, the aortic bifurcation, and the common iliac arteries.  \n\nThe main graft was then placed. The 7‑French sheath in the left groin was replaced with an 18‑French sheath, and the main body of the graft was deployed just below the renal arteries. After the main trunk was secured, an iliac limb was placed into the right common iliac artery. Because of the right common iliac aneurysm, an iliac extension was added that went into the external iliac artery to fully exclude the aneurysm. All grafts were ballooned to ensure a good seal. A final angiogram showed a small, delayed type II leak below the renal arteries, which was aggressively ballooned. We expected this leak to resolve as described earlier.\n\nAfter the grafts were finished, the sheaths and wires were removed from both groins. The femoral arteries were closed with sutures. Blood flow to the legs was restored, and protamine was given to reverse the heparin. Both surgical sites were washed thoroughly, and bleeding was stopped carefully. The wounds were closed in layers, and sterile antibiotic dressings were applied. The sponge and needle counts were correct. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in good condition."
