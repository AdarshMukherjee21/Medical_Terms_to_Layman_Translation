  "medical": "INDICATIONS: Chest pain. PROCEDURE DONE: Graded exercise treadmill stress test. STRESS ECG RESULTS: The patient was stressed by continuous graded treadmill testing for nine minutes of the standard Bruce protocol. The heart rate increased from 68 beats per minute to 178 beats per minute, which is 100% of the maximum predicted target heart rate. The blood pressure increased from 120/70 to 130/80. The baseline resting electrocardiogram reveals a regular sinus rhythm. The tracing is within normal limits. Symptoms of chest pain occurred with exercise. The pain persisted during the recovery process and was aggravated by deep inspiration. Marked chest wall tenderness noted. There were no ischemic ST segment changes seen during exercise or during the recovery process. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Stress test is negative for ischemia. 2. Chest wall tenderness occurred with exercise. 3. Blood pressure response to exercise is normal.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the test:** Chest pain.  \n\n**What was done:** A treadmill stress test with gradually increasing speed and incline (Bruce protocol) for nine minutes.  \n\n**Results:**  \n- Heart rate rose from 68 to 178 beats per minute, reaching the expected maximum.  \n- Blood pressure went from 120/70 to 130/80.  \n- At rest, the ECG showed a normal, regular heart rhythm.  \n- Chest pain started while walking on the treadmill and continued after stopping, getting worse when taking a deep breath.  \n- The chest wall felt tender.  \n- No abnormal changes were seen in the ECG during or after exercise.  \n\n**Conclusions:**  \n1. The test did not show heart ischemia.  \n2. The chest pain was due to chest wall tenderness.  \n3. The blood pressure response to exercise was normal."
