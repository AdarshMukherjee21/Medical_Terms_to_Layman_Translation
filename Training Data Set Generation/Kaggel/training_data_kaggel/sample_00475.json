OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic hand-assisted left adrenalectomy and umbilical hernia repair. ANESTHESIA: General. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 52-year-old inmate with a 5.5 cm diameter nonfunctioning mass in his right adrenal. Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required. Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: In the right flank-up position, table was flexed. He had a Foley catheter in place. Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter. The umbilical hernia was taken down. An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin. A liver retractor was placed to this. The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt. The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly. The vena cava was identified. The main renal vein was identified. Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided. Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie. The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally. Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided. Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact. Hemostasis was excellent. The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down. The edges were freshened up. Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar. Skin closed with clips. He tolerated the procedure well. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss less than 100 mL. The patient was awakened, extubated, and returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition.",

Umbilical hernia.  \n\nOPERATION PERFORMED  \nLaparoscopic hand‑assisted removal of the left adrenal gland and repair of the umbilical hernia.  \n\nANESTHESIA  \nGeneral anesthesia.  \n\nCLINICAL NOTE  \nThe patient is a 52‑year‑old inmate who has a 5.5‑cm non‑functioning mass on his right adrenal gland. The surgeon explained the surgery and the risks, including infection, bleeding, the need for a blood transfusion, and the possibility that more treatment might be needed later. Alternatives were a fully laparoscopic approach, open surgery, or simply monitoring the mass.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION  \nThe patient was positioned on his right side with the operating table bent. A urinary catheter was already in place. The surgeon made a 5.5‑cm incision just above the belly button. The umbilical hernia was repaired. An 11‑mm port was inserted in the middle of the abdomen above a GelPort, and a 5‑mm port was placed on the side below the rib line. A liver retractor was used. The colon was moved to the middle by cutting the white line of Toldt. The liver’s attachments to the adrenal gland and kidney were cut and the liver was lifted upward. The vena cava and the main renal vein were located. Small vessels near the vena cava were clipped and cut. The tumor was freed from the top of the kidney using clips, a Bovie cautery, and a harmonic scalpel. The back attachments were cut with clips. Once the adrenal gland was free, its vein and a large artery were doubly clipped and cut. The gland was placed in a bag and removed whole. Bleeding was well controlled. The umbilical hernia was fully repaired, and the edges were cleaned. The incision was closed with Vicryl #1 sutures, the fascia of the port was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with clips. The patient tolerated the surgery well. All sponges and instruments were accounted for. Blood loss was less than 100 mL. The patient woke up, was taken off the breathing tube, and went to the recovery room in good condition."
