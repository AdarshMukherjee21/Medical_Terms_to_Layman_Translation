  "medical": "CC: Confusion. HX: A 71 y/o RHM ,with a history of two strokes ( one in 11/90 and one in 11/91), had been in a stable state of health until 12/31/92 when he became confused, and displayed left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. The symptoms resolved within hours and recurred the following day. He was then evaluated locally and HCT revealed an old right parietal stroke. Carotid duplex scan revealed a &quot;high grade stenosis&quot; of the RICA. Cerebral Angiogram revealed 90%RICA and 50%LICA stenosis. He was then transferred to UIHC Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy. His confusion persisted and he was evaluated by Neurology on 1/8/93 and transferred to Neurology on 1/11/93. PMH: 1)cholecystectomy. 2)inguinal herniorrhaphies, bilaterally. 3)ETOH abuse: 3-10 beers/day. 4)Right parietal stroke 10/87 with residual left hemiparesis (Leg worse than arm). 5) 2nd stoke in distant past of unspecified type. MEDS: None on admission. FHX: Alzheimer's disease and stroke on paternal side of family. SHX: 50+pack-yr cigarette use. ROS: no weight loss. poor appetite/selective eater. EXAM: BP137/70 HR81 RR13 O2Sat 95% Afebrile. MS: Oriented to city and month, but did not know date or hospital. Naming and verbal comprehension were intact. He could tell which direction Iowa City and Des Moines were from Clinton and remembered 2-3 objects in two minutes, but both with assistance only. Incorrectly spelled &quot;world&quot; backward, as &quot;dlow.&quot; CN: unremarkable except neglects left visual field to double simultaneous stimulation. Motor: Deltoids 4+/4-, biceps 5-/4, triceps 5/4+, grip 4+/4+, HF4+/4-, HE 4+/4+, Hamstrings 5-/5-, AE 5-/5-, AF 5-/5-. Sensory: intact PP/LT/Vib. Coord: dysdiadochokinesis on RAM, bilaterally. Station: dyssynergic RUE on FNF movement. Gait: ND Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout BUE and at patellae. Absent at ankles. Right plantar was flexor; and Left plantar was equivocal. COURSE: CBC revealed normal Hgb, Hct, Plt and WBC, but Mean corpuscular volume was large at 103FL (normal 82-98). Urinalysis revealed 20+WBC. GS, TSH, FT4, VDRL, ANA and RF were unremarkable. He was treated for a UTI with amoxacillin. Vitamin B12 level was reduced at 139pg/ml (normal 232-1137). Schillings test was inconclusive dure to inability to complete a 24-hour urine collection. He was placed on empiric Vitamin B12 1000mcg IM qd x 7 days; then qMonth. He was also placed on Thiamine 100mg qd, Folate 1mg qd, and ASA 325mg qd. His ESR and CRP were elevated on admission, but fell as his UTI was treated. EEG showed diffuse slowing and focal slowing in the theta-delta range in the right temporal area. HCT with contrast on 1/19/93 revealed a gyriform enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe consistent with a new infarct; and an old right parietal hypodensity (infarct). His confusion was ascribed to the UTI in the face of old and new strokes and Vitamin B12 deficiency. He was lost to follow-up and did not undergo carotid endarterectomy.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint**  \nThe patient was brought in because he was confused.\n\n**History of present illness**  \nA 71‑year‑old man who had had two strokes (one in November 1990 and another in November 1991) was doing well until December 31 1992. On that day he suddenly became confused, had weakness on the left side of his body, and had trouble speaking. The symptoms went away after a few hours but came back the next day. He was examined locally, and a CT scan of the brain showed an old stroke in the right parietal area. A carotid duplex ultrasound found a severe narrowing of the right internal carotid artery. A cerebral angiogram confirmed 90 % narrowing of the right internal carotid artery and 50 % narrowing of the left internal carotid artery. He was sent to the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics for a carotid endarterectomy, but his confusion did not improve. Neurology evaluated him on January 8 1993 and he was transferred to the neurology service on January 11 1993.\n\n**Past medical history**  \n1. Gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy).  \n2. Bilateral inguinal hernia repairs.  \n3. Alcohol abuse – 3 to 10 beers per day.  \n4. Right parietal stroke in October 1987 with lasting weakness on the left side (leg worse than arm).  \n5. A second, unspecified stroke in the distant past.\n\n**Medications on admission**  \nNone.\n\n**Family history**  \nFather’s side of the family had Alzheimer’s disease and strokes.\n\n**Social history**  \nSmoked more than 50 pack‑years.\n\n**Review of systems**  \nNo weight loss. Poor appetite and selective eating.\n\n**Physical examination**  \n- Blood pressure 137/70 mm Hg, heart rate 81 bpm, respiratory rate 13/min, oxygen saturation 95 %, no fever.  \n- Mental status: He knew the city and month but did not know the date or the hospital name. He could name and understand words. He could point out the direction of Iowa City and Des Moines from Clinton and could remember 2–3 objects in two minutes, but only with help. He spelled “world” backward incorrectly as “dlow.”  \n- Cranial nerves: normal except he ignored the left side of his visual field when both eyes were stimulated.  \n- Motor strength (graded 0–5):  \n  * Deltoids 4+/4-  \n  * Biceps 5-/4  \n  * Triceps 5/4+  \n  * Grip 4+/4+  \n  * Hand flexors 4+/4-  \n  * Hand extensors 4+/4+  \n  * Hamstrings 5-/5-  \n  * Anterior tibialis 5-/5-  \n  * Flexor hallucis 5-/5-  \n  * Flexor digitorum 5-/5-  \n- Sensation: normal touch, pain, and vibration.  \n- Coordination: difficulty with rapid alternating movements of the hands on both sides.  \n- Balance: difficulty moving the right arm and forearm together.  \n- Gait: not described.  \n- Reflexes: 2+/2+ in all upper limbs and at the knees; absent at the ankles. Right foot plantar reflex flexed; left foot reflex unclear.\n\n**Course and investigations**  \n- Complete blood count: normal hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, and white cells; mean corpuscular volume high at 103 fL (normal 82–98 fL).  \n- Urine test: 20+ white blood cells.  \n- Other labs (glucose, TSH, free T4, VDRL, ANA, RF) were normal.  \n- He was treated for a urinary tract infection with amoxicillin.  \n- Vitamin B12 level low at 139 pg/mL (normal 232–1137 pg/mL).  \n- A 24‑hour urine collection for the Schilling test could not be completed.  \n- He received vitamin B12 injections (1000 µg intramuscularly once daily for 7 days, then monthly).  \n- He also received thiamine 100 mg daily, folate 1 mg daily, and aspirin 325 mg daily.  \n- Inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) were high on admission but fell after the UTI was treated.  \n- EEG showed general slowing and focal slowing in the right temporal area.  \n- A contrast CT scan on January 19 1993 showed a new small stroke in the left parietal lobe and the old right parietal stroke.\n\n**Outcome**  \nThe confusion was attributed to the urinary tract infection, the combination of old and new strokes, and the low vitamin B12 level. He was lost to follow‑up and did not receive the planned carotid endarterectomy."
