  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005. At that time, she did not notice any specific injury. Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain. At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf. Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle. Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time. Relieved by standing and lying down. She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness. No change in bowel or bladder function. Symptoms have slowly progressed. She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective. She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day. This was done four and a half weeks ago. On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric. Straight leg raising is normal. OBJECTIVE: Sensory examination is normal to all modalities. Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine. Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities. Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle. It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle. There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: 1. A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy. 2. Left S1 nerve root irritation. There is no evidence of active radiculopathy. 3. There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy. MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right. Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter. I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ. If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered. She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future.",
  "layman": "**History:**  \nThe patient is a 56‑year‑old right‑handed woman who has had occasional right lower back pain for many years. She was in a car accident in September 2005. She didn’t notice any injury at the time, but five days later she began to feel unusual pain in her right lower back. The pain now spreads into her buttock, down the back of her thigh, and into the outer part of her right calf. It gets worse when she sits for a long time (for example, while driving). Walking for a long time causes only mild symptoms. Standing or lying down helps. She has no pain or weakness in her left leg, and her bowel or bladder function is unchanged. The pain has slowly gotten worse over time. She has taken Medrol Dosepak and pain medicines, but they haven’t helped much. She had a spinal epidural injection about four and a half weeks ago; it worked for a few hours but the pain returned the next day.\n\nOn exam, her leg muscles are strong and equal on both sides. Raising her leg straight (straight‑leg raise test) is normal.  \n\n**Objective findings:**  \n- Sensation is normal in all tests.  \n- She can move her lower back fully.  \n- There is a little tenderness over the muscles next to her lower back and over the sacroiliac joint.  \n- Knee reflexes are normal (2+).  \n- Left ankle reflex is 2, right ankle reflex is 1+.  \n\n**Nerve conduction studies:**  \nAll tests of nerve speed and strength in the legs are normal. The right tibial H‑reflex is a bit slower than the left.  \n\n**Needle EMG:**  \nUsing a small needle, the doctor checked both legs and the lower back muscles. The test showed:\n- Extra muscle activity when the needle was inserted into the right mid and lower back muscles and the right peroneus longus muscle.  \n- Signs of long‑term nerve damage in the right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and the left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.  \n\n**Impression (summary of results):**  \nThe electrical tests are abnormal. They show:\n1. Mild irritation of the right L5 or S1 nerve root.  \n2. Irritation of the left S1 nerve root.  \n3. No active nerve root pain, no nerve bundle (plexus) problem, no muscle disease, and no peripheral nerve disease.  \n\nAn MRI of her lower back shows narrowing of the spaces where the nerves exit at L5‑S1 on both sides, a little worse on the right.  \n\nThe results were explained to the patient and her daughter. The recommendation is to try more spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ. If those don’t help, surgery may be needed. The patient agrees with this plan and will return for follow‑up soon."
