  "medical": "A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram is performed on the patient, predominantly in a drowsy and sleepy state. In brief periods of wakefulness, significant muscle artifact is noted bilaterally. With drowsiness, the recording slows, and with the sleep, vertex activity is noted. Recording is somewhat disorganized for age with intermixed theta and alpha activity. At times, higher voltage slowing is noted over the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions. Rare sharp wave activity is noted generally on the right over the C4 electrode, but rarely on the left over the T3 electrode. No spike-and-wave activity is noted. IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram revealing generalized poorly organized slowing, with more prominent slowing noted at the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions and rare sharp wave activity noted bilaterally, somewhat more prevalent on the right. Clinical correlation is suggested.",
  "layman": "A 21‑channel digital EEG was done while the patient was mostly drowsy and sleepy. When the patient was briefly awake, there was noticeable muscle noise on both sides. As the patient became more drowsy, the brain waves slowed, and when the patient fell asleep, activity was seen over the top of the head. The pattern was a bit disorganized for the patient’s age, with a mix of theta and alpha waves. Sometimes the waves were higher in voltage on the right side of the head than on the left. Rare sharp waves appeared mainly on the right side (at the C4 spot) and only rarely on the left (at the T3 spot). No spike‑and‑wave patterns were seen.\n\n**Impression:** The EEG is abnormal, showing general slowing that is poorly organized, especially on the right side of the head, with occasional sharp waves on both sides but more on the right. A clinical review is recommended."
