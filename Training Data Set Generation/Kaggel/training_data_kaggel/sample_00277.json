  "medical": "EXAM: MRI Head W&WO Contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: Dyspnea. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the head performed without and with 12 ml of IV gadolinium (Magnevist). INTERPRETATION: There are no abnormal/unexpected foci of contrast enhancement. There are no diffusion weighted signal abnormalities. There are minimal, predominantly periventricular, deep white matter patchy foci of FLAIR/T2 signal hyperintensity, the rest of the brain parenchyma appearing unremarkable in signal. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, but proportionate. Per T2 weighted sequence, there is no hyperdense vascularity. There are no calvarial signal abnormalities. There is no significant mastoid air cell fluid. No significant sinus mucosal disease per MRI. IMPRESSION: 1. No abnormal/unexpected foci of contrast enhancement; specifically, no evidence for metastases or masses. 2. No evidence for acute infarction. 3. Mild, scattered, patchy, chronic small vessel ischemic disease changes. 4. Diffuse cortical volume loss, consistent with patient's age. 5. Preliminary report was issued at the time of dictation.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the head with and without contrast.  \nREASON FOR EXAM: Shortness of breath.  \nCOMPARISON: None.  \nTECHNIQUE: The scan was done first without and then with 12 ml of IV gadolinium (Magnevist).  \n\nINTERPRETATION:  \n- No abnormal spots show up after the contrast is given.  \n- No areas look abnormal on diffusion imaging.  \n- There are a few small, patchy bright spots in the deep white matter near the brain’s ventricles; the rest of the brain looks normal.  \n- The ventricles and grooves (sulci) are a bit enlarged but are in proportion to the brain size.  \n- No abnormal blood vessels are seen on T2 images.  \n- The skull bones look normal.  \n- The mastoid air cells have no fluid.  \n- The sinuses show no significant lining disease.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. No abnormal spots after contrast; no signs of cancer spread or tumors.  \n2. No signs of a recent stroke.  \n3. Mild, scattered changes from long‑term small vessel disease.  \n4. General brain shrinkage that matches the patient’s age.  \n5. A preliminary report was given when the scan was read."
