  "medical": "This is a middle-aged male with an epiglottic mass, odynophagia, and involvement of the left aryepiglottic fold, piriform sinus, and vallecula. High resolution transaxial images were obtained with reformatted sagittal and coronal images. FINDINGS: There is a lobulated mass lesion of the epiglottis measuring approximately 22 x 16 x 30 mm (mediolateral x AP x craniocaudal) in size. There is slightly greater involvement on the right side however there is bilateral involvement of the aryepiglottic folds. There is marked enlargement of the bilateral aryepiglottic folds (left greater than right). There is thickening of the glossoepiglottic fold. There is an infiltrative mass like lesion extending into the pre-epiglottic space. There is no demonstrated effacement of the piriform sinuses. The mass obliterates the right vallecula. The paraglottic spaces are normal. The true and false cords appear normal. Normal thyroid, cricoid and arytenoid cartilages. There is lobulated thickening of the right side of the tongue base, for which invasion of the tongue cannot be excluded. A MRI examination would be of benefit for further evaluation of this finding. There is a 14 x 5 x 12 mm node involving the left submental region (Level I). There is borderline enlargement of the bilateral jugulodigastric nodes (Level II). The left jugulodigastric node measures 14 x 11 x 8 mm while the right jugulodigastric node measures 15 x 12 x 8 mm. There is an enlarged second left high deep cervical node measuring 19 x 14 x 15 mm also consistent with a left Level II node, with a probable necrotic center. There is an enlarged second right high deep cervical node measuring 12 x 10 x 10 mm but no demonstrated central necrosis. There is an enlarged left mid level deep cervical node measuring 9 x 16 x 6 mm, located inferior to the hyoid bone but cephalad to the cricoid consistent with a Level III node. There are two enlarged matted nodes involving the right mid level deep cervical chain consistent with a right Level III nodal disease, producing a conglomerate nodal mass measuring approximately 26 x 12 x 10 mm. There is a left low level deep cervical node lying along the inferior edge of the cricoid cartilage measuring approximately 18 x 11 x 14 mm consistent with left Level IV nodal disease. There is no demonstrated pretracheal, prelaryngeal or superior mediastinal nodes. There is no demonstrated retropharyngeal adenopathy. There is thickening of the adenoidal pad without a mass lesion of the nasopharynx. The torus tubarius and fossa of Rosenmuller appear normal. IMPRESSION: Epiglottic mass lesion with probable invasion of the glossoepiglottic fold and pre-epiglottic space with invasion of the bilateral aryepiglottic folds. Lobulated tongue base for which tongue invasion cannot be excluded. An MRI may be of benefit for further assessment of this finding. Borderline enlargement of a submental node suggesting Level I adenopathy. Bilateral deep cervical nodal disease involving bilateral Level II, Level III and left Level IV.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged man who has a painful swallowing problem and a lump on his epiglottis (the flap that covers the windpipe). The lump also touches the left side of the folds near the epiglottis, the pouches behind the larynx, and the space between the folds.\n\nHigh‑resolution cross‑sectional images were taken, and side and front view images were also made.\n\n**Findings**\n\n- A bumpy lump on the epiglottis that measures about 22 mm wide, 16 mm front‑to‑back, and 30 mm top‑to‑bottom.  \n- The lump is a little larger on the right side, but both sides of the folds near the epiglottis are involved.  \n- Both folds near the epiglottis are noticeably enlarged (the left side more than the right).  \n- The fold that connects the tongue to the epiglottis is thickened.  \n- The lump extends into the space just in front of the epiglottis.  \n- The pouches behind the larynx are not blocked.  \n- The lump blocks the right space between the folds.  \n- The areas next to the vocal cords are normal.  \n- The vocal cords themselves look normal.  \n- The thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoid bones are normal.  \n- The back of the tongue shows a bumpy thickening on the right side; it is not clear if the tongue itself is involved. An MRI scan would help look at this more closely.  \n- A lymph node in the left submental area (Level I) measures 14 × 5 × 12 mm.  \n- Lymph nodes on both sides of the neck (Level II) are just a little larger. The left node is 14 × 11 × 8 mm; the right is 15 × 12 × 8 mm.  \n- A second left high deep cervical node (Level II) is 19 × 14 × 15 mm and probably has a dead center.  \n- A second right high deep cervical node (Level II) is 12 × 10 × 10 mm with no dead center.  \n- A left mid‑level deep cervical node (Level III) is 9 × 16 × 6 mm, located below the hyoid bone but above the cricoid.  \n- Two right mid‑level deep cervical nodes (Level III) are stuck together, forming a cluster about 26 × 12 × 10 mm.  \n- A left low‑level deep cervical node (Level IV) along the lower edge of the cricoid is 18 × 11 × 14 mm.  \n- No nodes were seen in front of the trachea, larynx, or upper chest, and none were seen behind the throat.  \n- The adenoid tissue is thickened, but there is no lump in the back of the nose.  \n- The structures in the back of the nose (torus tubarius and fossa of Rosenmuller) look normal.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThere is a lump on the epiglottis that likely spreads to the fold that connects the tongue to the epiglottis and the space in front of the epiglottis, and it touches both folds near the epiglottis. The back of the tongue shows a bumpy thickening that may involve the tongue. An MRI scan would help evaluate this.  \nA slightly enlarged lymph node under the chin suggests Level I involvement.  \nThere is widespread lymph node disease in both sides of the neck, affecting Levels II, III, and left Level IV."
