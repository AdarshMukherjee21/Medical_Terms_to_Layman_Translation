  "medical": "REASON FOR ADMISSION: Cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis. ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES 1. Status post roux-en-y gastric bypass converted to an open procedure in 01/07. 2. Laparoscopic paraventral hernia in 11/07. 3. History of sleep apnea with reversal after 100-pound weight loss. 4. Morbid obesity with bmi of 39.4. PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopy converted to open common bile duct exploration and stone extraction. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 33-year-old female admitted with elevated bilirubin and probable common bile duct stone. She was admitted through the emergency room with abdominal pain, elevated bilirubin, and gallstones on ultrasound with a dilated common bile duct. She subsequently went for a HIDA scan to rule out cholecystitis. Gallbladder was filled but was unable to empty into the small bowel consistent with the common bile duct blockage. She was taken to the operating room that night for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We proceeded with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and during the cholangiogram there was no contrast. It was able to be extravasated into the duodenum with the filling defect consistent with the distal common bile duct stone. The patient had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but could not receive an ERCP and stone extraction, therefore, common bile duct exploration was performed and a stone was extracted. This necessitated conversion to an open operation. She was transferred to the medical surgical unit postoperatively. She had a significant amount of incisional pain following morning, but no nausea. A Jackson-Pratt drain, which was left in place in two places showed serosanguineous fluid. White blood cell count was down to 7500 and bilirubin decreased to 2.1. Next morning she was started on a liquid diet. Foley catheter was discontinued. There was no evidence of bile leak from the drains. She was advanced to a regular diet on postoperative day #3, which was 12/09/07. The following morning she was tolerating regular diet. Her bowels had begun to function, and she was afebrile with her pain control with oral pain medications. Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued from the wound. The remaining Jackson-Pratt drain was left adjacent to her cystic duct. Following morning, her laboratory studies were better. Her bilirubin was down to normal and white blood cell count was normal with an H&H of 9 and 26.3. Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued, and she was discharged home. Followup was in 3 days for staple removal. She was given iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lortab elixir 15 cc p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. for pain.",
  "layman": "**Reason for admission:**  \nThe patient was admitted because she had inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) and a stone in the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis).\n\n**Discharge diagnoses:**  \n- Cholecystitis  \n- Choledocholithiasis  \n\n**Other diagnoses:**  \n1. She had a Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass that was turned into an open surgery on January 7.  \n2. She had a laparoscopic paraventral hernia repair in November 7.  \n3. She has a history of sleep apnea that improved after losing 100 pounds.  \n4. She is morbidly obese with a BMI of 39.4.\n\n**Main procedure:**  \nLaparoscopic removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). The laparoscopy was converted to an open surgery to explore the common bile duct and remove a stone.\n\n**Hospital course:**  \nA 33‑year‑old woman was taken to the emergency room with abdominal pain, high bilirubin, and gallstones seen on ultrasound. The ultrasound also showed a widened common bile duct. A HIDA scan confirmed that the gallbladder was full but could not empty into the small intestine, indicating a blockage in the common bile duct.\n\nShe went to the operating room that night for a laparoscopic gallbladder removal. During the procedure a cholangiogram (imaging of the bile ducts) showed no contrast filling the ducts, but a filling defect that matched a stone in the lower part of the common bile duct. Because she had had a Roux‑en‑Y bypass, she could not have an ERCP (a procedure to remove bile duct stones), so the surgeons performed a common bile duct exploration and removed the stone. This required converting the laparoscopy to an open surgery.\n\nAfter surgery she was moved to the medical‑surgical unit. The next morning she had a lot of pain at the incision site but no nausea. Two Jackson‑Pratt drains were left in place and were draining a mix of clear fluid and blood. Her white‑blood‑cell count dropped to 7,500 and her bilirubin fell to 2.1. The next day she was started on a liquid diet and her urinary catheter was removed. There was no sign of bile leaking from the drains. On postoperative day 3 (December 9, 07) she was eating a regular diet. The next morning she was tolerating the regular diet well, her bowels were working, she had no fever, and her pain was controlled with oral pain medication. The Jackson‑Pratt drain at the incision site was removed, leaving one drain near the cystic duct. The following morning her labs improved further: bilirubin returned to normal and her white‑blood‑cell count was normal. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit were 9 and 26.3, respectively. The remaining drain was removed and she was discharged home. She was scheduled for a follow‑up visit in three days to have her staples removed. She was prescribed iron 325 mg by mouth three times a day and Lortab elixir 15 cc by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain."
