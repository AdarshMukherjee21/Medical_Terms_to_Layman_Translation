  "medical": "A survey film of the abdomen shows no soft tissue abnormalities and no pathologic calcifications overlying the renal contours or bladder. Following intravenous infusion of appropriate contrast material, there is prompt symmetrical concentration as noted by nephrograms. No filling defects of the collecting systems are noted on the linear tomograms. There is normal and symmetrical filling of the caliceal system. Subsequent films demonstrate that the kidneys are of normal size and contour bilaterally. The caliceal system and ureters are in their usual position and show no signs of obstruction or intraluminal defects. The postvoid films demonstrate normal emptying of the collecting system, including the urinary bladder. IMPRESSION: Negative intravenous urogram.",
  "layman": "A quick abdominal X‑ray shows no abnormal soft tissues and no unusual calcium deposits over the kidneys or bladder.  \nAfter giving contrast through a vein, the kidneys fill quickly and evenly, as seen on the images.  \nThe linear images show no blockages in the kidney drainage areas.  \nThe kidney calyces fill normally and evenly.  \nLater images confirm both kidneys are the normal size and shape.  \nThe kidney calyces and tubes (ureters) are in the right place and have no blockages or internal problems.  \nAfter urination, the images show the kidney drainage areas and bladder emptying normally.  \n**Conclusion:** The study shows no problems."
