  "medical": "EXAM: MRI of lumbar spine without contrast. HISTORY: A 24-year-old female with chronic back pain. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial and sagittal images were acquired through the lumbar spine in varying degrees of fat and water weighting. FINDINGS: The visualized cord is normal in signal intensity and morphology with conus terminating in proper position. Visualized osseous structures are normal in marrow signal intensity and morphology without evidence for fracture/contusion, compression deformity, or marrow replacement process. There are no paraspinal masses. Disc heights, signal, and vertebral body heights are maintained throughout the lumbar spine. L5-S1: Central canal, neural foramina are patent. L4-L5: Central canal, neural foramina are patent. L3-L4: Central canal, neural foramen is patent. L2-L3: Central canal, neural foramina are patent. L1-L2: Central canal, neural foramina are patent. The visualized abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. Incidental note has been made of multiple left-sided ovarian, probable physiologic follicular cysts. IMPRESSION: No acute disease in the lumbar spine.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the lower back without contrast.  \nHISTORY: A 24‑year‑old woman with long‑standing back pain.  \nTECHNIQUE: Images were taken in different ways to show both fat and water in the lower spine.  \nFINDINGS: The spinal cord looks normal and ends in the right place. The bones of the spine look normal, with no fractures, bruises, compression, or abnormal bone marrow. There are no tumors next to the spine. The spaces between the discs and the bones are normal, and the discs themselves are healthy.  \n- At the L5‑S1 level, the spinal canal and the openings for the nerves are open.  \n- At L4‑L5, the canal and nerve openings are open.  \n- At L3‑L4, the canal and nerve opening are open.  \n- At L2‑L3, the canal and nerve openings are open.  \n- At L1‑L2, the canal and nerve openings are open.  \nThe visible part of the abdominal aorta is normal in size. An incidental finding is that she has several small, likely normal, cysts on the left ovary.  \nIMPRESSION: No new or urgent problems in the lower spine."
