FINDINGS: The patient was undergoing a cesarean section for twins. During the course of the procedure, a bladder laceration was notices and urology was consulted. Findings were a laceration on the dome of the bladder. PROCEDURE: Initially there as a mucosal layer of suture already placed. This was done with 3-0 chromic catgut. The bladder was distended and, while the bladder was distended with physiologic saline, a second layer of 3-0 chromic catgut created a watertight closure. The second layer included the mucosa an dinner layer of the detrusor muscle. A third layer of 2-0 Dexon was used. Each of these were placed in a continuous running-locked suture technique. There was complete watertight closure of the bladder. Hemostasis was assured and a Jackson-Pratt drain was brought out through a separate stab wound. The remaining portion of the operation, both the cesarean section and the wound closure, will be dictated by Dr. Redmond.",

While the surgery was going on, a tear in the bladder was found and a urologist was called. The tear was on the top (dome) of the bladder. PROCEDURE: First, a layer of stitches was already in place on the inside lining of the bladder. These stitches were made with 3‑0 chromic catgut. The bladder was filled with normal saline, and a second layer of 3‑0 chromic catgut was sewn to make the repair watertight. This second layer covered the inside lining and the outer muscle layer (detrusor). A third layer of 2‑0 Dexon was added. All three layers were sewn in a continuous, locked running stitch. The bladder was closed completely and no leaks were seen. Bleeding was stopped and a Jackson‑Pratt drain was placed through a small separate incision. The rest of the surgery, including the C‑section and closing the main incision, will be described by Dr. Redmond."
