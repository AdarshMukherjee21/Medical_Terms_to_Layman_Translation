  "medical": "OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring. This incision was about 1.5 cm in length. The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique. This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia. The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free. A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located. Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring. This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially. The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity. Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels. Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance. The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high. This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum. The testicle was viable. This was wrapped in a moist sponge. Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum. A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall. Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer. A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection. The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided. The hemostat was then passed through the incision. A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal. The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision. The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle. The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture. Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed. Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly. This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures. The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture. The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch. Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied. The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and laid flat on the table. The area was cleaned and covered in a sterile way. A small cut, about 1.5 cm long, was made in the crease of the groin over the internal ring. The cut was taken down through the layers of tissue to the level of the external oblique muscle. The muscle was opened along its fibers and the surgery continued through the outer covering of the spermatic cord. The next layer, the cremasteric fascia, was cut and the inner covering of the spermatic cord was pulled free. A hernia sac was found and the testicle was located. The inner covering was cut and the hernia sac was freed from inside the internal ring by cutting the transversalis fascia all around it. The hernia sac was tied off with a 3‑0 silk suture high up, cut, and it fell back into the abdominal cavity. Care was taken not to damage the testicular blood vessels. The abnormal attachments of the testicle were cut away at the lower end, making sure not to cut the long vas. These were cut under the testicle for a good distance. The side attachments that were holding the cord vessels were freed from the side walls high in the back of the abdomen. This gave the testicle enough length to be moved down into the upper front part of the scrotum. The testicle was healthy. It was wrapped in a moist sponge. A clamp was passed down the inguinal canal into the scrotum. A small 1 cm cut was made in the front upper wall of the scrotum. The cut was taken down through the dartos layer. A pocket under the dartos was made with blunt dissection. The clamp was pushed against the tissues and the tissue was cut. The clamp was then pulled through the incision. A Crile clamp was passed back up into the inguinal canal. The lower attachments of the sac were grabbed and pulled down without twisting them through the incision. The neck of the sac was closed with a 4‑0 Vicryl suture that was snug enough to keep the testicle from pulling back but not too tight. The testicle was then placed in its proper position in the pocket and the tissue under the skin was closed with a running 4‑0 chromic suture and the skin was closed with a running 6‑0 subcuticular chromic suture. Benzoin and a Steri‑Strip were applied. Next the arch of the transversus abdominis muscle was re‑stitched to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten the ring a little. This was done with 2–3 interrupted 3‑0 silk sutures. The external oblique muscle was closed with interrupted 3‑0 silk sutures. The Scarpa’s layer was closed with a running 4‑0 chromic suture and the skin was closed with a running 4‑0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch. Benzoin and a Steri‑Strip were applied again. The testicle was in good position in the lower part of the scrotum. The patient received a caudal block, woke up, and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
