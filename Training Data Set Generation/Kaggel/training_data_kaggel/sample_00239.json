POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Mallory-Weiss tear, submucosal hemorrhage consistent with trauma from vomiting and grade 2 esophagitis. PROCEDURE: The procedure, indications explained and he understood and agreed. He was sedated with Versed 3, Demerol 25 and topical Hurricane spray to the oropharynx. A bite block was placed. The Pentax video gastroscope was advanced through the oropharynx into the esophagus under direct vision. Esophagus revealed distal ulcerations. Additionally, the patient had a Mallory-Weiss tear. This was subjected to bicap cautery with good ablation. The stomach was entered, which revealed areas of submucosal hemorrhage consistent with trauma from vomiting. There were no ulcerations or erosions in the stomach. The duodenum was entered, which was unremarkable. The instrument was then removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications. IMPRESSION: Mallory-Weiss tear, successful BICAP cautery. We will keep the patient on proton pump inhibitors. The patient will remain on antiemetics and be started on a clear liquid diet.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Vomiting blood in a person who has had diabetes for a long time.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: A Mallory‑Weiss tear and bleeding under the lining of the stomach, caused by forceful vomiting, plus moderate esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus).  \n\nPROCEDURE: The doctor explained the procedure and the patient understood and agreed. He was given Versed 3, Demerol 25, and a spray called Hurricane to numb his throat. A bite block was put in his mouth. The Pentax video gastroscope was carefully passed through his throat into his esophagus while the doctor watched the screen. The esophagus showed ulcers near the bottom. The patient also had a Mallory‑Weiss tear, which was treated with a BICAP cautery device that successfully removed the damaged tissue. The scope was then moved into the stomach, where the doctor saw bleeding under the lining that matched the vomiting injury. No ulcers or erosions were found in the stomach. The scope was then moved into the duodenum, which looked normal. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Mallory‑Weiss tear treated successfully with BICAP cautery. The patient will stay on proton pump inhibitors, anti‑nausea medication, and will start a clear liquid diet."
