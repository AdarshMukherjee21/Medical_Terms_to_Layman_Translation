Tailor bunion deformity, right foot. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Tailor bunionectomy, right foot, Weil-type with screw fixation. ANESTHESIA: Local with MAC, local consisting of 20 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: Pneumatic ankle tourniquet at 200 mmHg. INJECTABLES: A 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate. MATERIAL: A 2.4 x 14 mm, 2.4 x 16 mm, and 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw. A 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 nylon. COMPLICATIONS: None. SPECIMENS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the usual supine position. At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis. Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site. The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner. An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg. Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made. The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections. All major neurovascular structures were avoided. At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified. This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle. This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed. At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed. Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced. Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision. The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field. A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye. The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position. The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation. At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position. At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation. Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site. Compression was noted to be excellent. All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed. Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field. The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline. At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated. At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon. At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension. Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided. A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal. Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field. Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head. The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position. A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site. This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent. Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field. The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline. The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon. At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site. The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot. The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot. After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A. The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot. The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well. Dr. A was present throughout the entire case.",

Tailor bunion deformity (bony bump on the side of the foot) – right foot.  \n\n**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES**  \n1. Hallux abductovalgus deformity – right foot.  \n2. Tailor bunion deformity – right foot.  \n\n**PROCEDURES PERFORMED**  \nTailor bunionectomy on the right foot, using a Weil‑type cut and screw fixation.  \n\n**ANESTHESIA**  \nLocal anesthesia with monitored anesthesia care (MAC). 20 mL of 0.5 % plain Marcaine was injected.  \n\n**HEMOSTASIS**  \nA pneumatic ankle tourniquet was set to 200 mmHg to stop bleeding.  \n\n**INJECTABLES**  \n10 mL of 0.5 % plain Marcaine + 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were given.  \n\n**MATERIALS USED**  \n- OsteoMed non‑cannulated screws: 2.4 × 14 mm, 2.4 × 16 mm, 2.0 × 10 mm.  \n- Sutures: 2‑0 Vicryl, 3‑0 Vicryl, 4‑0 Vicryl, 5‑0 nylon.  \n\n**COMPLICATIONS**  \nNone.  \n\n**SPECIMENS**  \nNone.  \n\n**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**  \nMinimal.  \n\n**PROCEDURE IN DETAIL**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laid on the table lying on her back. A pneumatic tourniquet was placed on the right ankle to keep the area dry. After a brief period of mild sedation, the local anesthetic was injected around the surgical site. The right foot was cleaned, prepared, and covered with sterile drapes. An Esmarch bandage was used to remove blood from the foot, and the tourniquet was inflated to 200 mmHg.  \n\nA 3.5 cm long, straight incision was made on the top side of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (the joint where the big toe meets the foot). The incision was deepened with sharp and blunt tools while avoiding major nerves and blood vessels. Through this incision, the surgeon reached the space between the first and second metatarsal bones. The deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was cut completely, exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle. The muscle was removed from its bone attachments and a small cut was made in the tendon. A small cut in the joint capsule on the side was also made. The tightness on the side of the joint was checked and found to be greatly reduced.  \n\nThe surgeon then made cuts on the top side of the first metatarsal head, following the shape of the original incision. The bone layers around the joint were lifted on both sides. Using a saw, the head of the first metatarsal and the medial bump were cut away and removed. A 0.045‑inch K‑wire was placed across the head to help guide the next steps. The patient’s leg was positioned in a frog‑leg position, and two cuts were made: one from the guide to the bottom front of the bone and one from the guide to the top front. The top cut was longer than the bottom cut to allow for proper fixation. The front part of the bone was removed and moved laterally into a more correct position. Three short K‑wires were temporarily placed across the cut. Two 3.4 × 15 mm and one 2.4 × 14 mm screws were then inserted across the cut, providing strong compression. All wires were removed. The remaining overhanging bone on the medial side was cut away and removed. The wound was washed thoroughly with sterile saline. The bone and joint layers were stitched back together with 2‑0 and 3‑0 Vicryl. The skin was closed in layers with 4‑0 Vicryl and 4‑0 nylon.  \n\nNext, the top side of the right fifth metatarsal (the bone next to the little toe) was addressed. A straight incision was made just above the joint, slightly to the side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon. The incision was deepened carefully, avoiding nerves and vessels. The bone and joint layers on the side of the tendon were lifted. Using a saw, the lateral bump was cut away and removed. A Weil‑type cut was made at the head of the fifth metatarsal, and the head was moved medially into a better position. A 0.045‑inch K‑wire was used temporarily, and a 2.0 × 10 mm screw was placed across the cut, giving good compression. The overhanging bone on the top side was cut away and removed. The wound was washed again with saline. The bone and joint layers were stitched with 3‑0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4‑0 Vicryl and 4‑0 nylon.  \n\nAfter the bone work, 10 mL of 0.5 % plain Marcaine and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were injected around the surgical area. The right foot was covered with Xeroform gauze, foam, a Kling wrap, and an Ace wrap, all applied with gentle pressure. The tourniquet was released, and the foot showed a normal rush of blood to all toes.  \n\nThe patient was moved to the recovery room with stable vital signs and good foot circulation. After a short observation period, she was sent home with written and verbal instructions: keep the dressing clean, dry, and intact; follow up with Dr. A; stay non‑weight‑bearing on the right foot; and take prescribed pain medication (NSAIDs). The patient tolerated the surgery and anesthesia well. Dr. A was present throughout the entire procedure."
