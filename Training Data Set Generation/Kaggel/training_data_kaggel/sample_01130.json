  "medical": "EXAM: Ultrasound Abdomen. REASON FOR EXAM: Elevated liver function tests. INTERPRETATION: The liver demonstrates heterogeneously increased echotexture with significant fatty infiltration. The gallbladder is surgically absent. There is no fluid collection in the cholecystectomy bed. There is dilatation of the common bile duct up to 1 cm. There is also dilatation of the pancreatic duct that measures up to 3 mm. There is caliectasis in the right kidney. The bladder is significantly distended measuring 937 cc in volume. The caliectasis in the right kidney may be secondary to back pressure from the distended bladder. The aorta is normal in caliber. IMPRESSION: 1. Dilated common duct as well as pancreatic duct as described. Given the dilatation of these two ducts, ERCP versus MRCP is recommended to exclude obstructing mass. The findings could reflect changes of cholecystectomy. 2. Significantly distended bladder with probably resultant caliectasis in the right kidney. Clinical correlation recommended.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Ultrasound of the abdomen.  \nREASON FOR EXAM: High liver enzyme levels.  \n\nINTERPRETATION:  \n- The liver looks uneven and has a lot of fat.  \n- The gallbladder is gone because it was removed.  \n- There is no fluid where the gallbladder used to be.  \n- The common bile duct is widened to about 1 cm.  \n- The pancreatic duct is also widened, measuring about 3 mm.  \n- The right kidney has a mild swelling of its ducts (caliectasis).  \n- The bladder is very full, holding about 937 cc of urine.  \n- The kidney swelling may be caused by the pressure from the full bladder.  \n- The aorta looks normal.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. The widened bile and pancreatic ducts suggest a possible blockage; further imaging with ERCP or MRCP is advised to check for a mass. These changes could be related to the gallbladder removal.  \n2. The very full bladder is likely causing the kidney swelling. Follow‑up with a doctor is recommended."
