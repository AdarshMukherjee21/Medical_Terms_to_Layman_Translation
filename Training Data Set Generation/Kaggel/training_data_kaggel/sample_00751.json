Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot. PROCEDURES: 1. Distal metaphyseal osteotomy and bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, right foot. 2. Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot. ANESTHESIA: Local infiltrate with IV sedation. INDICATION FOR SURGERY: The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems. The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment. The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options. The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail. The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain. All questions were thoroughly answered. The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities. The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort. DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position. No tourniquet was utilized. IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site. The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Balanced anesthesia was obtained. PROCEDURE #1: Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot. A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx. Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized. A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision. The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface. Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head. The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound. Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition. The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition. An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration. Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove. The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp. Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment. The access guide was noted to be in good position. A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed. The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal. The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head. The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal. Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment. It was then fixated with 1 screw. A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction. The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position. Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory. Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site. Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally. All rough edges were rasped smooth. Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux. A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated. PROCEDURE #2: Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux. The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint. All vital structures were identified and retracted. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface. The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux. Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected. The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position. Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site. The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved. The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation. The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips. Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia. A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time. A walker boot was dispensed and applied. The patient should wear it when walking or standing. The next office visit will be in 4 days. The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions. The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress.",
  "layman": "**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES**  \n1. The first metatarsal (the long bone in the front of the foot) is angled inward and has a bunion on the right foot.  \n2. The big toe is angled outward and upward (hallux abductovalgus) on the right foot.  \n\n**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES**  \n1. Same as above – first metatarsal angled inward with a bunion, right foot.  \n2. Same as above – big toe angled outward and upward, right foot.  \n\n**PROCEDURES**  \n1. Cutting the bone near the tip of the first metatarsal and removing the bunion, then fixing the bone with an internal screw – right foot.  \n2. Cutting the bone of the first toe (proximal phalanx) and realigning it with an internal screw to correct the angle – right foot.  \n\n**ANESTHESIA**  \nLocal injection of anesthetic with IV sedation.  \n\n**INDICATION FOR SURGERY**  \nThe patient has had foot problems for a long time. The problems have gotten worse and did not improve with non‑surgical treatments. The doctor explained all treatment options, the details of the surgery, and possible risks such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, ongoing pain, and the chance that the problem might return. The patient was told that most people feel better after surgery, but success cannot be guaranteed. All questions were answered. The patient chose surgery because the pain and deformity were interfering with daily life. The goal is to reduce pain and discomfort.  \n\n**DETAILS OF PROCEDURE**  \n\nThe patient was taken to the operating room, lay on her back, and was given IV sedation. About 10 mL of a 1:1 mix of 0.25 % Marcaine and 1 % lidocaine with epinephrine was injected near the surgical area. The leg was cleaned and covered in sterile drapes.  \n\n**Procedure #1 – Bunion removal and bone realignment**  \nA curved incision was made on the top side of the foot, just inside the tendon that pulls the big toe. The incision went from the lower third of the first metatarsal to the middle of the first toe. Care was taken to protect nerves and blood vessels; any vessels that needed to be cut were sealed with cautery. The tissue layers were cut through to expose the bone.  \n\nThe surgeon saw that the angle between the first and second metatarsals was larger than normal and that the head of the first metatarsal was enlarged. The head of the first metatarsal was freed from its attachments and moved out of the way. The joint surface of the big toe and the sesamoid bones looked okay.  \n\nAn oscillating saw removed the enlarged part of the first metatarsal head, keeping the groove that runs along the front of the bone. The rough edges were smoothed with a rasp. The surgeon then used a guide wire to set the direction for cutting the bone. A horizontal cut was made from the guide wire, with the cut’s tip toward the bottom of the foot and the base toward the top. This created a wedge that could be moved laterally. The wedge was pulled out of the way, moved to the side to reduce the angle between the first and second metatarsals, and then pushed back into place. The alignment looked good.  \n\nA screw was inserted from the top of the wedge to the bottom of the shaft of the first metatarsal to hold the bone in place. The screw was the correct length and provided good compression. The surgeon also cut a small piece of bone from the medial side of the lower third of the first metatarsal to make room for the moved wedge. The edges were smoothed again.  \n\nThe big toe still pointed outward, so a second procedure was needed.  \n\n**Procedure #2 – Realigning the big toe**  \nThe original incision was extended just below the joint that connects the two parts of the big toe. Nerves and vessels were identified and moved aside. The tissue layers were cut through to expose the bone.  \n\nThe deformity was mainly in the lower part of the big toe. Using a saw, the surgeon made a wedge‑shaped cut that was angled so the tip was toward the top and side, and the base was toward the bottom and inside. The wedge was removed, the bone was realigned, and a guide wire was placed. A 14 mm screw was then inserted over the guide wire to hold the bone in the new position. The alignment looked good.  \n\nThe wound was washed with plenty of sterile saline. The outer layers of the foot were closed with running stitches of #3‑0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with #4‑0 nylon and reinforced with Steri‑Strips. About 6 mL of a 1:1 mix of 0.25 % Marcaine and 1 % lidocaine (plain) was injected near the surgical area for post‑op pain relief.  \n\nA dressing of Adaptic and a 4 × 4 bandage was applied, making sure the big toe was splinted. A compression wrap (ACE wrap) was added. The patient tolerated the surgery and anesthesia well and was sent to recovery with stable vital signs and good blood flow. A walker boot was given and should be worn when walking or standing.  \n\nThe next office visit is scheduled in 4 days. The patient was given a prescription for Percocet 5 mg (40 tablets) to take by mouth every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, along with written and verbal home instructions. The patient was discharged home with stable vital signs and no acute distress."
