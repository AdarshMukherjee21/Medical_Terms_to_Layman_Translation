  "medical": "CC: Gait difficulty. HX: This 59 y/o RHF was admitted with complaint of gait difficulty. The evening prior to admission she noted sudden onset of LUE and LLE weakness. She felt she favored her right leg, but did not fall when walking. She denied any associated dysarthria, facial weakness, chest pain, SOB, visual change, HA, nausea or vomiting. PMH: tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, skull fx 1954, HTN, HA. MEDS: none on day of exam. SHX: editorial assistant at newspaper, 40pk-yr Tobacco, no ETOH/Drugs. FHX: noncontributory ADMIT EXAM: P95 R20, T36.6, BP169/104 MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria, Naming-comprehension-reading intact. Euthymic with appropriate affect. CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light, Fundi flat, VFFTC, EOMI, Face symmetric with intact sensation, Gag-shrug-corneal reflexes intact, Tongue ML with full ROM Motor: Full strength throughout right side. Mildly decreased left grip and left extensor hallucis longus. Biceps/Triceps/Wrist flexors and extensor were full strength on left. However she demonstrated mild LUE pronator drift and had difficulty standing on her LLE despite full strength on bench testing of the LLE. Sensory: No deficit to PP/T/Vib/Prop/ LT Coord: decreased speed and magnitude of FNF, Finger tapping and HKS, on left side only. Station: mild LUE upward drift. Gait: tendency to drift toward the left. Difficulty standing on LLE. Reflexes were symmetric, plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Gen exam unremarkable. COURSE: Admit Labs: ESR, PT/PTT, GS, UA, EKG, and HCT were unremarkable. Hgb 13.9, Hct 41%, Plt 280k, WBC 5.5. The patient was diagnosed with a probable lacunar stroke and entered into the TOAST study (Trial of ORG10172[a low molecular weight heparin] in Acute Stroke Treatment). Carotid Duplex: 16-49%RICA and 0-15%LICA stenosis with anterograde vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and a left to right shunt. There was no evidence of blood clot. Hospital course: 5 days after admission the patient began to complain of proximal LLE and left flank pain. On exam, she had weakness of the quadriceps and hip flexors of the LLE. Her pain increased with left hip flexion. In addition, she complained of paresthesias about the lateral aspect of the medial anterior left thigh; and upon on sensory testing, she had decreased PP/TEMP sensation in a left femoral nerve distribution. She denied any back/neck pain and the rest of her neurologic exam remained unchanged from admission. Abdominal CT Scan, 2/4/96, revealed a large left retroperitoneal iliopsoas hematoma. Hgb 8.9g/dl. She was transfused with 4 units of pRBCs. She underwent surgical decompression and evacuation of the hematoma via a posterior flank approach on 2/6/96. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was discharged home on ASA. At follow-up, on 2/23/96, she complained of left sided paresthesias (worse in the LLE than in the LUE) and feeling of &quot;swollen left foot.&quot; These symptoms had developed approximately 1 month after her stroke. Her foot looked normal and her UE strength was 5/4+ proximally and distally, and LE strength 5/4+ proximally and 5/5- distally. She was ambulatory. There was no evidence of LUE upward drift. A somatosensory evoked potential study revealed an absent N20 and normal P14 potentials. This was suggestive of a lesion involving the right thalamus which might explain her paresthesia/dysesthesia as part of a Dejerine-Roussy syndrome.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nThe patient, a 59‑year‑old woman, was admitted because she had trouble walking.\n\n**History of Present Illness**  \nThe night before she was admitted she suddenly felt weakness in her left arm and left leg. She walked with a slight favoring of her right leg but did not fall. She had no trouble speaking, no facial weakness, no chest pain, shortness of breath, vision changes, headache, nausea, or vomiting.  \n\nPast medical history: tonsil removal, adenoid removal, a skull fracture in 1954, high blood pressure, and headaches.  \nShe was not taking any medications on the day of the exam.  \nShe works as an editorial assistant, smokes 40 packs‑years, and does not drink alcohol or use drugs. Family history was not significant.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- Vital signs: pulse 95, respiratory rate 20, temperature 36.6 °C, blood pressure 169/104 mm Hg.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  \n- Speech clear; naming, comprehension, and reading normal.  \n- Mood normal with appropriate emotions.  \n- Eyes: pupils equal, 4 mm, constricting to light; eye movements normal; face symmetrical; reflexes normal; tongue moves freely.  \n- Motor: right side normal strength. Left side: grip slightly weaker, and the big‑toe muscle weaker. Biceps, triceps, wrist flexors, and extensors on the left were normal. She had a mild drift of the left arm when she tried to hold it straight and had trouble standing on her left leg even though her leg strength was normal on a bench test.  \n- Sensation: no loss of touch, pain, temperature, vibration, or proprioception.  \n- Coordination: slower and smaller finger‑to‑nose, finger‑tapping, and heel‑knee‑shin movements on the left side only.  \n- Standing: mild drift of the left arm upward.  \n- Walking: tended to drift toward the left and had difficulty standing on the left leg.  \n- Reflexes symmetrical; toes flexed when pressed.  \n- General exam normal.\n\n**Laboratory Tests**  \nAll routine tests (ESR, clotting times, blood counts, urine, ECG, hematocrit) were normal.  \nHemoglobin 13.9 g/dL, hematocrit 41 %, platelets 280 k/µL, white cells 5.5 k/µL.\n\n**Diagnosis and Initial Management**  \nShe was diagnosed with a probable small (lacunar) stroke and enrolled in the TOAST study, which tests a low‑molecular‑weight heparin for acute stroke.  \nCarotid ultrasound showed 16‑49 % narrowing of the right internal carotid artery and 0‑15 % narrowing of the left.  \nHeart ultrasound showed mild leaking of the mitral and tricuspid valves and a small left‑to‑right shunt, but no blood clot.\n\n**Hospital Course**  \nFive days after admission she reported pain in the front of her left leg and left side of her body. Examination showed weakness of the thigh muscles and hip flexors on the left. Pain worsened when she bent her left hip. She also felt tingling along the outer part of the front of her left thigh. Sensation testing showed reduced pain and temperature in the area supplied by the left femoral nerve. She had no back or neck pain, and the rest of her neurological exam was unchanged.\n\nAn abdominal CT scan on February 4, 1996 revealed a large blood collection (hematoma) behind the left kidney in the iliopsoas muscle. Her hemoglobin had dropped to 8.9 g/dL. She received four units of packed red blood cells. On February 6, 1996 she had surgery to relieve pressure and remove the hematoma through a back‑flank incision. Her recovery after surgery was uncomplicated, and she was sent home on aspirin.\n\n**Follow‑up**  \nAt a visit on February 23, 1996 she reported tingling on the left side, worse in the left leg than in the left arm, and a feeling that her left foot was swollen. These symptoms appeared about one month after her stroke. Her foot looked normal. Upper‑extremity strength was 5/4+ both near the shoulder and at the wrist; lower‑extremity strength was 5/4+ near the hip and 5/5– at the ankle. She could walk normally. There was no drift of the left arm upward. A sensory‑evoked‑potential test showed an absent N20 wave but a normal P14 wave, suggesting a problem in the right thalamus that could explain her tingling and abnormal sensations as part of a Dejerine‑Roussy syndrome."
