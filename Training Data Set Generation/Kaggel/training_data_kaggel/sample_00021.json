Headaches, progressive (784.0). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Spondylosis with cervical stenosis C5-C6 greater than C4-C5, C6-C7, (721.0, 723.0). 2. Neck pain with left radiculopathy, progressive (723.1/723.4). 3. Headaches, progressive (784.0). PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 for neural decompression (63075). 2. Anterior interbody fusion C5-C6 (22554) utilizing Bengal cage (22851). 3. Anterior cervical instrumentation at C5-C6 for stabilization by Uniplate construction at C5-C6 (22845); with intraoperative x-ray x2. SERVICE: Neurosurgery ANESTHESIA: General. OPERATION: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leaning edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected with only blunt dissection. With only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and longus colli muscle was cauterized along the mesial border and self-retaining retractors were placed to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case. An intraoperative x-ray confirmed the interspace at C5-C6, C4-C5, and C6-C7 with prominent anterior osteophytes removed at C5-C6 noting particular disc collapse and far worsening spondylosis at C5-C6 than anywhere else in the neck. The annulus was cauterized and sharply excised and a discectomy followed with removing degenerated fragments of discs, which were sent to Pathology for permanent section in a routine fashion with straight disc forceps as needed, with residual discs drilled away as drilling extended from normal cortical cancellous elements with rather osteoporotic vertebral bodies noted. Prominent osteophytes were removed on the right side far more prominently on the left side with the worst compression on the nerve roots on the left, and all these were decompressed widely laterally bilaterally to completely decompress the dura, and the ligament as well, performed with a 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeur as necessary. The dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status finally and the entire area was inspected and at no time during the case there was evidence of CSF leakage of any type. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and an appropriate size Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position and was quite tightly applied. Further stability was added regardless with an appropriate size Uniplate with appropriate size screws and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and satisfactory postioning. After further inspection, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and closed in a routine fashion with approximation of the platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl reinforced with Steri-Strips. A Penrose drain was carried from the prevertebral space externally with the skin wound and safety pin for security and incorporated later into a sterile bandage in a routine fashion. The patient was then taking from the operative room and extubated to the recovery area having left in stable condition. At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. Age‑related wear and tear of the neck bones with narrowing of the spinal canal at the C5‑C6 level, more severe than at C4‑C5 or C6‑C7.  \n2. Neck pain that is getting worse and radiating to the left arm.  \n3. Headaches that are getting worse.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \nThe same three conditions listed above.  \n\n**Procedures performed**  \n1. Removal of the damaged disc at C5‑C6 to relieve pressure on the nerves.  \n2. Fusion of the C5‑C6 vertebrae using a special cage (Bengal cage).  \n3. Placement of a metal plate (Uniplate) at C5‑C6 to keep the spine stable, with two X‑rays taken during surgery.  \n\n**Service**  \nNeurosurgery.  \n\n**Anesthesia**  \nGeneral anesthesia.  \n\n**Operation**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, laid on their back, and given general anesthesia. The front of the neck was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A straight cut was made in the skin fold just right of the midline, down to the platysma muscle, which was separated gently. The space in front of the spine was reached and the longus colli muscle was cauterized along its inner edge. Retractors were used to keep surrounding tissues safe.  \n\nAn X‑ray taken during surgery confirmed the levels C5‑C6, C4‑C5, and C6‑C7. Large bone spurs were removed at C5‑C6, where the disc had collapsed and the wear was worst. The outer ring of the disc was cauterized and cut away, and the damaged disc material was removed. Pieces were sent to pathology. The bone spurs on the right were removed, and those on the left were removed more aggressively because they were pressing on the left nerve roots. The surgeon used small bone‑cutting tools to widen the space on both sides, fully decompressing the spinal cord and the surrounding ligament. The spinal cord bulged into the space, showing it had been freed, and no fluid leak was seen.  \n\nThe wound was washed with antibiotic solution. A properly sized Bengal cage was filled with the patient’s own bone and placed into the space, fitting tightly. A Uniplate with screws was added for extra stability, and an X‑ray confirmed everything was aligned correctly.  \n\nThe wound was washed again, the platysma muscle was stitched together with #3‑0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of #4‑0 Vicryl and reinforced with Steri‑Strips. A Penrose drain was placed from the front of the spine through the skin and secured with a safety pin, then covered with a sterile bandage.  \n\nThe patient was taken out of the operating room, the breathing tube removed, and sent to recovery in stable condition. All instruments, needles, and sponges were counted correctly, and there were no complications during the surgery."
