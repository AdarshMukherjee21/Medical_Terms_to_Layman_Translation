  "medical": "REASON FOR VISIT: Followup 4 months status post percutaneous screw fixation of a right Schatzker IV tibial plateau fracture and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures treated nonoperatively. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman who is now approximately 4 months status post percutaneous screw fixation of Schatzker IV tibial plateau fracture and nonoperative management of second through fifth metatarsal head fractures. He is currently at home and has left nursing home facility. He states that his pain is well controlled. He has been working with physical therapy two to three times a week. He has had no drainage or fever. He has noticed some increasing paresthesias in his bilateral feet but has a history of spinal stenosis with lower extremity neuropathy. FINDINGS: On physical exam, his incision is near well healed. He has no effusion noted. His range of motion is 10 to 105 degrees. He has no pain or crepitance. On examination of his right foot, he is nontender to palpation of the metatarsal heads. He has 4 out of 5 strength in EHL, FHL, tibialis, and gastroc-soleus complex. He does have decreased sensation to light touch in the L4-L5 distribution of his feet bilaterally. X-rays taken including AP and lateral of the right knee demonstrate a healed medial tibial plateau fracture status post percutaneous screw fixation. Examination of three views of the right foot demonstrates the second through fifth metatarsal head fractures. These appear to be extraarticular. They are all in a bayonet arrangement, but there appears to be bridging callus between the fragments on the oblique film. ASSESSMENT: Four months status post percutaneous screw fixation of the right medial tibial plateau and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures. PLANS: I would like the patient to continue working with physical therapy. He may be weightbearing as tolerated on his right side. I would like him to try to continue to work to gain full extension of the right knee and increase his knee flexion. I also would like him to work on ambulation and strengthening. I discussed with the patient his concerning symptoms of paresthesias. He said he has had the left thigh for a number of years and has been followed by a neurologist for this. He states that he has had some right-sided paresthesias now for a number of weeks. He claims he has no other symptoms of any worsening stenosis. I told him that I would see his neurologist for evaluation or possibly a spinal surgeon if his symptoms progress. The patient should follow up in 2 months at which time he should have AP and lateral of the right knee and three views of the right foot.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:**  \nFollow‑up 4 months after a small screw was used to fix a broken right knee (Schatzker IV tibial plateau fracture) and after treating broken bones in the second through fifth toes (metatarsal heads) without surgery.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nThe patient is a 59‑year‑old man who is about 4 months out from having a screw placed in his right knee and from having non‑surgical treatment of his broken toe bones. He is now at home after leaving a nursing home. He says his pain is well controlled. He has been doing physical therapy 2–3 times a week. He has had no drainage or fever. He has noticed some increasing tingling (paresthesias) in both feet, but he already has spinal stenosis that causes nerve problems in his legs.\n\n**Findings:**  \nDuring the exam, the incision on his knee is almost fully healed. There is no swelling. He can bend his knee from 10° to 105°. He has no pain or crackling in the knee.  \nIn his right foot, pressing on the toe bones does not hurt. He can lift his toes and ankle muscles with 4 out of 5 strength. He has reduced light‑touch sensation in the L4‑L5 area of both feet.  \nX‑rays of the right knee (front and side views) show the knee fracture is healed after the screw. X‑rays of the right foot (three views) show the broken second through fifth toe bones. They are not inside the joint (extraarticular). The bones are angled like a bayonet, but there is new bone (bridging callus) forming between the fragments on the angled view.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nFour months after the screw fixation of the right knee and the non‑operative treatment of the broken toe bones.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Keep doing physical therapy.  \n- He may put weight on his right leg as tolerated.  \n- Work on getting his knee to fully straighten and to bend more.  \n- Continue walking practice and strengthening exercises.  \n- Discussed his tingling symptoms. He has had left‑thigh tingling for years and is being followed by a neurologist. He now has right‑side tingling for several weeks but no other worsening symptoms. I told him I would contact his neurologist or possibly a spinal surgeon if his symptoms get worse.  \n- He should come back in 2 months for another visit and bring new X‑rays of the right knee (front and side) and the right foot (three views)."
