  "medical": "SUBJECTIVE: The patient comes back to see me today. She is a pleasant 73-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain, lumbar degenerative disc disease, lumbar spondylosis, facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis primarily bilateral recess, intermittent lower extremity radiculopathy, DJD of both knees, bilateral pes anserinus bursitis, and chronic pain syndrome. Dr. XYZ had performed right and left facet and sacroiliac joint injections, subsequent right L3 to S1 medial branch blocks and radiofrequency ablation on the right from L3 to S1. She was subsequently seen with some mid back pain and she had right T8-T9 and T9-T10 facet injections on 10/28/2004. She was last seen on 04/08/2005 with recurrent pain in her low back on the right. Dr. XYZ repeated her radiofrequency ablation on the right side from L3-S1 on 05/04/2005. The patient comes back to see me today. She states that the radiofrequency ablation has helped her significantly there, but she still has one spot in her low back that seems to be hurting her on the right, and seems to be pointing to her right sacroiliac joint. She is also complaining of pain in both knees. She says that 20 years ago she had a cortisone shot in her knees, which helped her significantly. She has not had any x-rays for quite some time. She is taking some Lortab 7.5 mg tablets, up to four daily, which help her with her pain symptoms. She is also taking Celebrex through Dr. S office. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essentially unchanged from my visit of 04/08/2005. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female. Vital Signs: Height is 5 feet 5 inches. Weight is 183 pounds. She is afebrile. HEENT: Benign. Neck: Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's. Musculoskeletal: Examination shows degenerative joint disease of both knees, with medial and lateral joint line tenderness, with tenderness at both pes anserine bursa. Straight leg raises are negative bilaterally. Posterior tibials are palpable bilaterally. Skin and Lymphatics: Examination of the skin does not reveal any additional scars, rashes, cafe au lait spots or ulcers. No significant lymphadenopathy noted. Spine: Examination shows decreased lumbar lordosis with tenderness that seems to be in her right sacroiliac joint. She has no other major tenderness. Spinal movements are limited but functional. Neurological: She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect. She has normal tone and coordination. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Sensation is intact to pinprick. FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it. IMPRESSION: 1. Low back syndrome with lumbar degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, and facet joint syndrome on the right L4-5 and L5-S1. 2. Improved, spinal right L3-S1 radiofrequency ablation. 3. Right sacroiliac joint sprain/strain, symptomatic. 4. Left lumbar facet joint syndrome, stable. 6. Right thoracic facet joint syndrome, stable. 7. Lumbar spinal stenosis, primarily lateral recess with intermittent lower extremity radiculopathy, stable. 8. Degenerative disc disease of both knees, symptomatic. 9. Pes anserinus bursitis, bilaterally symptomatic. 10. Chronic pain syndrome. RECOMMENDATIONS: Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology. She has some symptoms in her low back on the right side at the sacroiliac joint. Dr. XYZ will plan having her come in and injecting her right sacroiliac joint under fluoroscopy. She is also having pain in both knees. We will plan on x-rays of both knees, AP and lateral, and plan on seeing her back on Monday or Friday for possible intraarticular and/or pes anserine bursa injections bilaterally. I explained the rationale for each of these injections, possible complications and she wishes to proceed. In the interim, she can continue on Lortab and Celebrex. We will plan for the follow up following these interventions, sooner if needed. She voiced understanding and agreement. Physical exam findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.",
  "layman": "**Subjective:**  \nThe patient is a friendly 73‑year‑old white woman who came back to see me today. She had been treated by Dr. XYZ for a long list of back and knee problems: low back pain, worn‑down discs and joints in her lower spine, problems with the joints that connect the spine to the pelvis (sacroiliac joints), narrowing of the spinal canal on both sides, occasional nerve pain in her legs, arthritis in both knees, inflammation of the bursa near the inner knee (pes anserinus bursitis), and chronic pain.  \n\nDr. XYZ gave her injections into the right and left facet joints and sacroiliac joints, then blocked the nerves from L3 to S1 on the right side and performed radiofrequency ablation (RFA) there. She later had injections at T8‑T9 and T9‑T10 in the mid‑back. In April 2005 she had more back pain on the right, so Dr. XYZ repeated the RFA on the right side from L3‑S1 in May 2005.  \n\nToday the patient says the RFA helped a lot, but she still has a painful spot in her lower back on the right that seems to be coming from her right sacroiliac joint. She also has pain in both knees. She had a cortisone shot in each knee 20 years ago that helped a lot. She hasn’t had X‑rays in a long time. She takes up to four 7.5 mg Lortab tablets a day for pain and also takes Celebrex prescribed by Dr. S. Her past medical history is the same as it was in April 2005.  \n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **General:** Pleasant white woman.  \n- **Vitals:** Height 5′5″, weight 183 lb, no fever.  \n- **Head/Neck:** Normal. Neck moves well, no Spurling’s sign.  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Both knees show arthritis with tenderness on the inside and outside, and tenderness over the pes anserinus bursae. Straight‑leg raises are normal. The back of both calves feel normal.  \n- **Skin/Lymph:** No new scars, rashes, or lumps. No swollen lymph nodes.  \n- **Spine:** Less natural curve in the lower back, tenderness over the right sacroiliac joint. No other major tenderness. Spine moves well enough.  \n- **Neurologic:** Alert, oriented, normal mood. Normal muscle tone, coordination, reflexes, and sensation.  \n\n**Functional Exam:**  \nShe walks normally with no limping.  \n\n**Impression (diagnoses):**  \n1. Low back problems with worn‑down discs, spinal narrowing, and right‑side facet joint pain at L4‑5 and L5‑S1.  \n2. RFA on the right side from L3‑S1 has improved symptoms.  \n3. Right sacroiliac joint sprain/strain that is painful.  \n4. Left lumbar facet joint pain, stable.  \n5. Right thoracic facet joint pain, stable.  \n6. Spinal narrowing mainly on the sides with occasional leg nerve pain, stable.  \n7. Arthritis in both knees that is painful.  \n8. Pes anserinus bursitis on both sides that is painful.  \n9. Chronic pain syndrome.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \nDr. XYZ and I explained her conditions. She still has pain in her lower back on the right side at the sacroiliac joint. Dr. XYZ will schedule an injection into her right sacroiliac joint using imaging guidance. She also has knee pain, so we will get X‑rays of both knees (front and side views) and plan to see her again on Monday or Friday for possible injections into the knee joints and/or the pes anserinus bursae on both sides. I explained why we would do these injections, the possible risks, and she wants to proceed. In the meantime she can keep taking Lortab and Celebrex. We will follow up after these treatments, sooner if needed. She understood and agreed. The exam findings, history, and recommendations match what Dr. Goel found."
