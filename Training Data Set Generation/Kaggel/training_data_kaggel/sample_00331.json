  "medical": "CC: Headache. HX: The patient is an 8y/o RHM with a 2 year history of early morning headaches (3:00-6:00AM) intermittently relieved by vomiting only. He had been evaluated 2 years ago and an EEG was &quot;normal&quot; then, but no brain imaging was performed. His headaches progressively worsened, especially in the past two months prior to this presentation. For 2 weeks prior to his 1/25/93 evaluation at UIHC, he would awake screaming. His parent spoke with a local physician who thought this might be due to irritability secondary to pinworms and Vermox was prescribed and arrangements were made for a neurologic evaluation. On the evening of 1/24/93 the patient awoke screaming and began to vomit. This was followed by a 10 min period of tonic-clonic type movements and postictal lethargy. He was taken to a local ER and a brain CT revealed an intracranial mass. He was given Decadron and Phenytoin and transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. MEDS: noted above. PMH: 1)Born at 37.5 weeks gestation by uncomplicated vaginal delivery to a G1P0 mother. Pregnancy complicated by vaginal bleeding at 7 months. Met developmental milestones without difficulty. 2) Frequent otitis media, now resolved. 3) Immunizations were &quot;up to date.&quot; FHX: non-contributory. SHX: lives with biologic father and mother. No siblings. In 3rd grade (mainstream) and maintaining good marks in schools. EXAM: BP121/57mmHg HR103 RR16 36.9C MS: Sleepy, but cooperative. CN: EOM full and smooth. Advanced papilledema, OU. VFFTC. Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2. Right lower facial weakness. Tongue midline upon protrusion. Corneal reflexes intact bilaterally. Motor: 5/5 strength. Slightly increased muscle on right side. Sensory. No deficit to PP/VIB noted. Coord: normal FNF, HKS and RAM, bilaterally. Station: Mild truncal ataxia. Tends to fall backward. Reflexes: BUE 2+/2+, Patellar 3/3, Ankles 3+/3+ with 6 beats of nonsustained clonus bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: The patient was continued on Dilantin 200mg qd and Decadron 5mg IV q6hrs. Brain MRI, 1/26/93, revealed a large mass lesion in the region of the left caudate nucleus and thalamus which was hyperintense on T2 weighted images. There were areas of cystic formation at its periphery. The mass appeared to enhance on post gadolinium images. there was associated white matter edema and compression of the left lateral ventricle, and midline shift to the right. There was no sign of uncal herniation. He underwent bilateral VP shunting on 1/26/93; and then, subtotal resection (left frontal craniotomy with excision of the left caudate and thalamus with creation of an opening in the septum pellucidum) on 1/28/93. He then received 5040cGy of radiation therapy in 28 fractions completed on 3/25/93. A 3/20/95 neuropsychological evaluation revealed low average intellect on the WISC-III. There were also signs of memory, attention, reading and spelling deficits; and mild right-sided motor incoordination and mood variability. He remained in mainstream classes at school, but his physical and cognitive performance began to deteriorate in 4/95. Neurosurgical evaluation in 4/95 noted increased right hemiplegia and right homonymous hemianopia. MRI revealed tumor progression and he was subsequently placed on Carboplatin/VP-16 (CG 9933 protocol chemotherapy, regimen A). He was last seen on 4/96 and was having difficulty in the 6th grade; he was also undergoing physical therapy for his right hemiplegia.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Headache.  \n**History:** An 8‑year‑old boy with a 2‑year history of headaches that start early in the morning (between 3:00 and 6:00 AM). The headaches sometimes stop when he vomits. He was checked 2 years ago and an EEG was normal, but no brain scan was done. The headaches have gotten worse, especially in the last two months. For the two weeks before his visit on January 25, 1993, he would wake up screaming. His parent talked to a local doctor who thought the pain might be from pinworms, so the child was given Vermox and a neurologic evaluation was arranged. On the evening of January 24, 1993 he woke up screaming, vomited, then had a 10‑minute episode of stiff‑limb movements (a seizure) followed by feeling very sleepy. He was taken to a local emergency room where a brain CT scan showed an intracranial mass. He was given Decadron (a steroid) and Phenytoin (a seizure medication) and then transferred to UIHC for further care.  \n\n**Medications:** As noted above.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Born at 37.5 weeks by normal vaginal delivery. Mother had vaginal bleeding at 7 months. He reached developmental milestones normally.  \n2. Had frequent ear infections, now resolved.  \n3. All vaccines up to date.  \n\n**Family history:** Not significant.  \n\n**Social history:** Lives with both parents. No siblings. Attends 3rd grade in a regular school and does well academically.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 121/57 mmHg, heart rate 103, breathing 16, temperature 36.9 °C.  \n- He was sleepy but cooperative.  \n- Eye movements normal.  \n- Severe swelling of the optic discs in both eyes.  \n- Vision normal.  \n- Pupils equal and reactive.  \n- Weakness on the lower right side of his face.  \n- Tongue straight when sticking out.  \n- Cornea reflexes normal.  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 everywhere, slightly stronger on the right side.  \n- No sensory loss.  \n- Coordination normal.  \n- Mild balance problems; tends to fall backward.  \n- Reflexes normal in arms; knees 3/3, ankles 3+/3+ with brief clonus on both sides.  \n- General exam normal.  \n\n**Course of treatment:**  \nHe continued on Dilantin 200 mg once daily and Decadron 5 mg IV every 6 hours. An MRI on January 26, 1993 showed a large mass near the left caudate nucleus and thalamus that was bright on T2 images, had cystic areas around it, and enhanced after contrast. There was swelling of nearby white matter, compression of the left lateral ventricle, and a shift of the brain to the right, but no herniation. He had a bilateral ventriculoperitoneal shunt on January 26, then a partial removal of the tumor (left frontal craniotomy, removing the left caudate and thalamus and opening the septum pellucidum) on January 28. He received 5,040 cGy of radiation in 28 sessions, finished on March 25, 1993.  \n\nA neuropsychological test on March 20, 1995 showed average intelligence but problems with memory, attention, reading, spelling, mild right‑side motor coordination issues, and mood swings. He stayed in regular classes, but his physical and cognitive performance began to decline in April 1995. A neurosurgical review in April 1995 noted worsening right‑side weakness and loss of vision on the right side of his field. An MRI showed the tumor had grown, so he was started on Carboplatin/VP‑16 chemotherapy (CG 9933 protocol, regimen A). He was last seen in April 1996, struggling in 6th grade and receiving physical therapy for his right‑side weakness."
