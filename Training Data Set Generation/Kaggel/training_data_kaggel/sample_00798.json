  "layman": "**History of Present Illness**  \nThe patient came in for a follow‑up. He has erectile dysfunction and started taking Cialis 10 mg at his last visit. He says he has seen a little improvement and has had no side effects. With this dose he can get a firm erection that lasts about 10 minutes and allows him to penetrate. He reports no chest pain, no use of nitroglycerin, no fever or chills, and no painful urination or blood in the urine. He urinates every three hours during the day, does not wake up at night to urinate, and has a good stream.  \n\nHe has a history of a high PSA level. A biopsy in June of this year found high‑grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in the mid‑left lobe, but two of the biopsy samples were too small to evaluate. His PSA is 11.6. Dr. X’s notes were reviewed.  \n\n**Impression**  \n1. Some improvement of erectile dysfunction on a low dose of Cialis with no side effects. The patient has several risk factors but reports no heart problems or use of nitroglycerin. We discussed options such as increasing the Cialis dose, trying other medications, a penile prosthesis, Caverject injections, or a self‑inflating pump.  \n2. Elevated PSA with a recent biopsy showing high‑grade PIN and two inadequate samples. The patient has talked with his primary care doctor and is considering another prostate ultrasound and biopsy. He wants to meet with Dr. X first to discuss this before proceeding.  \n\n**Plan**  \nAfter a detailed discussion, the patient decided to increase Cialis to 20 mg. He was given samples and also given Levitra 10 mg, which could be increased to 20 mg. We reviewed how to use each drug, what they should not be taken with, and possible side effects. He was told not to use both drugs at the same time. He will call if he has any other concerns. He is scheduled to meet with Dr. X and will have a PSA checked again before a possible repeat ultrasound and biopsy. He declined scheduling the ultrasound/biopsy at this time. All questions were answered."
