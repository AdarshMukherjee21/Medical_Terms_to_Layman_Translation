  "medical": "CC: RLE weakness. HX: This 42y/o RHM was found 2/27/95 slumped over the steering wheel of the Fed Ex truck he was driving. He was cyanotic and pulseless according to witnesses. EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin. His blood pressure gradually improved and his balloon pump was discontinued on 5/5/95. Recovery was complicated by acute renal failure and liver failure. Initail CK=13,780, the CKMB fraction was normal at 0.8. On 3/10/95, the patient experienced CP and underwent cardiac catherization. This time he was found to have a single occlusion in the distal LAD with association inferior hypokinesis. Subsequent CK=1381 and CKMB=5.4 (elevated). The patient was amnestic to the event and for 10 days following the event. He was transferred to UIHC for cardiac electrophysiology study. MEDS: Nifedipine, ASA, Amiodarone, Capoten, Isordil, Tylenol, Darvocet prn, Reglan prn, Coumadin, KCL, SLNTG prn, CaCO3, Valium prn, Nubain prn. PMH: hypercholesterolemia. FHX: Father alive age 69 with h/o TIAs. Mother died age 62 and had CHF, A-Fib, CAD. Maternal Grandfather died of an MI and had h/o SVT. Maternal Grandmother had h/o SVT. SHX: Married, 7 children, driver for Fed Ex. Denied tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP112/74 HR64 RR16 Afebrile. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Euthymic with appropriate affect. CN: unremarkable. Motor: Hip flexion 3/5, Hip extension 5/5, Knee flexion5/5, Knee extension 2/5, Plantar flexion, extension, inversion and eversion 5/5. There was full strength thoughout BUE. Sensory: decreased PP/Vib/LT/TEMP about anterior aspect of thigh and leg in a femoral nerve distribution. Coord: poor and slowed HKS on right due to weakness. Station: no drift or Romberg sign. Gait: difficulty bearing weight on RLE. Reflexes: 1+/1+ throughout BUE. 0/2 patellae. 2/2 archilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. COURSE: MRI Pelvis, 3/28/95, revealed increased T1 weighted signal within the right iliopsoas suggestive of hematoma. An intra-osseous lipoma was incidentally notice in the right sacrum. Neuropsychologic assessment showed moderately compromised anterograde verbal memory, and temporal orientation and retrograde recall were below expectations. These findings were consistent with mesial temporal dysfunction secondary to anoxic injury and were mild in lieu of his history. He underwent implantation of a Medtronic internal cardiac difibrillator. His cardiac electrophysiology study found no inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He suffered mild to moderate permanent RLE weakness, especially involving the quadriceps. His femoral nerve compression had been present to long to warrant decompression. EMG/NCV studies revealed severe axonal degeneration.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: weakness in the right leg.  \n\nHistory: A 42‑year‑old FedEx driver was found on February 27, 1995, collapsed in front of the steering wheel of his truck. Witnesses said he was blue and had no pulse. EMTs saw he was in ventricular fibrillation and gave him epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium, and shocked him with a defibrillator. They also intubated him. When he arrived at the local emergency department his heart rhythm got worse. He needed more than nine shocks at 360 joules each, plus more epinephrine and lidocaine, but it didn’t help. Doctors then injected epinephrine directly into his heart and shocked him again, which put him into atrial fibrillation. He was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which showed his coronary arteries were normal. He was admitted to the ICU and needed an intra‑aortic balloon pump placed through the right groin. His blood pressure slowly improved and the pump was removed on May 5, 1995. His recovery was complicated by kidney and liver failure. Initial creatine kinase (CK) was 13,780 and the CK‑MB fraction was normal at 0.8. On March 10, 1995 he had chest pain and underwent another cardiac catheterization. This time a single blockage was found in the distal left anterior descending artery, with reduced movement of the lower heart wall. CK rose to 1,381 and CK‑MB to 5.4, indicating a heart injury. He didn’t remember the event and was also amnestic for the next ten days. He was transferred to UIHC for a cardiac electrophysiology study.  \n\nMedications: nifedipine, aspirin, amiodarone, capoten, isordil, Tylenol, Darvocet as needed, Reglan as needed, Coumadin, potassium chloride, SLNTG as needed, calcium carbonate, Valium as needed, and Nubain as needed.  \n\nPast medical history: high cholesterol.  \n\nFamily history: father alive at 69 with a history of TIAs; mother died at 62 with congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease; maternal grandfather died of a heart attack and had a history of supraventricular tachycardia; maternal grandmother had supraventricular tachycardia.  \n\nSocial history: married, has seven children, works as a FedEx driver, does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.  \n\nPhysical exam: blood pressure 112/74, heart rate 64, respiratory rate 16, no fever. He was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, and his mood was normal. Neurologic exam: motor strength – hip flexion 3/5, hip extension 5/5, knee flexion 5/5, knee extension 2/5, ankle movements 5/5. Upper‑extremity strength was normal. Sensation was decreased in the front of the thigh and leg, consistent with femoral nerve involvement. Coordination was poor and slow on the right hand due to weakness. He had no balance problems. He had difficulty walking on his right leg. Reflexes: 1+ in all upper‑extremity reflexes, 0/2 at the knees, 2/2 at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor on both sides.  \n\nCourse: An MRI of the pelvis on March 28, 1995 showed a hematoma in the right iliopsoas muscle. An incidental bone lipoma was found in the right sacrum. Neuropsychological testing showed moderate problems with new verbal memory, time orientation, and past recall, consistent with mild brain dysfunction after oxygen deprivation. He had a Medtronic internal cardiac defibrillator implanted. The electrophysiology study found no inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He has mild to moderate permanent weakness in his right leg, especially the quadriceps. The femoral nerve compression had been present too long to decompress. EMG/NCV studies showed severe axonal degeneration."
