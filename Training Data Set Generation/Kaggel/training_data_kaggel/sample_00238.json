  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: 1. Left endoscopic carpal tunnel release. 2. Endotracheal fasciotomy. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATION: The patient is a 62-year-old lady with the aforementioned diagnosis refractory to nonoperative management. All risks and benefits were explained. Questions answered. Options discussed. No guarantees were made. She wished to proceed with surgery. PROCEDURE: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion, the arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I made a transverse incision one fingerbreadth proximal to the distal volar wrist crease. Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion. Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis. I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally. I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area. Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side. Great care was taken with placement. A good plane was positively identified. I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament. Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me. I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament. I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified. I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament. I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament. I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect. I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time. Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut. Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut. Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin. The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.",

Endoscopic release of the left carpal tunnel.  \n2. Endoscopic forearm fasciotomy.  \n\nANESTHESIA: General.  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \n\nINDICATION: The patient is a 62‑year‑old woman whose left carpal tunnel syndrome did not improve with non‑surgical treatment. She was fully informed about the risks and benefits, asked questions, and chose to have the surgery.  \n\nPROCEDURE:  \nAfter giving the patient antibiotics and general anesthesia, the arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. The arm was emptied of blood with an Esmarch band and a tourniquet was set to 250 mmHg. A horizontal cut was made about one finger width above the wrist crease. The tissue was cut down to the forearm fascia, which was cut from the back side. A small electric cautery was used to stop bleeding. I then cut the forearm fascia near the elbow.  \n\nI entered the space under the outer layer of the wrist and used a probe and dilators to widen the area. I carefully felt the underside of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate bone on the inside of the wrist. I made sure the cut was in the right place. I inserted the endoscope and could see the layers of the ligament. I felt the hook of the hamate bone. With my thumb on the lower part of the ligament, I partially opened the blade and, starting 1 mm from the bottom edge, I cut the ligament. I then trimmed the lower half of the ligament completely. I checked the cut and then cut the upper part. I re‑entered the carpal tunnel and confirmed that the ligament was fully released – the two cut surfaces were separated and only one side was visible at a time. I made sure not to cut any long structures. Under direct view, I cut the lower forearm fascia. I then washed the area and closed the skin. The patient was dressed and taken to recovery in good condition."
