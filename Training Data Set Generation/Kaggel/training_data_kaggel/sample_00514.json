Talus bunion, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Third metatarsal osteotomy, right foot. 2. Talus bunionectomy, right foot. 3. Application of short-leg cast, right foot. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 31-year-old female presents to ABCD Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery on her painful right third plantar flex metatarsal. In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot. She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief. At this time she desires to attempt a surgical correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart. She was placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for retraction. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied. Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area. There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head. A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring. Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length. Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen. Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue. Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery. Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue. Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified. A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues. Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal. McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed. A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered. The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound. Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw. The metatarsal head was allowed to float. The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained. Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique. Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique. Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal. There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively. A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin. Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue. Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined. The abductor tendon was identified and retracted. A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone. The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade. Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis. A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences. The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline. #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues. #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture. Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique. Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head. A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head. The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa. The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied. Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits. A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee. Copious amounts of Webril were placed on all bony prominences. 3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape was used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast. One was able to insert two fingers to the distal and proximal aspects of the _cast. The capillary refill time to the digits was less than three seconds after cast application. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedures without complications. She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She was given standard postoperative instructions to rest, ice and elevate her right foot. She was counseled on smoking cessation. She was given Vicoprofen #30 1 p.o. q.4-6h p.r.n., pain. She was given Keflex #30 1 p.o. t.i.d. She is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday. She is to be full weightbearing with a cast boot. She was given emergency contact numbers to call us if problem arises.",
  "layman": "**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES**  \n1. The third metatarsal bone in the right foot is bent downward (plantar flexion).  \n2. A bunion (bony bump) on the talus bone in the right foot.  \n\n**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES**  \nThe same two conditions as listed above.  \n\n**PROCEDURE PERFORMED**  \n1. Cutting and realigning the third metatarsal bone in the right foot.  \n2. Removing the bunion on the talus bone in the right foot.  \n3. Putting a short‑leg cast on the right foot.  \n\n**ANESTHESIA**  \nGeneral anesthesia with a local injection.  \n\n**HISTORY**  \nA 31‑year‑old woman came to the pre‑operative area after not eating or drinking since midnight because she needed surgery for a painful bend in the third metatarsal bone in her right foot. She also has a painful bunion on the talus bone in the same foot. She has tried wide shoes, cleaning the area, and padding, but it didn’t help. She wants surgery. Dr. X explained the risks and benefits, and she gave consent.  \n\n**PROCEDURE IN DETAIL**  \n\n1. **Preparation** – An IV line was started and the patient was given general anesthesia. She was moved onto the operating table lying on her back. A safety strap was placed across her waist. The right ankle was washed with a large amount of Webril (a skin cleaner) and a pneumatic tourniquet was applied. After the patient was sedated, a 10‑cc mixture of local anesthetic (lidocaine, bupivacaine, and a steroid) was injected into the right foot. The foot was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. An Esmarch bandage was used to remove blood from the foot and the tourniquet was set to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered into the surgical field.  \n\n2. **Incision and scar removal** – The surgeon looked at the back of the third metatarsal. A thick, hard skin patch and a bent third metatarsal head were seen. A small scar from a previous surgery was also present. Using a #10 blade, a lazy‑S shaped incision about 3.5 cm long was made on the top of the third metatarsal. Two small, curved cuts were made over the scar, which was removed and sent for analysis. A #15 blade deepened the incision to the tissue under the skin. Small veins were tied off with electrocautery.  \n\n3. **Tendon and fascia work** – The long extensor tendon was gently pulled aside and any scar tissue was removed. The tendon was moved to the side and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was exposed. A straight cut to the bone was made with a #15 blade. The tissue covering the bone was lifted off the third metatarsal with a sharp blade. A special tool (McGlamry elevator) was used to free the head of the metatarsal and all the tight tissue on the bottom side. The third toe was bent downwards and the third metatarsal was brought into the wound.  \n\n4. **Osteotomy** – A V‑shaped cut with a saw was made, with the point of the V pointing downwards. The head of the metatarsal was left free. The wound was washed with lots of sterile saline. The tissue covering the bone was stitched with #3‑0 Vicryl (absorbable stitches) to keep the head in place. The skin under the stitches was closed with #4‑0 Vicryl (absorbable stitches) in a simple interrupted pattern. The skin was closed with #4‑0 nylon (non‑absorbable stitches) in a simple interrupted pattern.  \n\n5. **Fifth metatarsal work** – The surgeon then looked at the fifth metatarsal. A large, hard bump that was the main source of pain was seen. A #10 blade made a 3 cm incision through the skin. A #15 blade deepened the cut through the tissue under the skin. The sides of the incision were lifted. The abductor tendon was found and moved aside. A straight cut to the bone was made with a #15 blade. The bone was lifted off the surrounding tissue with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade. A saw removed the large bump on the top side of the bone. A rasp smoothened the bone edges. The wound was washed with saline. The tissue covering the bone was stitched with #3‑0 Vicryl. The skin under the stitches was closed with #4‑0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with #4‑0 nylon.  \n\n6. **Bursa removal** – The surgeon then examined the bottom side of the third metatarsal where a fluid sac (bursa) was felt under the bent metatarsal head. A small straight cut was made with a #15 blade under the head. The cut was deepened through the skin and the fluid sac was freed with curved hemostats and scissors. The wound was washed and two simple interrupted stitches with #4‑0 nylon were applied.  \n\n7. **Dressing and cast** – A standard postoperative dressing was applied: Xeroform, 4 × 4 gauze, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban. The tourniquet was released and the toes flushed with blood. A sterile stocking was placed on the toes just below the knee. Lots of Webril were applied to all bony bumps. 3‑inch and 4‑inch fiberglass cast tape were used to create a well‑padded, well‑molded cast that went below the knee. Two fingers could fit between the cast and the skin. The toes filled with blood in less than three seconds after the cast was applied.  \n\n**POSTOPERATIVE CARE**  \nThe patient tolerated the anesthesia and surgery without complications. She was moved to the recovery room with stable vital signs and good blood flow to the right foot. She was given standard postoperative instructions: rest, ice, and raise the right foot. She was advised to quit smoking. She was given Vicoprofen #30 (pain medication) 1 pill by mouth every 4‑6 hours as needed for pain. She was given Keflex #30 (antibiotic) 1 pill by mouth three times a day. She is to see Dr. X on Monday. She is allowed to walk on her feet with the cast boot. She was given emergency contact numbers to call if any problem occurs."
