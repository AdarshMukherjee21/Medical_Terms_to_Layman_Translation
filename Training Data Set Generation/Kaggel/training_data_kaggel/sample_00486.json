  "medical": "SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male that was last seen in clinic on 07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass. Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma. OBJECTIVE: The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15. Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact. Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities. Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception. Cerebellar exam is intact. Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes. Speech is appropriate. Judgment is intact. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing right temporal mass. Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme. We have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing. Given the high probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade glioma. The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor. He agrees that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night. He is sent for preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning. He has undergone vocational rehab assessment.",
  "layman": "**Subjective:**  \nThe patient is a 55‑year‑old African‑American man who first came to the clinic on July 29, 2008. He was diagnosed with new seizures and an MRI that showed a right‑side brain mass that lights up with contrast. Because of how the mass looks and his new seizures, doctors think it is likely a serious brain tumor called a high‑grade glioma.\n\n**Objective:**  \nThe patient is awake, fully aware of who he is, where he is, and what’s happening. His overall brain function score is 15 (normal). All his eye and facial nerves work well. He has full strength (5/5) in all four limbs. He can feel light touch, pain, temperature, and body position normally. His balance and coordination are fine. He walks normally and can walk heel‑to‑toe. His speech is clear. He can think and judge situations normally. His pupils are the same size and react to light.\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \nThe patient is a 55‑year‑old African‑American man with a new, contrast‑enhancing mass on the right side of his temporal lobe. The MRI suggests it is very likely a high‑grade glioma, possibly a glioblastoma multiforme. We talked in detail about the options: a biopsy, surgery to remove the tumor, medical treatment, chemotherapy, radiation, or no treatment. Because the tumor is almost certainly a high‑grade glioma, the patient decided, after considering the risks and benefits, to have a surgical biopsy and removal of the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and radiation. He has signed the consent for a right‑temporal brain surgery (craniotomy) to biopsy and likely remove the tumor. He agreed to be NPO (nothing by mouth) after midnight on Wednesday night. He will have a pre‑operative check‑up with anesthesia tomorrow morning. He has also had a vocational rehabilitation assessment."
