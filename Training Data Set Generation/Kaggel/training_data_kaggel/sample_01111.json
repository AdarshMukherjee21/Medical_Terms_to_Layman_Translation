  "medical": "CC: Delayed motor development. HX: This 21 month old male presented for delayed motor development, &quot;jaw quivering&quot; and &quot;lazy eye.&quot; He was an 8 pound 10 ounce product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy-labor-spontaneous vaginal delivery to a G3P3 married white female mother. There had been no known toxic intrauterine exposures. He had no serious illnesses or hospitalizations since birth. He sat independently at 7 months, stood at 11 months, crawled at 16 months, but did not cruise until 18 months. He currently cannot walk and easily falls. His gait is reportedly marked by left &quot;intoeing.&quot; His upper extremity strength and coordination reportedly appear quite normal and he is able to feed himself, throw and transfer objects easily. He knows greater than 20 words and speaks two-word phrases. No seizures or unusual behavior were reported except for &quot;quivering&quot; movement of his jaw. This has occurred since birth. In addition the parents have noted transient left exotropia. PMH: As above. FHX: Many family members with &quot;lazy eye.&quot; No other neurologic diseases declared. 9 and 5 year old sisters who are healthy. SHX: lives with parents and sisters. EXAM: BP83/67 HR122 36.4C Head circumference 48.0cm Weight 12.68kg (70%) Height 86.0cm (70%) MS: fairly cooperative. CN: Minimal transient esotropia OS. Tremulous quivering of jaw--increased with crying. No obvious papilledema, though difficult to evaluate due to patient movement. Motor: sat independently with normal posture and no truncal ataxia. symmetric and normal strength and muscle bulk throughout. Sensory: withdrew to vibration. Coordination: unremarkable in BUE. Station: no truncal ataxia. Gait: On attempting to walk, his right foot rotated laterally at almost 70degrees. Both lower extremities could rotate outward to 90degrees. There was marked passive eversion at the ankles as well. Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout. Musculoskeletal: pes planovalgus bilaterally. COURSE: CK normal. The parents decided to forego an MRI in 8/90. The patient returned 12/11/92 at age 4 years. He was ambulatory and able to run awkwardly. His general health had been good, but he showed signs developmental delay. Formal evaluation had tested his IQ at 87 at age 3.5 years. He was weakest on tasks requiring visual/motor integration and fine motor and visual discrimination skills. He was 6 months delayed in cognitive development at that time. On exam, age 4 years, he displayed mild right ankle laxity on eversion and inversion, but normal gait. The rest of the neurological exam was normal. Head circumference was 49.5cm (50%) and height and weight were in the 90th percentile. Fragile X analysis and karyotyping were unremarkable.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Slow motor development.\n\n**History:** A 21‑month‑old boy was brought in because he was moving slower than expected, his jaw was shaking, and he had a “lazy eye.” He was born at full term, weighing 8 lb 10 oz, with a normal pregnancy and vaginal delivery. There were no known harmful exposures in the womb. He has not had any serious illnesses or hospital stays since birth. He sat alone at 7 months, stood at 11 months, crawled at 16 months, and started walking at 18 months. He still can’t walk well and falls easily. His left foot tends to turn inward when he walks. His arms are strong and coordinated; he can feed himself, throw, and move objects. He knows more than 20 words and can say two‑word phrases. He has never had seizures or unusual behavior, except the jaw shaking, which has been present since birth. His parents also noticed that his left eye sometimes turns outward for a short time. Family history includes several relatives with “lazy eye.” His two sisters, ages 9 and 5, are healthy. He lives with his parents and sisters.\n\n**Physical exam (age 21 months):**  \n- Blood pressure 83/67 mm Hg, heart rate 122 bpm, temperature 36.4 °C.  \n- Head circumference 48.0 cm, weight 12.68 kg (70th percentile), height 86.0 cm (70th percentile).  \n- He was fairly cooperative.  \n- Vision: a brief inward turn of the left eye.  \n- Jaw: shaking, worse when crying. No obvious swelling of the optic nerve.  \n- Motor: sits alone with good posture, no balance problems. Strength and muscle size normal in all limbs.  \n- Sensory: responds to vibration.  \n- Coordination: normal in both arms.  \n- Gait: when he tried to walk, his right foot turned outward about 70°, both feet could turn outward up to 90°, and his ankles turned outward easily.  \n- Reflexes normal.  \n- Foot shape: flat feet on both sides.\n\n**Course:** Blood tests were normal. The parents chose not to get an MRI in August 1990. He returned for a follow‑up in December 1992 at age 4. He could walk and run, but still had some developmental delays. An IQ test at 3.5 years gave a score of 87. He was weakest in tasks that needed visual and motor coordination, fine motor skills, and visual discrimination. He was about six months behind in cognitive development at that time. At age 4, exam showed mild looseness in his right ankle when turning inward or outward, but his walking was normal. The rest of the neurological exam was normal. Head circumference 49.5 cm (50th percentile), height and weight were in the 90th percentile. Tests for Fragile X and a chromosome study were normal."
