  "medical": "DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Gastrointestinal bleed. DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE 1. Gastrointestinal bleed, source undetermined, but possibly due to internal hemorrhoids. 2. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 3. Hypothyroidism. PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. FINDINGS: Poor prep with friable internal hemorrhoids, but no gross lesions, no source of bleed. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room by Dr. X. He apparently had an NG tube placed in the emergency room with gastric aspirate revealing no blood. Dr. Y Miller saw him in consultation and recommended a colonoscopy. A bowel prep was done. H&Hs were stable. His most recent H&H was 38.6/13.2 that was this morning. His H&H at admission was 41/14.3. The patient had the bowel prep that revealed no significant bleeding. His vital signs are stable. He is continuing on his usual medications of Imdur, metoprolol, and Synthroid. His Plavix is discontinued. He is given IV Protonix. I am hesitant to use Prilosec or Protonix because of his history of pancreatitis associated with Prilosec. The patient's PT/INR was 1.03, PTT 25.8. Chemistry panel was unremarkable. The patient was given a regular diet after his colonoscopy today. He tolerated it well and is being discharged home. He will be followed closely as an outpatient. He will continue his Pepcid 40 mg at night, Imdur, Synthroid, and metoprolol as prior to admission. He will hold his Plavix for now. They will call me for further dark stools and will avoid Pepto-Bismol. They will follow up in the office on Thursday.",

Blood loss in the digestive tract – the exact source isn’t clear, but it may be from internal hemorrhoids.  \n2. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (hardening of the arteries).  \n3. Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).\n\n**PROCEDURE**  \nColonoscopy (a camera exam of the colon).\n\n**FINDINGS**  \nThe colon prep was not great. There were fragile internal hemorrhoids, but no obvious spots or clear source of bleeding.\n\n**HOSPITAL COURSE**  \nThe patient was taken to the emergency room by Dr. X. An NG tube was placed and the stomach fluid did not show blood. Dr. Y Miller saw him and suggested a colonoscopy. A bowel prep was done. His hemoglobin and hematocrit (H&H) were stable. The most recent H&H was 38.6/13.2 this morning; at admission it was 41/14.3. The bowel prep did not show significant bleeding. Vital signs stayed stable.  \n\nHe continues his usual medicines: Imdur (nitroglycerin), metoprolol (a beta‑blocker), and Synthroid (thyroid hormone). Plavix (a blood thinner) was stopped. He received IV Protonix (a stomach acid reducer). The doctor was cautious about using Prilosec or Protonix because of his history of pancreatitis linked to Prilosec.  \n\nBlood clotting tests were normal: PT/INR 1.03, PTT 25.8. Chemistry panel was normal. After the colonoscopy he was given a regular diet, which he tolerated well. He is being sent home.  \n\n**FOLLOW‑UP**  \nHe will be closely monitored as an outpatient. He will keep taking Pepcid 40 mg at night, Imdur, Synthroid, and metoprolol as before. Plavix will be held for now. If he has more dark stools, he should call the office and avoid Pepto‑Bismol. He will have a follow‑up appointment on Thursday."
