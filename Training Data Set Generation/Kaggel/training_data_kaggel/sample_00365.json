  "medical": "SUBJECTIVE: She is a 79-year-old female who came in with acute cholecystitis and underwent attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy 8 days ago. The patient has required conversion to an open procedure due to difficult anatomy. Her postoperative course has been lengthened due to a prolonged ileus, which resolved with tetracycline and Reglan. The patient is starting to improve, gain more strength. She is tolerating her regular diet. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Today, her temperature is 98.4, heart rate 84, respirations 20, and BP is 140/72. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. HEART: Regular rhythm and rate. ABDOMEN: Soft, less tender. LABORATORY DATA: Her white count continues to come down. Today, it is 11.6, H&H of 8.8 and 26.4, platelets 359,000. We have ordered type and cross for 2 units of packed red blood cells. If it drops below 25, she will receive a transfusion. Her electrolytes today show a glucose of 107, sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 103.2, bicarbonate 29.7. Her AST is 43, ALT is 223, her alkaline phosphatase is 214, and her bilirubin is less than 0.10. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: She had a bowel movement today and is continuing to improve. I anticipate another 3 days in the hospital for strengthening and continued TPN and resolution of elevated white count.",
  "layman": "SUBJECTIVE:  \nShe is a 79‑year‑old woman who had a sudden gallbladder infection (acute cholecystitis). Eight days ago she had a laparoscopic gallbladder removal, but the surgery had to be changed to an open procedure because the anatomy was difficult. Her recovery has been slower because she had a prolonged ileus (a temporary stopping of bowel movement), which improved after treatment with tetracycline and Reglan. She is now getting better, feeling stronger, and can eat her normal diet.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nVITAL SIGNS: Today her temperature is 98.4°F, heart rate 84 beats per minute, breathing 20 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 140/72 mm Hg.  \nLUNGS: Clear when listened to; no wheezes, crackles, or rattling sounds.  \nHEART: Regular rhythm and rate.  \nABDOMEN: Soft and less tender than before.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  \nHer white blood cell count is still going down. Today it is 11.6 k/µL. Hemoglobin is 8.8 g/dL and hematocrit 26.4%. Platelets are 359,000/µL. We have ordered a type and cross for 2 units of packed red blood cells; she will receive a transfusion if her hemoglobin drops below 25 g/dL. Electrolytes today: glucose 107 mg/dL, sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 4.0 mmol/L, chloride 103.2 mmol/L, bicarbonate 29.7 mmol/L. Liver enzymes: AST 43 U/L, ALT 223 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 214 U/L, and bilirubin less than 0.10 mg/dL.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \nShe had a bowel movement today and is continuing to improve. I expect she will need about 3 more days in the hospital for strengthening, ongoing total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and for her white blood cell count to return to normal."
