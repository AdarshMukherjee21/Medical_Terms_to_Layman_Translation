Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2). OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Left carpal tunnel release (64721). 2. Left ulnar nerve anterior submuscular transposition at the elbow (64718). 3. Lengthening of the flexor pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280). ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with intubation. INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE: This patient is insulin-dependant diabetic. He is also has end-stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis. Additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation. He has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity. However, it is our contention that this patient's prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger. These started initially as unrecognized paper cuts. Additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger. Finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger. Thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary. Thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of &quot;ping-pong ball sign&quot; due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers. However, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time. The patient has also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks. Thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve. This patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous Ancef. The entire left upper extremity is prepped with Betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion. A sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm. The arm is then exsanguinated with Ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease. Dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal. I next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm. Having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, I next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel. The synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so. There was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression. The motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified. The contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures. I next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle. Dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass. In the process of elevating this skin flap I elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap. I now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until I identified the median nerve. I turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and I dissected it all the way proximally until I encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm. The entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised. The ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures. Larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips. I continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the FCU muscle fibers. The nerve is now mobilized and I had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques. In this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner. I now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension-free manner. Because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other. So that in effect a lengthening is performed. Fascial repair is done with interrupted figure-of-eight 0-Ethibond sutures. I now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension-free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve. The entire arm is next wrapped with a Kerlix wrap and I released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, I then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis. Wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15-French Round Blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound. A layered wound closure is done with interrupted Vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular Monocryl to the skin. A 0.25% plain Marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of Adaptic impregnated Bacitracin ointment, followed by a well-fluffed gauze and a Kerlix dressing and confirming Kerlix and webril, and an above elbow sugar-tong splint is applied extending to the support of the wrist. Fingers and femoral were free to move. The splint is well padded with webril and is in turn held in place with Kerlix and Ace bandage. Meanwhile the patient is awakened and extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in good condition. Sponge and needle counts reported as correct at the end of the procedure.",

Lengthening of the flexor‑pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280).  \n\n**ANESTHESIA**  \nGeneral anesthesia with intubation.  \n\n**INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE**  \nThe patient is an insulin‑dependent diabetic who also has end‑stage kidney disease and is on chronic hemodialysis. He previously received a heart transplant. He has been evaluated for blood flow problems in both legs and possibly in the left arm. The main issue in the left arm appears to be nerve‑related ulcers on the little finger because the patient has no sensation there. These ulcers started as unnoticed paper cuts. The patient also reports pain mainly in the area served by the median nerve and the little finger.  \n\nHe has blockages in the left arm’s arteries: a short segment of the radial artery is blocked, and the ulnar artery is narrowed, but blood still reaches the hand and little finger. We plan to release the nerve entrapments first and consider artery surgery later if needed.  \n\nThe patient also has chronic finger problems with a “ping‑pong ball” appearance due to fat loss at the fingertips and occasional cracking and ulceration. There is no current sign of tissue death. He had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm that was turned off three weeks ago.  \n\nElectrodiagnostic studies showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the median nerve in the carpal tunnel.  \n\n**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE**  \n\nAfter the patient was put under general anesthesia and intubated, he was given IV antibiotics (Ancef). The entire left arm was cleaned with Betadine from the hand up to the armpit and covered with sterile drapes. A sterile tourniquet and a web‑like band (webril) were placed higher on the arm. The arm was drained of blood with an Ace bandage and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  \n\n**Carpal Tunnel Release**  \nI started with the carpal tunnel. A curved incision was made along the thumb side of the palm, stopping just before the wrist crease. I cut through the skin and fat to reach the palm’s thick tissue (palmar aponeurosis) and cut it lengthwise from the bottom up. Next I cut the transverse carpal ligament lengthwise from the bottom up, finishing the cut under direct vision in the lower forearm. After confirming the ligament was fully released, I examined the tunnel contents. The lining (synovium) was a bit thick but not severely so. The median nerve showed some redness, indicating long‑term pressure. I identified the motor branch of the median nerve. I pulled the tunnel contents toward the thumb side, checked the floor of the tunnel, and found no other compressive problems. The wound was washed with normal saline and the edges were stitched back together with interrupted 5‑0 nylon sutures.  \n\n**Ulnar Nerve Release and Transposition**  \nI then moved to the elbow. A curved incision was made on the inner side of the arm, extending into the forearm, passing between the elbow’s bony bump (olecranon) and the inner elbow bone (medial epicondyle). I cut through the fascia and lifted the skin flap to the fascia level over the flexor‑pronator muscle. While raising the flap, I also turned off the old shunt.  \n\nI exposed the outer edge of the flexor‑pronator muscle, cut along the outer side until I found the median nerve. I then focused on the ulnar nerve, which lies just behind the inner muscle wall in the upper arm. I dissected it all the way up until it crossed from the front to the back of the upper arm. I removed the entire inner muscle wall (medial intramuscular septum). I moved the ulnar nerve between vessel loops, taking care of its blood vessels. Large blood vessels feeding the muscle were tied off with clips. I continued to free the nerve around the inner elbow bone, cut the tissue between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and dissected the nerve between the muscle fibers. I kept the large muscle branches and pulled them into the muscle and up toward the nerve using small‑surgery techniques. This allowed the nerve to be moved safely in front of the flexor‑pronator muscle without tension.  \n\nI made an angled cut through the entire flexor‑pronator muscle near the forearm’s upper part, letting the muscle slide over itself. This effectively lengthened the muscle. I repaired the muscle fascia with interrupted figure‑of‑eight 0‑Ethibond sutures. I moved the arm through full flexion and extension; the nerve did not kink and the muscle covered the nerve without pressure.  \n\nI wrapped the arm with a Kerlix pad, released the tourniquet, and let the increased blood flow settle. I checked for bleeding, washed the wound with saline, and placed a 15‑French Round Blake drainage tube through a separate small incision along the wound. I closed the wound in layers: interrupted Vicryl under the skin, then a running subcuticular Monocryl on the skin. I injected 0.25% plain Marcaine around the wound edges for pain relief. I applied a dressing of Adaptic‑impregnated Bacitracin ointment, a well‑fluffed gauze, and a Kerlix pad. I secured the Kerlix and webril, and placed an above‑elbow sugar‑tong splint that reached the wrist. The fingers and forearm were free to move. The splint was padded with webril and held in place with Kerlix and an Ace bandage.  \n\nThe patient was awakened, taken off the breathing tube, and sent to recovery in good condition. All sponges and needles were counted correctly at the end of the procedure."
