  "medical": "PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was brought to the transesophageal echo laboratory after informed consent was obtained. The patient was seen by Anesthesia for MAC anesthesia. The patient's posterior pharynx was anesthetized with local Cetacaine spray. The transesophageal probe was introduced into the posterior pharynx and esophagus without difficulty. FINDINGS: 1. Left ventricle is normal in size and function; ejection fraction approximately 60%. 2. Right ventricle is normal in size and function. 3. Left atrium and right atrium are normal in size. 4. Mitral valve, aortic valve, tricuspid valve, and pulmonic valve with no evidence of vegetation. Aortic valve is only minimally thickened. 5. Mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. 6. No left ventricular thrombus. 7. No pericardial effusion. 8. There is evidence of patent foramen ovale by contrast study. The patient tolerated the procedure well and is sent to recovery in stable condition. He should be n.p.o. x4 hours, then liquid, then increase as tolerated. Once his infection is cleared, he should follow up with us with regard to followup of patent foramen ovale.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was taken to the echo lab after we explained and got his permission. Anesthesia checked him in for mild sedation. We sprayed local anesthetic (Cetacaine) in the back of his throat. The echo probe was passed into his throat and esophagus easily. FINDINGS: 1. The left ventricle is normal in size and works well; its ejection fraction is about 60%. 2. The right ventricle is normal in size and works well. 3. Both atria are normal in size. 4. All four heart valves (mitral, aortic, tricuspid, and pulmonary) show no growths; the aortic valve is only slightly thickened. 5. There is mild leaking (regurgitation) at the mitral and tricuspid valves. 6. No blood clot in the left ventricle. 7. No fluid around the heart. 8. A contrast study shows a patent foramen ovale (a small hole that should close after birth). The patient tolerated the test well and was sent to recovery in stable condition. He should not eat or drink for 4 hours, then start liquids, and gradually increase as tolerated. After his infection is cleared, he should come back for a follow‑up about the patent foramen ovale."
