  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy. PROCEDURE: Redo L4-5 diskectomy left. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANTIBIOTIC (S): Vancomycin given preoperatively. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. BLOOD REPLACED: None. CRYSTALLOID GIVEN: 800 mL. DRAIN (S): None. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the operating room in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. He was turned into the prone position on the operating table and positioned in the modified knee-chest position with Andrews frame being used. Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura. Closure was obtained with the lumbosacral fascia being reapproximated with #1, running, Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous closure was obtained in layers with 2-0, running, Vicryl suture. Skin closure was obtained with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular suture. Proxi-Strips and sterile dressing was applied. The skin had been infiltrated with 8 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine. After a sterile dressing was applied, the patient was turned into the supine position on the waiting recovery room stretcher, brought from under the effects of anesthesia, and taken to the recovery room.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis (English):** The patient had a recurring herniated disc at the L4‑5 level that was pressing on a nerve on the left side.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis (English):** The same recurring herniated disc at L4‑5 with left‑sided nerve pain.  \n\n**Procedure:** A repeat removal of the L4‑5 disc on the left side.  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**Antibiotics:** Vancomycin was given before the surgery.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia with a breathing tube.  \n\n**Estimated blood loss:** 10 mL.  \n**Blood replacement:** None.  \n**Crystalloid fluid given:** 800 mL.  \n**Drain:** None.  \n\n**Operation description:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room lying on his back. He was put under general anesthesia with a breathing tube. The table was turned so he lay on his stomach, and he was positioned in a modified knee‑chest position using an Andrews frame. Care was taken to protect pressure points.  \n\nThe back was shaved, cleaned with Betadine, rinsed with alcohol, and prepared with DuraPrep. The area was covered with sterile drapes, including an Ioban drape. A midline skin cut was made, and scar tissue from the previous surgery was removed. The surgeon cut through the fatty tissue with an electric cautery device.  \n\nThe outer layer of the spine (lumbosacral fascia) was split to the left of the spine’s midline. The surgeon carefully separated the bone of the spinous process and lamina, finding the area where the previous surgery had cut the bone. A cross‑table lateral view was used to confirm the position. The scar tissue was loosened from the lower part of the L4 lamina and the upper part of the L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. The dura (the outer covering of the spinal cord) was normal. The scar was freed from the inner wall. The dura and the nerve root were seen and protected with a nerve root retractor.  \n\nThe bulging disc fragment was still inside the long ligament that runs along the spine. A small cut was made with a Penfield knife, and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disc space was then entered with a cross‑shaped cut in the annulus (the outer ring of the disc), and more disc material was removed. When no more fragments could be taken out of the disc space, and no other fragments were found in the central canal under the long ligament, and a Murphy ball could pass through the opening without any blockage, the decompression was finished.  \n\nThe surgeon checked for any leaking fluid from the spinal cord and found none. There was no significant bleeding in the epidural space. The wound was washed with an antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo‑Medrol (a steroid) was placed over the dura and nerve root. A piece of fat from the surrounding tissue was then placed over the dura.  \n\nThe outer layer of the spine was stitched back together with a running #1 Vicryl suture. The fatty tissue was stitched in layers with a running 2‑0 Vicryl suture. The skin was closed with a 3‑0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch. Proxi‑Strips and a sterile dressing were applied. The skin was also numbed with 8 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  \n\nAfter the dressing was applied, the patient was turned back onto his back on a recovery room stretcher, taken out of anesthesia, and moved to the recovery room."
