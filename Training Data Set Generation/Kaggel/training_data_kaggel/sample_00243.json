  "medical": "CC: Left-sided weakness. HX: This 28y/o RHM was admitted to a local hospital on 6/30/95 for a 7 day history of fevers, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, urinary frequency, myalgias and generalized weakness. He denied foreign travel, IV drug abuse, homosexuality, recent dental work, or open wound. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Staphylococcus Aureus, oxacillin sensitive. He was place on appropriate antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity.. A 7/3/95 transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and a damaged mitral valve with regurgitation. Later that day he developed left-sided weakness and severe dysarthria and aphasia. HCT, on 7/3/95 revealed mild attenuated signal in the right hemisphere. On 7/4/95 he developed first degree AV block, and was transferred to UIHC. MEDS: Nafcillin 2gm IV q4hrs, Rifampin 600mg q12hrs, Gentamicin 130mg q12hrs. PMH: 1) Heart murmur dx age 5 years. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Employed cook. Denied ETOH/Tobacco/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP 123/54, HR 117, RR 16, 37.0C MS: Somnolent and arousable only by shaking and repetitive verbal commands. He could follow simple commands only. He nodded appropriately to questioning most of the time. Dysarthric speech with sparse verbal output. CN: Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Conjugate gaze preference toward the right. Right hemianopia by visual threat testing. Optic discs flat and no retinal hemorrhages or Roth spots were seen. Left lower facial weakness. Tongue deviated to the left. Weak gag response, bilaterally. Weak left corneal response. MOTOR: Dense left flaccid hemiplegia. SENSORY: Less responsive to PP on left. COORD: Unable to test. Station and Gait: Not tested. Reflexes: 2/3 throughout (more brisk on the left side). Left ankle clonus and a Left Babinski sign were present. GEN EXAM: Holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium. Janeway lesions were present in the feet and hands. No Osler's nodes were seen. COURSE: 7/6/95, HCT showed a large RMCA stroke with mass shift. His neurologic exam worsened and he was intubated, hyperventilated, and given IV Mannitol. He then underwent emergent left craniectomy and duraplasty. He tolerated the procedure well and his brain was allowed to swell. He then underwent mitral valve replacement on 7/11/95 with a St. Judes valve. His post-operative recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pericardial effusion and dysphagia. He required temporary PEG placement for feeding. The 7/27/95, 8/6/95 and 10/18/96 HCT scans show the chronologic neuroradiologic documentation of a large RMCA stroke. His 10/18/96 Neurosurgery Clinic visit noted that he can ambulate without assistance with the use of a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. His proximal LLE strength was rated at a 4. His LUE was plegic. He had a seizure 6 days prior to his 10/18/96 evaluation. This began as a Jacksonian march of shaking in the LUE; then involved the LLE. There was no LOC or tongue-biting. He did have urinary incontinence. He was placed on DPH. His speech was dysarthric but fluent. He appeared bright, alert and oriented in all spheres.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: weakness on the left side.  \n\nHistory: A 28‑year‑old man was admitted to a local hospital on June 30 1995 after having fever, chills, sweating, loss of appetite, frequent urination, muscle aches, and overall weakness for a week. He said he had not traveled abroad, used IV drugs, had recent dental work, or had any open wounds. Blood and urine tests grew Staphylococcus aureus that was sensitive to oxacillin. He was started on the appropriate antibiotics.  \n\nOn July 3 a heart ultrasound showed normal pumping but a damaged mitral valve leaking. That same day he developed left‑side weakness, trouble speaking (dysarthria), and trouble understanding language (aphasia). A head CT on July 3 showed a small abnormal area in the right side of the brain. On July 4 he developed a first‑degree heart block and was transferred to the University of Illinois Hospital.  \n\nMedications:  \n- Nafcillin 2 g IV every 4 hours  \n- Rifampin 600 mg every 12 hours  \n- Gentamicin 130 mg every 12 hours  \n\nPast medical history: heart murmur diagnosed at age 5.  \nFamily history: nothing notable.  \nSocial history: works as a cook, does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illegal drugs.  \n\nPhysical exam (July 3):  \n- Blood pressure 123/54, heart rate 117, breathing 16, temperature 37.0 °C.  \n- Mental status: sleepy, only woke up when shaken or spoken to repeatedly. He could follow simple instructions and nodded most of the time. Speech was slurred and he spoke little.  \n- Cranial nerves: pupils 3 mm, equal, and got smaller to 2 mm when light was shone. He tended to look to the right. He could not see the right side of his vision. Eye discs were normal, no eye bleeding or spots.  \n- Facial weakness on the lower left side. Tongue turned left. Gag reflex weak on both sides. Left eye blink reflex weak.  \n- Motor: complete flaccid paralysis on the left side.  \n- Sensory: less feeling on the left.  \n- Coordination could not be tested. Standing and walking were not tested.  \n- Reflexes 2/3 on all limbs, a bit stronger on the left. Left ankle clonus and a positive Babinski sign were seen.  \n- General exam: a loud heart murmur heard all through the chest. Small red spots on the feet and hands (Janeway lesions). No painful bumps on the fingers (Osler nodes).  \n\nCourse:  \nOn July 6, 1995 a head CT showed a large stroke in the right middle cerebral artery area with brain swelling. His neurological condition worsened, so he was put on a breathing machine, given extra oxygen, and received IV mannitol. He then had emergency surgery to remove part of the skull on the left side and repair the dura (craniectomy and duraplasty). He tolerated the surgery and the brain was allowed to swell.  \n\nOn July 11 he had a mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude valve. After surgery he developed pneumonia, fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion), and trouble swallowing (dysphagia). A feeding tube (PEG) was placed temporarily.  \n\nCT scans on July 27, August 6, and October 18, 1996 documented the large stroke.  \n\nAt a neurosurgery clinic visit on October 18, 1996 he could walk without help if he used a leg brace to stop his left foot from dropping. His upper left arm was still paralyzed. His left leg had a strength score of 4 out of 5. Six days before the clinic visit he had a seizure that began with shaking in the left arm and then spread to the left leg. He did not lose consciousness or bite his tongue, but he did have urinary incontinence. He was started on DPH. His speech was slurred but he could speak. He was alert, oriented, and seemed bright."
