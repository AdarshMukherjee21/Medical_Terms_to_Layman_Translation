  "medical": "NUCLEAR MEDICINE HEPATOBILIARY SCAN REASON FOR EXAM: Right upper quadrant pain. COMPARISONS: CT of the abdomen dated 02/13/09 and ultrasound of the abdomen dated 02/13/09. Radiopharmaceutical 6.9 mCi of Technetium-99m Choletec. FINDINGS: Imaging obtained up to 30 minutes after the injection of radiopharmaceutical shows a normal hepatobiliary transfer time. There is normal accumulation within the gallbladder. After the injection of 2.1 mcg of intravenous cholecystic _______, the gallbladder ejection fraction at 30 minutes was calculated to be 32% (normal is greater than 35%). The patient experienced 2/10 pain at 5 minutes after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical and the patient also complained of nausea. IMPRESSION: 1. Negative for acute cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction. 2. Gallbladder ejection fraction just under the lower limits of normal at 32% that can be seen with very mild chronic cholecystitis.",

Images were taken up to 30 minutes after injection.\n\n**Findings:**  \n- The liver and bile ducts worked normally and the gallbladder filled normally.  \n- After giving 2.1 mcg of a drug that stimulates the gallbladder, the gallbladder ejection fraction (how well it empties) at 30 minutes was 32%. Normal is over 35%.  \n- The patient felt pain rated 2 out of 10 five minutes after the injection and also felt nauseous.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. No evidence of acute gallbladder inflammation or blockage of the cystic duct.  \n2. The gallbladder ejection fraction is just below normal (32%) and can be seen with very mild chronic gallbladder inflammation."
