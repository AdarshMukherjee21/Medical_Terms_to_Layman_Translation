  "medical": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: Urinary retention. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66-year-old gentleman status post deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07, who has had recurrent urinary retention issues since that time. Most recently, he was hospitalized on 02/04/08 for acute renal insufficiency, which was probably secondary to dehydration. He was seen by urology again at this visit for urinary retention. He had been seen by urology during a previous hospitalization and he passed his voiding trial at the time of his stent removal on 01/22/08. Cystoscopy showed at that time obstructive BPH. He was started on Flomax at the time of discharge from the hospital. During the most recent readmission on 02/04/08, he went back into urinary retention and he had had a Foley placed at the outside hospital. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for blurred vision, nasal congestion, and occasional constipation. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath or any rashes or lesions. All other systems were reviewed and found to be negative. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. End-stage renal disease, now status post deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07. 2. Hypertension. 3. History of nephrolithiasis. 4. Gout. 5. BPH. 6. DJD. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07. 2. Left forearm and left upper arm fistula placements. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother with an unknown type of cancer, possibly colon cancer or lung and prostate problems on his father side of the family. He does not know whether his father side of the family had any history of prostate cancer. HOME MEDICATIONS: 1. Norvasc. 2. Toprol 50 mg. 3. Clonidine 0.2 mg. 4. Hydralazine. 5. Flomax. 6. Allopurinol. 7. Sodium bicarbonate. 8. Oxybutynin. 9. Coumadin. 10. Aspirin. 11. Insulin 70/30. 12. Omeprazole. 13. Rapamune. 14. CellCept. 15. Prednisone. 16. Ganciclovir. 17. Nystatin swish and swallow. 18. Dapsone. 19. Finasteride. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: This is a well-developed, well-nourished male, in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98, blood pressure 129/72, pulse 96, and weight 175.4 pounds. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur. ABDOMEN: Right lower quadrant incision site scar well healed. Nontender to palpation. Liver and spleen not enlarged. No hernias appreciated. PENIS: Normal male genitalia. No lesions appreciated on the penis. Previous DRE showed the prostate of approximately 40 grams and no nodules. Foley in place and draining clear urine. The patient underwent fill and pull study, in which his bladder tolerated 120 ml of sterile water passively filling his bladder. He spontaneously voided without the Foley 110 mL. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 66-year-old male with signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, who has had recurrent urinary retention since the kidney transplant in 12/07. He passed his fill and pull study and was thought to self-catheterize in the event that he does incur urinary retention again. We discussed with Mr. Barker that he has a urologist closer to his home and he lives approximately 3 hours away; however, he desires to continue follow up with the urology clinic at MCG and has been set up for followup in 6 weeks. He was also given a prescription for 6 months of Flomax and Proscar. He did not have a PSA drawn today as he had a catheter in place, therefore his PSA could be falsely elevated. He will have PSA level drawn either just before his visit for followup.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Trouble staying dry – he can’t empty his bladder.\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nA 66‑year‑old man had a kidney transplant from a deceased donor in December 2007. Since then he has had repeated episodes of urinary retention (not being able to pee). The most recent episode was in February 2008 when he was admitted for low kidney function, probably because he was dehydrated. He was seen by a urologist again and had a catheter placed. Earlier that year, after a stent was removed on January 22, he passed a voiding test. A cystoscopy then showed that an enlarged prostate was blocking his bladder. He was started on Flomax (tamsulosin) when he left the hospital. During the February 2008 readmission he again could not pee and a Foley catheter was inserted at the outside hospital.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \nHe reports blurred vision, a stuffy nose, and occasional constipation. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, rashes, or skin lesions. All other systems are normal.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1. End‑stage kidney disease, now with a transplanted kidney.  \n2. High blood pressure.  \n3. History of kidney stones.  \n4. Gout.  \n5. Enlarged prostate (BPH).  \n6. Degenerative joint disease.\n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n1. Kidney transplant (Dec 2007).  \n2. Left forearm and upper arm fistula placements.\n\n**Family History:**  \nMother had an unknown cancer, possibly colon or lung cancer. Father’s side has prostate problems, but it’s unclear if there was prostate cancer.\n\n**Home Medications:**  \n- Norvasc (amlodipine)  \n- Toprol 50 mg (metoprolol)  \n- Clonidine 0.2 mg  \n- Hydralazine  \n- Flomax (tamsulosin)  \n- Allopurinol  \n- Sodium bicarbonate  \n- Oxybutynin  \n- Coumadin (warfarin)  \n- Aspirin  \n- Insulin 70/30  \n- Omeprazole  \n- Rapamune (sirolimus)  \n- CellCept (mycophenolate)  \n- Prednisone  \n- Ganciclovir  \n- Nystatin swish‑and‑swallow  \n- Dapsone  \n- Finasteride\n\n**Allergies:** None known.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **General:** Healthy‑looking man, not in distress.  \n- **Vitals:** Temperature 98 °F, BP 129/72, pulse 96, weight 175.4 lb.  \n- **Lungs:** Clear.  \n- **Heart:** Regular rhythm, 3/6 systolic murmur.  \n- **Abdomen:** Scar from kidney transplant incision is healed, no tenderness, liver and spleen normal, no hernias.  \n- **Genitals:** Normal penis, no lesions. Previous digital rectal exam showed a 40‑gram prostate with no lumps.  \n- **Catheter:** Foley in place, draining clear urine.  \n- **Bladder test:** He tolerated 120 ml of sterile water in his bladder and then voluntarily peed 110 ml after the catheter was removed.\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**  \nThe patient has an enlarged prostate that has caused repeated urinary retention since his transplant. He passed the bladder test and may need to self‑catheter if he has another episode. He prefers to keep seeing the urology clinic at MCG even though a closer doctor exists; a follow‑up appointment is scheduled in six weeks. He was given a six‑month supply of Flomax and Proscar (finasteride). A PSA test was not done today because the catheter could give a false high reading; it will be drawn before his next visit."
