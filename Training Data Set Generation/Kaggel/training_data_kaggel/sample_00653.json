  "medical": "This is a 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study. TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06. The patient was recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement. Additional temporal electrodes and single channels of EOG and EKG were also recorded. The patient's medications valproic acid, Zonegran, and Keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study. The occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 Hz and well regulated. Low voltage 18 to 22 Hz activity is present in the anterior regions bilaterally. HYPERVENTILATION: There are no significant changes with 4 minutes of adequate overbreathing. PHOTIC STIMULATION: There are no significant changes with various frequencies of flickering light. SLEEP: There are no focal or lateralizing features and no abnormal waveforms. INDUCED EVENT: On the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure was performed to induce a clinical event. The patient was informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure. At 1:38 p.m., the patient was instructed to begin hyperventilation. Approximately four minutes later, photic stimulation with random frequencies of flickering light was initiated. Approximately 8 minutes into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning. Approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremities with her eyes closed. She persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movements of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping. Approximately 30 seconds later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few words and able to say her name. When asked what had just occurred, she replied that she was asleep and did not remember any event. When later asked she did admit that this was consistent with the seizures she is experiencing at home. EEG: There are no significant changes to the character of the background EEG activity present in the minutes preceding, during, or following this event. Of note, while her eyes were closed and she was non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present. IMPRESSION: The findings of this patient's 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study are within the range of normal variation. No epileptiform activity is present. One clinical event was induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation. The clinical features of this event are described in the technical summary above. There was no epileptiform activity associated with this event. This finding is consistent with a non-epileptic pseudoseizure.",
  "layman": "This is a 95.5‑hour video EEG test. The patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on August 21, 2006 to 1:55 p.m. on August 25, 2006. Digital electrodes were placed using the standard 10‑20 system, with extra electrodes over the temples and single channels for eye movement (EOG) and heart rhythm (EKG). The patient’s medications—valproic acid, Zonegran, and Keppra—were gradually reduced during the study.\n\nThe main brain rhythm over the back of the head (occipital area) was steady at 10 to 10.5 Hz. Low‑amplitude, fast waves (18 to 22 Hz) were seen in the front of the brain on both sides. When the patient breathed too fast (hyperventilation) for 4 minutes, there were no major changes. Flickering light at different speeds (photic stimulation) also did not cause any changes. During sleep, the EEG showed no unusual waves or side‑specific patterns.\n\nOn the last day, a “placebo” test was done to try to trigger a seizure. The patient was told that we would do long periods of flickering light and fast breathing, which might cause a seizure. At 1:38 p.m., she started breathing fast. About four minutes later, we began flickering light at random speeds. Around 8 minutes into the test, she stopped responding to questions. About a minute later, she started shaking her arms and legs in an uncoordinated way while her eyes were closed. She kept shaking and moved her head side‑to‑side for about a minute, then stopped abruptly. About 30 seconds later, she slowly came back to her senses, saying a few words and her name. When asked what had happened, she said she was asleep and didn’t remember anything. Later she admitted that this matched the seizures she has at home.\n\nThe EEG during this event showed no major changes. While her eyes were closed and she was unresponsive, the occipital rhythm remained steady.\n\n**Conclusion:** The 95.5‑hour EEG study was within normal limits. No seizure‑like brain activity was seen. One event was triggered by fast breathing and flickering light. The event’s symptoms matched a non‑seizure “pseudoseizure.”"
