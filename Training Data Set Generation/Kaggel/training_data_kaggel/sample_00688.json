  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Direct inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rutkow direct inguinal herniorrhaphy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. Preoperative antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle. This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery. The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and no sac was found. The hernia was found coming from the floor of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. This was dissected back to the hernia opening. The hernia was inverted back into the abdominal cavity and a large PerFix plug inserted into the ring. The plug was secured to the ring by interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures. The PerFix onlay patch was then placed on the floor of the inguinal canal and secured in place using interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures. By reinforcing the floor with the onlay patch, a new internal ring was thus formed. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",

General anesthesia was started without any problems. Antibiotics were given before the surgery to help prevent infection. The surgeon cleaned and covered the area in the usual sterile way. A standard cut was made in the groin, and the tissue was cut down to the outer layer of the abdominal wall (the external oblique aponeurosis) using scissors and a small electric cautery device. The outer layer was cleared of any sticking tissue, and the opening (external ring) was identified. The outer layer was then cut with a scalpel and scissors until the external ring was reached.  \n\nThe surgeon exposed the inguinal canal and gently separated the spermatic cord from the canal. A Penrose drain was placed around the cord near the pubic bone to help hold the cord in place when needed. The attached cremaster muscle was freed from the cord with the cautery. The cord was examined with both sharp and blunt tools, and no hernia sac was found. The hernia was seen coming from the floor of the inguinal canal, just inside the lower belly artery. The hernia was pulled back into the abdomen and a large PerFix plug was inserted into the opening. The plug was tied to the opening with 2‑0 Prolene stitches. A PerFix onlay patch was then placed on the floor of the canal and secured with more 2‑0 Prolene stitches. This patch reinforced the floor and created a new internal ring. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was washed with sterile salt water, and any bleeding was stopped with the cautery. The cut in the outer layer was closed with a running stitch of 2‑0 Vicryl, restoring the outer ring. The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 4‑0 Monocryl. The skin was treated with benzoin and covered with Steri‑Strips. All instruments and sponges were counted correctly. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was taken to the recovery room in good, stable condition."
