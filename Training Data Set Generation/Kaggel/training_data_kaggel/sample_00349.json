  "medical": "PROCEDURE: A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram was performed on a patient in the awake state. Per the technician's notes, the patient is taking Depakene. The recording consists of symmetric 9 Hz alpha activity. Throughout the recording, repetitive episodes of bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity are noted. The episodes last from approximately1 to 7 seconds. The episodes are exacerbated by hyperventilation. IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram with repetitive bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity exacerbated by hyperventilation. This activity could represent true petit mal epilepsy. Clinical correlation is suggested.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURE: A 21‑lead digital EEG was done while the patient was awake. The technician noted that the patient is taking Depakene. The EEG shows normal 9‑Hz alpha waves. During the test, there were repeated bursts of spike‑and‑wave activity that occurred three times per second. Each burst lasted about 1 to 7 seconds and got worse when the patient breathed too fast.  \n\nIMPRESSION: The EEG is abnormal because of these repeated 3‑per‑second spike‑and‑wave bursts that get worse with rapid breathing. This pattern could be a sign of petit mal (absence) epilepsy. A doctor should look at the patient’s symptoms to confirm."
