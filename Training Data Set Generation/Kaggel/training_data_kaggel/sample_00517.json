  "medical": "CC: Stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision. HX: This 72y/o woman was diagnosed with a left sphenoid wing meningioma on 6/3/80. She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and &quot;complete resection&quot; of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma. The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** She has a stable language problem (expressive aphasia) and reduced vision.  \n\n**History:**  \n- In 1980, when she was 59, she was diagnosed with a meningioma (a type of brain tumor) on the left side of the sphenoid wing. She had been feeling more irritable and had headaches for six months. A month before she saw a doctor she started turning her head to the left, and three days before she had a severe speech difficulty.  \n- A CT scan showed a bright, uniform tumor on the left sphenoid wing. X‑rays of the skull showed the pineal gland was shifted to the right.  \n- She was moved to UIHC where a neurologic exam was normal. Angiography (blood vessel imaging) showed the tumor was very vascular.  \n- She had a left temporal craniotomy (surgery to remove the tumor) and the surgeon removed the tumor completely. Pathology confirmed it was a meningioma.  \n- The tumor returned and was removed again on September 25, 1984. It grew again, seen on a CT in 1985.  \n- A CT in June 1988 showed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma.  \n- A CT in 1989 showed tumors in the left temporal/sphenoid area, left tentorial area, and a new left frontal area.  \n- On February 14, 1991 she felt more tired and had trouble concentrating. A CT that day showed the left frontal meningioma was larger and had more swelling. She had surgery on February 25, 1991 to remove the left frontal and temporal tumors.  \n- The tumors came back and a new left parietal tumor appeared. She had another surgery on November 21, 1991 to remove the left frontal tumor because she had right‑side weakness and speech problems. The weakness improved a bit, and her speech got better but never fully returned to normal.  \n- In May 1992 she had three tonic‑clonic seizures. Each started with a Jacksonian march (muscle jerks) up the right leg, then right arm, before spreading to the whole body. She had been on phenobarbital since her 1980 surgery; the dose was increased.  \n- On December 7, 1992 she had a large craniotomy (left fronto‑temporo‑parieto‑occipital) and removal of five meningiomas. After surgery she had worse right‑side weakness and speech problems. By March 1993 the weakness and speech improved, but they never returned to normal."
