  "medical": "CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Evaluate for retroperitoneal hematoma, the patient has been following, is currently on Coumadin. CT ABDOMEN: There is no evidence for a retroperitoneal hematoma. The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are unremarkable. Within the superior pole of the left kidney, there is a 3.9 cm cystic lesion. A 3.3 cm cystic lesion is also seen within the inferior pole of the left kidney. No calcifications are noted. The kidneys are small bilaterally. CT PELVIS: Evaluation of the bladder is limited due to the presence of a Foley catheter, the bladder is nondistended. The large and small bowels are normal in course and caliber. There is no obstruction. Bibasilar pleural effusions are noted. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for retroperitoneal bleed. 2. There are two left-sided cystic lesions within the kidney, correlation with a postcontrast study versus further characterization with an ultrasound is advised as the cystic lesions appear slightly larger as compared to the prior exam. 3. The kidneys are small in size bilaterally. 4. Bibasilar pleural effusions.",
  "layman": "CT abdomen and pelvis were done without contrast to look for a hidden blood collection behind the organs. The patient has been monitored and is taking Coumadin.\n\n**Abdomen scan:**  \n- No hidden blood collection was found.  \n- Liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas look normal.  \n- Two cysts were found in the left kidney: one 3.9 cm in the upper part and another 3.3 cm in the lower part. No calcium deposits are seen.  \n- Both kidneys are smaller than usual.\n\n**Pelvis scan:**  \n- The bladder could not be fully examined because a catheter is in place, but it is not swollen.  \n- The large and small intestines are in the right place and have normal size.  \n- There is no blockage in the intestines.  \n- Small fluid collections are seen at the lower parts of both lungs.\n\n**Summary:**  \n1. No hidden blood collection behind the organs.  \n2. Two cysts in the left kidney; they appear slightly larger than on the previous scan. A contrast study or ultrasound is recommended for better evaluation.  \n3. Both kidneys are small.  \n4. Small fluid collections at the lower lungs."
