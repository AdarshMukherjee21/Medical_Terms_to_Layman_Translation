  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female with low back pain radiating down the left leg and foot for one and a half years. FINDINGS: High resolution computerized tomography was performed from T12-L1 to the S1 level with reformatted images in the sagittal and coronal planes and 3D reconstructions performed. COMPARISON: Previous MRI examination 10/13/2004. There is minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex to the left. T12-L1, L1-2, L2-3: There is normal disc height with no posterior annular disc bulging or protrusion. Normal central canal, intervertebral neural foramina and facet joints. L3-4: There is normal disc height and non-compressive circumferential annular disc bulging eccentrically greater to the left. Normal central canal and facet joints (image #255). L4-5: There is normal disc height, circumferential annular disc bulging, left L5 hemilaminectomy and posterior central/right paramedian broad-based disc protrusion measuring 4mm (AP) contouring the rightward aspect of the thecal sac. Orthopedic hardware is noted posteriorly at the L5 level. Normal central canal, facet joints and intervertebral neural foramina (image #58). L5-S1: There is minimal decreased disc height, postsurgical change with intervertebral disc spacer, posterior lateral orthopedic hardware with bilateral pedicle screws in good postsurgical position. The orthopedic hardware creates mild streak artifact which mildly degrades images. There is a laminectomy defect, spondylolisthesis with 3.5mm of anterolisthesis of L5, posterior annular disc bulging greatest in the left foraminal region lying adjacent to the exiting left L5 nerve root. There is fusion of the facet joints, normal central canal and right neural foramen (image #69-70, 135). There is no bony destructive change noted. There is no perivertebral soft tissue abnormality. There is minimal to mild arteriosclerotic vascular calcifications noted in the abdominal aorta and right proximal common iliac artery. IMPRESSION: Minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex to the left. L3-4 posterior non-compressive annular disc bulging eccentrically greater to the left. L4-5 circumferential annular disc bulging, non-compressive central/right paramedian disc protrusion, left L5 laminectomy. L5-S1 postsurgical change with posterolateral orthopedic fusion hardware in good postsurgical position, intervertebral disc spacer, spondylolisthesis, laminectomy defect, posterior annular disc bulging greatest in the left foraminal region adjacent to the exiting left L5 nerve root with questionable neural impingement. Minimal to mild arteriosclerotic vascular calcifications.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged woman who has had lower back pain that shoots down her left leg and foot for about 18 months.  \n\n**Findings**  \nA high‑resolution CT scan was taken from the lower thoracic spine (T12‑L1) down to the first sacral vertebra (S1). The images were reformatted in side‑view (sagittal) and front‑view (coronal) planes and also shown in 3‑D.  \n\n**Comparison**  \nThe scan was compared with an MRI done on 10/13/2004.  \n\n**Spine**  \n- The lower back has a very slight curve that bends to the left.  \n- At the levels T12‑L1, L1‑2, and L2‑3 the discs look normal, with no bulging or protrusion of the disc material. The spinal canal, the openings where nerves exit (foramina), and the joint surfaces (facet joints) are all normal.  \n- At L3‑4 the disc height is normal, but there is a small, non‑compressing bulge of the disc that is more pronounced on the left side. The canal and facet joints are normal.  \n- At L4‑5 the disc height is normal. There is a small, round bulge of the disc around the whole circumference, and a larger bulge that sits on the right side of the spinal canal, measuring about 4 mm from front to back. This bulge is next to the right side of the spinal cord. A surgical screw (left L5 hemilaminectomy) and other hardware are present behind the L5 vertebra. The canal, facet joints, and nerve openings are normal.  \n- At L5‑S1 the disc height is slightly reduced. This area has been operated on: a disc spacer was inserted, and a fusion device with screws on both sides is in good position. The hardware causes a little streaking on the images. There is a small defect where the back part of the vertebra was removed (laminectomy). The L5 vertebra has slipped forward about 3.5 mm (spondylolisthesis). A bulge of the disc is most noticeable on the left side, right next to the left L5 nerve root. The joint surfaces at this level are fused. The spinal canal and the right nerve opening are normal. No bone damage or abnormal soft tissue is seen.  \n\n**Other findings**  \nThere are mild calcifications (hardening) in the abdominal aorta and the right common iliac artery, indicating some arteriosclerosis.  \n\n**Impression**  \n- Slight left‑bending curve of the lower back.  \n- Small, non‑compressing disc bulge at L3‑4, more on the left.  \n- Small, round disc bulge around L4‑5 and a larger bulge on the right side of the canal, with a left‑side surgical removal of part of L5.  \n- At L5‑S1, post‑surgical changes with fusion hardware in good place, a disc spacer, a small forward slip of L5, a defect from the removed back part of the vertebra, and a disc bulge on the left near the exiting nerve root that may be pressing on the nerve.  \n- Mild arteriosclerotic calcifications."
