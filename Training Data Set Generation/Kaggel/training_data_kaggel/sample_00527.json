  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis, nonperforated. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Appendectomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness. Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia. The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp. The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread. The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean. The cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound. After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties. The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix. The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp. The stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen. The peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline. The mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the peritoneum and 0 Vicryl for the internal oblique and external oblique layers. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing was placed on the wound. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Appendicitis.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Appendicitis, non‑perforated.  \n**Procedure performed:** Appendectomy.  \n**Anesthesia:** General endotracheal.\n\n**Procedure:**  \nAfter the patient gave informed consent, she was taken to the operating room and laid on her back on the table. General anesthesia was started without any problems. The surgeon cleaned and covered the area in the usual sterile way. A horizontal cut was made in the lower right abdomen at the spot that hurt the most. The surgeon used a cautery device to cut through the outer layer of the abdominal wall. The outer muscle was cut along its fibers and spread with a clamp. The next muscle layer was cut in the same way. The inner muscle, its fascia, and the lining of the abdomen were cut sharply, giving the surgeon access to the inside of the belly without any issues. Inside, the fluid was clear. The surgeon grabbed the cecum (the beginning of the large intestine) with a moist sponge and moved it into the incision. Once the appendix was fully seen, the surgeon cut the tissue that connects it to the rest of the bowel (mesentery) between two clamps and tied it with 2‑0 Vicryl sutures. The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp, then the clamp was moved up the appendix. The base was tied again with a 2‑0 Vicryl stitch over the crushed area, and the appendix was cut at the clamp. The remaining tip of the appendix was cauterized, and the cecum was put back into the abdomen. Warm sterile salt water was used to rinse the inside. The surgeon checked the area for bleeding and found none. The incision was closed in layers: the inner lining with 2‑0 Vicryl, the inner and outer muscle layers with 0 Vicryl, and the skin with 4‑0 Monocryl in a smooth, buried stitch. The skin was treated with benzoin and covered with Steri‑Strips. A dressing was put on the wound. All instruments and sponges were counted and confirmed correct. The patient tolerated the surgery well, was taken off the breathing tube, and went to recovery in good, stable condition."
