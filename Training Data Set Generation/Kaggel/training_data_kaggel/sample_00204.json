  "medical": "EXAM:MRI RIGHT ANKLE CLINICAL:This is a 51 year old female who first came into the office 3/4/05 with right ankle pain. She stepped on ice the evening prior and twisted her ankle. PF's showed no frank fracture, dislocation, or subluxations. FINDINGS: Received for interpretation is an MRI examination performed on 4/28/2005. There is a &quot;high ankle sprain&quot; of the distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex involving the anterior tibiofibular ligament with marked ligamentous inflammatory thickening and diffuse interstitial edema. There is osteoarthritic spur formation at the anterior aspect of the fibula with a small 2mm osseous structure within the markedly thickened anterior talofibular ligament suggesting a small ligamentous osseous avulsion. The distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex remains intact without a complete rupture. There is no widening of the ankle mortis. The posterior talofibular ligament remains intact. There is marked ligamentous thickening of the anterior talofibular ligament of the lateral collateral ligamentous complex suggesting the sequela of a remote lateral ankle sprain. There is thickening of the posterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. There is a flat retromalleolar sulcus. There is a full-thickness longitudinal split tear of the peroneus brevis tendon within the retromalleolar groove. The tear extends to the level of the inferior peroneal retinaculum. There is anterior displacement of the peroneus longus tendon into the split peroneus tendon tear. There is severe synovitis of the peroneus longus tendon sheath with prominent fluid distention. The synovitis extends to the level of the inferior peroneal retinaculum. There is a focal area of chondral thinning of the hyaline cartilage of the medial talar dome with a focal area of subchondral plate cancellous marrow resorption consistent with and area of prior talar dome contusion but there is no focal osteochondral impaction or osteochondral defect. There is minimal fluid within the tibiotalar articulation. There is minimal fluid within the posterior subtalar articulation with mild anterior capsular prolapse. Normal talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations. The anterior superior calcaneal process is normal. There is mild tenosynovitis of the posterior tibialis tendon sheath but an intrinsically normal tendon. There is an os navicularis (Type II synchondrosis) with an intact synchondrosis and no active marrow stress phenomenon. Normal flexor digitorum longus tendon. There is prominent fluid distention of the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath with capsular distention proximal to the posterior talar processes with prominent fluid distention of the synovial sheath. There is a loculated fluid collection within Kagers fat measuring approximately 1 x 1 x 2.5cm in size, extending to the posterior subtalar facet joint consistent with a ganglion of either posterior subtalar facet origin or arising from the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath. There is mild tenosynovitis of the Achilles tendon with mild fusiform enlargement of the non-insertional Watershed zone of the Achilles tendon but there is no demonstrated tendon tear or tenosynovitis. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 4cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon. There is no Haglunds deformity. There is a plantar calcaneal spur measuring approximately 6mm in size, without a reactive marrow stress phenomenon. Normal plantar fascia. IMPRESSION: Partial high ankle sprain with diffuse interstitial edema of the anterior tibiofibular ligament with a ligamentous chip avulsion but without a disruption of the anterior tibiofibular ligament. Marked ligamentous thickening of the lateral collateral ligamentous complex consistent with the sequela of a remote lateral ankle sprain. Full-thickness longitudinal split tear of the peroneus brevis tendon with severe synovitis of the peroneal tendon sheath. Post-traumatic deformity of the medial talar dome consistent with a prior osteochondral impaction injury but no osteochondral defect. Residual subchondral plate cancellous marrow edema. Severe synovitis of the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath with prominent fluid distention of the synovial sheath proximal to the posterior talar processes. Septated cystic structure within Kagers fat triangle extending along the superior aspect of the calcaneus consistent with a ganglion of either articular or synovial sheath origin. Plantar calcaneal spur but no reactive marrow stress phenomenon. Mild tendinosis of the Achilles tendon but no tendinitis or tendon tear. Os navicularis (Type II synchondrosis) without an active marrow stress phenomenon.",
  "layman": "**EXAM: MRI RIGHT ANKLE**\n\n**CLINICAL:**  \nA 51‑year‑old woman first came to the office on March 4, 2005 with pain in her right ankle. She stepped on ice the night before and twisted her ankle. X‑rays did not show a clear fracture, dislocation, or joint shift.\n\n**FINDINGS:**  \nThe MRI taken on April 28, 2005 shows a “high ankle sprain.” The ligament that connects the tibia and fibula near the ankle (the anterior tibiofibular ligament) is swollen and inflamed, but it has not torn completely. There is no widening of the ankle joint. A small bone spur is present on the front of the fibula, and a tiny bone fragment (about 2 mm) is seen in the thickened front talofibular ligament, suggesting a small bone pull‑out injury.\n\nThe front talofibular ligament and the back talofibular ligament are thickened, indicating a past lateral ankle sprain. The back talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments are also thickened. The space behind the ankle bone (retromalleolar sulcus) is flat.\n\nA full‑thickness tear runs lengthwise through the peroneus brevis tendon in the retromalleolar groove. The tear reaches the lower peroneal retinaculum, and the peroneus longus tendon has shifted into the tear. The peroneus longus tendon sheath is heavily inflamed and filled with fluid, extending to the lower peroneal retinaculum.\n\nThere is a small area where the cartilage on the inside of the talus (medial talar dome) is thinner, with underlying bone marrow changes that match a previous bruise. No bone chip or defect is seen. A tiny amount of fluid is present in the ankle joint and the back subtalar joint, with a slight bulge of the front joint capsule. The talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints are normal. The front part of the heel bone (anterior superior calcaneal process) is normal.\n\nThe posterior tibialis tendon sheath shows mild inflammation, but the tendon itself is normal. An “os navicularis” (a small bone in the navicular) is present and intact, with no bone stress. The flexor digitorum longus tendon is normal. The flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath is swollen with fluid, and the fluid extends above the back of the talus. A fluid pocket (about 1 × 1 × 2.5 cm) is found in the fat pad behind the heel (Kager’s fat), likely a ganglion cyst from the joint or tendon sheath.\n\nThe Achilles tendon shows mild inflammation and a slight swelling in the middle part, but no tear. The soleus muscle is low‑lying, reaching close to the Achilles insertion. There is no Haglund’s deformity. A small heel spur (about 6 mm) is present, but no bone stress. The plantar fascia is normal.\n\n**IMPRESSION:**  \n- Partial high ankle sprain with swelling of the front tibiofibular ligament and a small bone pull‑out, but the ligament is intact.  \n- Thickened lateral ankle ligaments from a past sprain.  \n- Full‑thickness tear of the peroneus brevis tendon with severe inflammation of its sheath.  \n- Post‑traumatic changes in the inside of the talus from a previous bruise, with bone marrow swelling but no bone defect.  \n- Severe inflammation of the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath with fluid above the back of the talus.  \n- A cystic fluid collection in the fat pad behind the heel, likely a ganglion.  \n- Heel spur present but no bone stress.  \n- Mild Achilles tendon inflammation without tear.  \n- Os navicularis present and normal."
