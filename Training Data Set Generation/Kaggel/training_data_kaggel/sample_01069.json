  "medical": "CC: Progressive visual loss. HX: 76 y/o male suddenly became anosmic following shoulder surgery 13 years prior to this presentation. He continues to be anosmic, but has also recently noted decreased vision OD. He denies any headaches, weakness, numbness, weight loss, or nasal discharge. MEDS: none. PMH: 1) Diabetes Mellitus dx 1 year ago. 2) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy, s/p TURP. 3) Right shoulder surgery (?DJD). FHX: noncontributory. SHX: Denies history of Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP132/66 HR78 RR16 36.0C MS: A&O to person, place, and time. No other specifics given in Neurosurgery/Otolaryngology/Neuro-ophthalmology notes. CN: Visual acuity has declined from 20/40 to 20/400, OD; 20/30, OS. No RAPD. EOM was full and smooth and without nystagmus. Goldmann visual fields revealed a central scotoma and enlarged blind spot OD and OS (OD worse) with a normal periphery. Intraocular pressures were 15/14 (OD/OS). There was moderate pallor of the disc, OD. Facial sensation was decreased on the right side (V1 distribution). Motor/Sensory/Coord/Station/Gait: were all unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout. Plantars were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: MRI Brain, 10/7/92, revealed: a large 6x5x6cm slightly heterogeneous, mostly isointense lesion on both T1 and T2 weighted images arising from the planum sphenoidale and olfactory groove. The mass extends approximately 3.6cm superior to the planum into both frontal regions with edema in both frontal lobes. The mass extends 2.5cm inferiorly involving the ethmoid sinuses with resultant obstruction of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses. It also extends into the superomedial aspect of the right maxillary sinus. There is probable partial encasement of both internal carotid arteries just above the siphon. The optic nerves are difficult to visualize but there is also probable encasement of these structures as well. The mass enhances significantly with gadolinium contrast. These finds are consistent with Meningioma. The patient underwent excision of this tumor by simultaneous bifrontal craniotomy and lateral rhinotomy following an intrasinus biopsy which confirmed the meningioma. Postoperatively, he lost visual acuity, OS, but this gradually returned to baseline. His 9/6/96 neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed visual acuity of 20/25-3 (OD) and 20/80-2 (OS). His visual fields continued to abnormal, but improved and stable when compared to 10/92. His anosmia never resolved.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: gradual loss of vision.  \n\nHistory: A 76‑year‑old man suddenly lost his sense of smell after shoulder surgery 13 years ago. He still cannot smell and has recently noticed that his right eye vision is getting worse. He has no headaches, weakness, numbness, weight loss, or runny nose. He is not taking any medications.  \n\nPast medical history: diagnosed with diabetes one year ago; had enlarged prostate treated with TURP; had right shoulder surgery for arthritis. Family history: nothing notable. Social history: does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.  \n\nPhysical exam: Blood pressure 132/66, heart rate 78, breathing 16, temperature 36.0 °C. He is alert and oriented. No other special findings from neurosurgery, ENT, or eye specialist notes. Eye exam: vision in the right eye dropped from 20/40 to 20/400; left eye is 20/30. No relative afferent pupillary defect. Eye movements are normal and smooth, no jerky movements. Visual field test shows a central blind spot and enlarged blind spot in both eyes, worse in the right eye, but the outer field is normal. Eye pressure is 15 in the right eye, 14 in the left. The optic disc in the right eye looks pale. Facial sensation is reduced on the right side (upper face). Muscle strength, sensation, coordination, balance, and walking are all normal. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical; toes flex normally. Genital exam is normal.  \n\nCourse: A brain scan on 10/7/92 showed a large (6 × 5 × 6 cm) mass near the front of the skull and the area where the sense of smell comes from. The mass extends upward into both frontal lobes, causing swelling, and downward into the ethmoid sinuses, blocking the sphenoid and frontal sinuses, and into the upper part of the right maxillary sinus. It probably partly surrounds both internal carotid arteries and the optic nerves. The mass lights up with contrast dye, consistent with a meningioma. The patient had surgery to remove the tumor using a front‑brain approach and a nose approach after a biopsy confirmed it was a meningioma. After surgery he lost vision in the left eye, but it gradually returned to normal. A neuro‑eye exam on 9/6/96 showed vision of 20/25 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. Visual fields were still abnormal but had improved and stayed stable compared to the 10/92 exam. His loss of smell never improved."
