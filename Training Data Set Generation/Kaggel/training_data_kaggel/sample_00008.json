  "medical": "CC: Transient visual field loss. HX: This 58 y/o RHF had a 2 yr h/o increasing gait difficulty which she attributed to generalized weakness and occasional visual obscurations. She was evaluated by a local physician several days prior to this presentation (1/7/91), for clumsiness of her right hand and falling. HCT and MRI brain revealed bilateral posterior clinoid masses. MEDS: Colace, Quinidine, Synthroid, Lasix, Lanoxin, KCL, Elavil, Tenormin. PMH: 1) Obesity. 2) VBG, 1990. 3) A-Fib. 4) HTN. 5) Hypothyroidism. 6) Hypercholesterolemia. 7) Briquet's syndrome: h/o of hysterical paralysis. 8) CLL, dx 1989; in 1992 presented with left neck lymphadenopathy and received 5 cycles of chlorambucil/prednisone chemotherapy; 10/95 parotid gland biopsy was consistent with CLL and she received 5 more cycles of chlorambucil/prednisone; 1/10/96, she received 3000cGy to right parotid mass. 9) SNHL FHX: Father died, MI age 61. SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: Vitals were unremarkable. The neurologic exam was unremarkable except for obesity and mild decreased PP about the right upper and lower face, diffusely about the left upper and lower face, per neurosurgery notes. The neuro-ophthalmologic exam was unremarkable, per Neuro-ophthalmology. COURSE: She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 1/8/91. This revealed a 15x17x20mm LICA paraclinoid/ophthalmic artery aneurysm and a 5x7mm RICA paraclinoid/ophthalmic artery aneurysm. On 1/16/91 she underwent a left frontotemporal craniotomy and exploration of the left aneurysm. The aneurysm neck went into the cavernous sinus and was unclippable so it was wrapped. She has complained of headaches since.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Brief loss of vision.  \n**History:** A 58‑year‑old woman with right‑hand weakness (RHF) has had worsening walking difficulty for the past two years, which she thinks is due to overall weakness and occasional blurry vision. She saw a local doctor a few days before this visit (January 7, 1991) because her right hand was clumsy and she was falling. Blood tests and a brain MRI showed two masses behind the back of the skull.  \n\n**Medications:** Colace, Quinidine, Synthroid, Lasix, Lanoxin, potassium chloride, Elavil, Tenormin.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Obesity.  \n2. Ventricular bigeminy (VBG) in 1990.  \n3. Atrial fibrillation.  \n4. High blood pressure.  \n5. Low thyroid hormone.  \n6. High cholesterol.  \n7. Briquet’s syndrome (history of hysterical paralysis).  \n8. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosed in 1989. In 1992 she had swollen lymph nodes in the left neck and received five cycles of chlorambucil/prednisone chemotherapy. A parotid gland biopsy in October 1995 confirmed CLL, and she had five more chemotherapy cycles. On January 10, 1996 she received 3000 cGy of radiation to a right parotid mass.  \n9. Sensorineural hearing loss.  \n\n**Family history:** Father died of a heart attack at age 61.  \n\n**Social history:** No tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.  \n\n**Exam:** Vital signs were normal. Neurologic exam was normal except for obesity and mild weakness of the right face and more diffuse weakness of the left face, as noted by neurosurgery. Neuro‑ophthalmology exam was normal.  \n\n**Course:** On January 8, 1991 she had a cerebral angiogram that found a 15 × 17 × 20 mm aneurysm in the left internal carotid artery (LICA) near the paraclinoid/ophthalmic artery and a 5 × 7 mm aneurysm in the right internal carotid artery (RICA) in the same area. On January 16, 1991 she had a left frontotemporal craniotomy to explore the left aneurysm. The aneurysm’s neck extended into the cavernous sinus and could not be clipped, so it was wrapped. She has had headaches since the surgery."
