  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteral calculus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteropelvic junction calculus. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Right retrograde pyelogram. 3. Right double-J stent placement 22 x 4.5 mm. FIRST SECOND ANESTHESIA: General. SPECIMEN: Urine for culture and sensitivity. DRAINS: 22 x 4.5 mm right double-J ureteral stent. PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to operating room and placed in the supine position. She was given general anesthesia and then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through the urethra into the bladder. There was noted to be some tightness of the urethra on passage. On visualization of the bladder, there were no stones or any other debris within the bladder. There were no abnormalities seen. No masses, diverticuli, or other abnormal findings. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and attempts to pass to a cone tip catheter, however, the ureteral orifice was noted to be also tight and we were unable to pass the cone tip catheter. The cone tip catheter was removed and a glidewire was then passed without difficulty up into the renal pelvis. An open-end ureteral catheter was then passed ________ into the distal right ureter. Retrograde pyelogram was then performed. There was noted to be an UPJ calculus with no noted hydronephrosis. The wire was then passed back through the ureteral catheter. The catheter was removed and a 22 x 4.5 mm double-J ureteral stent was then passed over the glidewire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance. The stent was clear within the kidney as well as within the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She will be discharged home. She is to follow up with Dr. X for ESWL procedure. She will be given prescription for Darvocet and will be asked to have a KUB x-ray done prior to her followup and to bring them with her to her appointment.",
  "layman": "**Before the surgery:** The patient had a stone in the right ureter.  \n**After the surgery:** The stone was found at the junction where the right ureter meets the kidney.\n\n**What was done:**\n\n1. A cystoscopy (looking inside the bladder with a small camera).  \n2. A retrograde pyelogram (X‑ray of the kidney and ureter by injecting dye from the bladder).  \n3. Placement of a right double‑J stent (a small tube that keeps the ureter open) measuring 22 mm long and 4.5 mm wide.\n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia (the patient was fully asleep).\n\n**Samples taken:** Urine was collected to test for infection.\n\n**Drains:** The 22 mm × 4.5 mm double‑J stent was left in place.\n\n**Procedure details:**\n\n- After the patient gave consent, she was taken to the operating room and laid on her back.  \n- She was put under general anesthesia and then positioned on her back with her legs spread (dorsal lithotomy).  \n- A #21 French cystoscope was inserted through the urethra into the bladder. The urethra was a bit tight, but the bladder was clear—no stones or other debris, and no abnormal growths or holes.  \n- The surgeon tried to pass a cone‑tip catheter into the right ureter, but the opening was also tight. The catheter was removed, and a glidewire was successfully passed into the kidney.  \n- An open‑end ureteral catheter was then placed into the lower part of the right ureter.  \n- A retrograde pyelogram showed a stone at the ureter‑to‑kidney junction (UPJ) with no swelling of the kidney.  \n- The wire was pulled back through the catheter, the catheter was removed, and the 22 mm × 4.5 mm double‑J stent was threaded over the wire under X‑ray and cystoscopy guidance. The stent was seen in both the kidney and the bladder.  \n- The bladder was drained, the cystoscope was removed, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n**Aftercare:**  \nThe patient will go home. She will see Dr. X for a future shock‑wave stone‑breaking (ESWL) session.  \nShe will receive a prescription for Darvocet (pain medication).  \nShe should have a KUB X‑ray (kidney, ureter, bladder) before her next appointment and bring the results with her."
