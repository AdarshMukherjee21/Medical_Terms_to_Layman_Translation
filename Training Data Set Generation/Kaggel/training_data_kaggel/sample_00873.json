  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hematochezia. 2. Refractory dyspepsia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm. 2. Diverticulosis coli. 2. Acute and chronic gastritis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Colonoscopy to cecum with snare polypectomy. 2. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURES: This is a 43-year-old white male who presents as an outpatient to the General Surgery Service with hematochezia with no explainable source at the anal verge. He also had refractory dyspepsia despite b.i.d., Nexium therapy. The patient does use alcohol and tobacco. The patient gave informed consent for the procedure. GROSS FINDINGS: At the time of colonoscopy, the entire length of colon was visualized. The patient was found to have a sigmoid diverticulosis. He also was found to have some colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm. The polyps were large enough to be treated with snare cautery technique. The polyps were achieved and submitted to pathology. EGD did confirm acute and chronic gastritis. The biopsies were performed for H&E and CLO testing. The patient had no evidence of distal esophagitis or ulcers. No mass lesions were seen. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite with the heart and lungs examination unremarkable. The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure. The patient was placed in the left lateral position where intravenous Demerol and Versed were given in a titrated fashion. The video Olympus colonoscope was advanced per anus and without difficulty to the level of cecum. Photographic documentation of the diverticulosis and polyps were obtained. The patient's polyps were removed in a similar fashion, each removed with snare cautery. The polyps were encircled at their stalk. Increasing the tension and cautery was applied as coagulation and cutting blunt mode, 15/15 was utilized. Good blanching was seen. The polyp was retrieved with the suction port of the scope. The patient was re-scoped to the polyp levels to confirm that there was no evidence of perforation or bleeding at the polypectomy site. Diverticulosis coli was also noted. With colonoscopy completed, the patient was then turned for EGD. The oropharynx was previously anesthetized with Cetacaine spray and a biteblock was placed. Video Olympus GIF gastroscope model was inserted per os and advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx. The esophagus revealed a GE junction at 39 cm. The GE junction was grossly within normal limits. The stomach was entered and distended with air. Acute and chronic gastritis features as stated were appreciated. The pylorus was traversed with normal duodenum. The stomach was again reentered. Retroflex maneuver of the scope confirmed that there was no evidence of hiatal hernia. There were no ulcers or mass lesions seen. The patient had biopsy performed of the antrum for H&E and CLO testing. There was no evidence of untoward bleeding at biopsy sites. Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope. The patient will be placed on a reflux diet, given instruction and information on Nexium usage. Additional recommendations will follow pending biopsy results. He is to also abstain from alcohol and tobacco. He will require follow-up colonoscopy again in three years for polyp disease.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES  \n1. Blood in the stool (hematochezia).  \n2. Persistent indigestion that has not improved with twice‑daily Nexium.  \n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES  \n1. Colon polyps found at 35 cm and 15 cm from the anus.  \n2. Diverticulosis of the colon (small pouches).  \n3. Acute and chronic gastritis (stomach inflammation).  \n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED  \n1. Colonoscopy to the cecum with snare removal of the polyps.  \n2. Upper‑GI endoscopy (EGD) with biopsies.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURES  \nA 43‑year‑old white man came to the General Surgery outpatient clinic with bright red blood in his stool that could not be traced to the anal opening. He also had indigestion that did not improve with twice‑daily Nexium. He drinks alcohol and smokes. He gave informed consent for the procedures.  \n\nGROSS FINDINGS  \nDuring colonoscopy the entire colon was seen. The patient had diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm. The polyps were large enough to be removed with a snare and cautery. The removed polyps were sent to pathology. The EGD confirmed acute and chronic gastritis. Biopsies were taken for routine staining (H&E) and for a test for Helicobacter pylori (CLO). No esophageal inflammation, ulcers, or masses were seen.  \n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS  \nThe patient was taken to the endoscopy room. His heart and lungs were fine and his vital signs stayed stable. He was positioned on his left side and given IV Demerol and Versed as needed. A video colonoscope was passed through the anus and easily reached the cecum. Images of the diverticulosis and polyps were taken. Each polyp was snared, cauterized, and removed. The snare was tightened around the stalk, cautery was applied, and the polyp was pulled out with the suction port. The area was re‑examined to make sure there was no perforation or bleeding. Diverticulosis was also noted.  \n\nAfter the colonoscopy, the patient was turned for the upper‑GI endoscopy. The throat was numbed with Cetacaine spray and a bite block was used. A video gastroscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced without difficulty. The gastroesophageal junction was at 39 cm and looked normal. The stomach was inflated with air. Features of acute and chronic gastritis were seen. The pylorus and duodenum were normal. A retroflex view showed no hiatal hernia. No ulcers or masses were found. A biopsy of the antrum was taken for H&E and CLO testing. No bleeding occurred at the biopsy sites. Air was released as the scope was withdrawn.  \n\nFOLLOW‑UP  \nThe patient will be advised to follow a reflux diet and to use Nexium as directed. Additional instructions will be given after the biopsy results are available. He should stop drinking alcohol and smoking. A colonoscopy will be scheduled again in three years to monitor for polyps."
