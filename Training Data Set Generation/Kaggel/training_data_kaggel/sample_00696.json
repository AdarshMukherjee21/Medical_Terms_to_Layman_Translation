POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Partial rotator cuff tear with impingement syndrome. 2. Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopy with arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement. 2. Anterior acromioplasty. 3. Mumford procedure left shoulder. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital. This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention. He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting. After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date. Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side. All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum. The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact. Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis. Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine upon the operative table. After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in. A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out. Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff. Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness. Attention was then turned to the subacromial region. The scope was directed subacromially. A portal was created laterally. Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle. Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver. #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this. It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200. Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure. Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured. An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation. Flaps were created. Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly. Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp. An excellent decompression was present. CA ligament had been previously resected. We then took the incision over the distal clavicle. The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw. The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges. Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl. Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same. A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing. 0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure. Pain buster catheter was hooked up. The patient's arm was placed in arm sling. He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.",

Wear‑and‑tear arthritis of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint in the left shoulder; a possible SLAP lesion was considered.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. Partial rotator cuff tear with impingement.  \n2. Degenerative arthritis of the left AC joint.\n\n**Procedure performed**  \n1. Arthroscopic cleaning of the torn rotator cuff.  \n2. Removal of bone from the front of the acromion (anterior acromioplasty).  \n3. Mumford procedure (removal of the end of the clavicle) on the left shoulder.\n\n**Specifications**  \nThe surgery was done in the inpatient operating room #1 at ABCD General Hospital. The patient was positioned in a modified beach‑chair position and received an interscalene block followed by general anesthesia.\n\n**History and findings**  \nA 38‑year‑old white male who is morbidly obese has had increasing pain in his left shoulder for several months. Outpatient treatments, including a joint injection, only gave temporary relief. After discussing options, risks, and expected outcomes, he chose surgery. During the arthroscopy, a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon was seen. The shoulder joint, biceps tendon, and labrum were intact. The rest of the rotator cuff was healthy. In the space under the acromion, there was inflammation, and the distal clavicle showed wear.\n\n**Operative procedure**  \nThe patient lay on his back. After the nerve block, he was placed in the beach‑chair position. The surgical area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Two portals were made—one behind and one in front of the shoulder—to allow the arthroscope to view the joint. A diagnostic arthroscopy was performed. The torn part of the rotator cuff (about 25 % of its thickness) was cleaned with a meniscal shaver. The scope was then moved to the subacromial space. A lateral portal was created. Because the patient’s blood pressure rose to 165‑200 mm Hg and the anesthetic was difficult to control, the surgeon switched to an open procedure. The patient was safely anesthetized again.\n\nAn oblique skin incision was made across the shoulder. Blood was stopped with electrocautery. The front part of the deltoid muscle was moved down. The front acromion was reshaped with a saw, a Micro‑Aire, and a beaver‑tail rasp, creating good space for the tendons. The CA ligament had already been removed. The surgeon then removed the last 12‑14 mm of the distal clavicle with a Micro‑Aire saw and smoothed the edges with the rasp. A pain‑control catheter was placed under the AC capsule and the deltoid, secured with #1 Vicryl sutures. The deltoid was lifted and closed with transosseous sutures. The skin and subcutaneous tissue were closed with running and interrupted Vicryl stitches, and a subcuticular stitch was used for the skin. A compression dressing with Adaptic, 4 × 4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape was applied. Before closing the skin, 0.25 % Marcaine was injected into the joint. The pain catheter was connected. The arm was placed in a sling. The patient was moved to the recovery area in good condition.\n\n**Prognosis**  \nThe expected outcome for this patient is fair."
