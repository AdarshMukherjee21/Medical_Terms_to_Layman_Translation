  "medical": "PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed in the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic. Ancef 1 g was given for infectious prophylaxis. Once the patient was under general anesthesia, the knee was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Once the knee was fully prepped and draped, then we made 2 standard portals medial and lateral. Through the lateral portal, the camera was placed. Through the medial portal, tools were placed. We proceeded to examine scarring of the patellofemoral joint. Then we probed the patellofemoral joint. A chondroplasty was performed using a shaver. Then we moved down to the lateral gutter. Some loose bodies were found using a shaver and dissection. We moved down the medial gutter. No plica was found. We moved into the medial joint; we found that the medial meniscus was intact. We moved to the lateral joint and found that the lateral meniscus was intact. Pictures were taken. We drained the knee and washed out the knee with copious amounts of sterile saline solution. The instruments were removed. The 2 portals were closed using 3-0 nylon suture. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, Kerlix x2, and TED stocking were placed. The patient was successfully extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then spoke with the family going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After the patient gave written permission, she was taken back to the operating room and identified. She was laid on the table on her back and given general anesthesia. A 1‑gram dose of Ancef was given to prevent infection. Once she was asleep, the knee was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Two standard small incisions were made on the inside and outside of the knee. The camera was inserted through the outside incision, and surgical tools were inserted through the inside incision. We looked at the scar tissue around the kneecap joint. We used a probe to feel the joint and then used a shaver to smooth the cartilage (chondroplasty). We then examined the outer side of the joint (lateral gutter) and found some loose pieces of tissue, which we removed with the shaver and by gentle cutting. We checked the inner side (medial gutter) and found no abnormal tissue. In the inner joint, the medial meniscus was healthy. In the outer joint, the lateral meniscus was also healthy. We took pictures. We drained fluid from the knee and washed it out with a lot of sterile salt water. All instruments were removed. The two incisions were closed with 3‑0 nylon stitches. We applied Xeroform dressings (4 × 4), two layers of Kerlix gauze, and a compression stocking. The patient was taken off the breathing tube and moved to the recovery room in stable condition. I then talked with her family about what happened, the instructions for after the surgery, and the follow‑up care."
