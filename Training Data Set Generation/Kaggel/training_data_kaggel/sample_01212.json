  "medical": "REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Left flank pain, ureteral stone. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 76-year-old female who was referred to us from Dr. X for left flank pain. The patient was found to have a left ureteral stone measuring about 1.3 cm in size per the patient's history. The patient has had pain in the abdomen and across the back for the last four to five days. The patient has some nausea and vomiting. The patient wants something done for the stone. The patient denies any hematuria, dysuria, burning or pain. The patient denies any fevers. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Years ago she had surgery that she does not recall. MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: None. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies any seizure disorder, chest pain, denies any shortness of breath, denies any dysuria, burning or pain, denies any nausea or vomiting at this time. The patient does have a history of nausea and vomiting, but is doing better. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile. Vitals are stable. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft, left-sided flank pain and left lower abdominal pain. The rest of the exam is benign. LABORATORY DATA: White count of 7.8, hemoglobin 13.8, and platelets 234,000. The patient's creatinine is 0.92. ASSESSMENT: 1. Left flank pain. 2. Left ureteral stone. 3. Nausea and vomiting. PLAN: Plan for laser lithotripsy tomorrow. Options such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, and shockwave lithotripsy were discussed. The patient has a pretty enlarged stone. Failure of the procedure if the stone is significantly impacted into the ureteral wall was discussed. The patient understood that the success of the surgery may be or may not be 100%, that she may require shockwave lithotripsy if we are unable to get the entire stone out in one sitting. The patient understood all the risk, benefits of the procedure and wanted to proceed. Need for stent was also discussed with the patient. The patient will be scheduled for surgery tomorrow. Plan for continuation of the antibiotics, obtain urinalysis and culture, and plan for KUB to evaluate for the exact location of the stone prior to surgery tomorrow.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:**  \nThe patient has pain on the left side of her back and abdomen because of a kidney stone in the left ureter.\n\n**Brief history:**  \nA 76‑year‑old woman was sent to us by Dr. X because of left flank pain. She has a 1.3‑centimeter stone in the left ureter. She has felt abdominal and back pain for the last 4–5 days and has had some nausea and vomiting. She wants treatment for the stone. She does not have blood in her urine, painful urination, fever, or other symptoms.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \nNo significant medical problems.  \n\n**Past surgical history:**  \nShe had surgery many years ago, but she does not remember the details.  \n\n**Medications:**  \nNone.  \n\n**Allergies:**  \nNone.  \n\n**Review of systems:**  \nShe reports no seizures, chest pain, shortness of breath, painful urination, or current nausea/vomiting. She has had nausea and vomiting before but is feeling better now.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- **Vitals:** No fever; stable.  \n- **Heart:** Regular rhythm.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft; pain on the left side of the back and lower left abdomen.  \n- **Other:** No other abnormal findings.  \n\n**Labs:**  \nWhite blood cell count 7.8, hemoglobin 13.8, platelets 234,000, creatinine 0.92.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n1. Left flank pain.  \n2. Left ureteral stone.  \n3. Nausea and vomiting.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nWe will perform laser lithotripsy tomorrow to break up the stone. We discussed other options such as waiting, laser lithotripsy, and shockwave lithotripsy. The stone is large, and if it is stuck to the ureter wall the procedure might not fully remove it. The patient understands that the surgery may not be 100% successful and that she might need shockwave lithotripsy if the stone isn’t completely cleared in one session. She also understands the risks and benefits and has decided to proceed. We talked about the possibility of needing a stent. She will be scheduled for surgery tomorrow. We will continue antibiotics, get a urine test and culture, and do a KUB X‑ray to confirm the stone’s exact location before the surgery."
