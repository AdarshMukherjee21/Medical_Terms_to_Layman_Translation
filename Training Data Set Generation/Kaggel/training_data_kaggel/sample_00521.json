  "medical": "3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION This patient is undergoing 3-dimensionally planned radiation therapy in order to adequately target structures at risk while diminishing the degree of exposure to uninvolved adjacent normal structures. This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects. With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended. The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized. Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived. Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician. Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the immobilization device. The patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table. Scans are performed through the targeted area. The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images. The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures. This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features. Appropriate blocks are designed. Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume. Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures. Once appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician. The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician. Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised. If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated. In view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470.",
  "layman": "**3‑Dimensional Simulation**\n\nThe patient is getting a 3‑D planned radiation treatment. This helps the doctors aim the radiation at the tumor and nearby risky tissues while sparing the normal tissues that don’t need treatment. It improves the chance of stopping the tumor and reduces both short‑term and long‑term side effects.\n\nBecause the plan is 3‑D, it takes more time and effort from the doctor, therapist, and dosimetrist. The process starts in a regular simulation room. The patient is marked with special spots, positioned, and held still. The team decides on the size and arrangement of the radiation fields, the angles of the machine’s arm (gantry), the collimator angles, and how many fields to use. X‑ray pictures are taken and the doctor signs off on them. Marks are then placed on the patient’s skin or on the device that keeps them still.\n\nNext, the patient goes to the imaging department and lies on a flat CT scanner table. CT scans are taken through the area that needs treatment. The radiation oncologist reviews the scans and outlines the tumor, the area that must receive radiation (target volume), and any critical normal structures on the CT images. The dosimetrist then looks at the slices on a treatment‑planning computer, using the marked structures. The volume is rebuilt in a virtual 3‑D space using a beam‑eye view. Blocks (shapes that shape the beam) are designed. Computer calculations are done in multiple planes to make sure the dose covers the target while keeping the dose to normal tissues low. If needed, the field arrangements and blocks are changed.\n\nOnce the computer shows the right beam settings and dose distribution, the doctor reviews the individual slices. The beam‑eye view, block design, and volumes are printed and checked by the doctor. After approval, physical blocks or a multi‑leaf collimator (a machine that shapes the beam) are made. If the field arrangement changes a lot from the original simulation, the patient returns to the simulator for a new computer‑guided simulation. Because this process takes a lot of time and effort, it is billed under the special procedure code 77470."
