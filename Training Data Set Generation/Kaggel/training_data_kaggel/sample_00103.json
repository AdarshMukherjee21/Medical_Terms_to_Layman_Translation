  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT SHOULDER CLINICAL:This is a 26 year old with a history of instability. Examination was preformed on 12/20/2005. FINDINGS: There is supraspinatus tendinosis without a full-thickness tear, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy (series #105 images #4-6). Normal infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. Normal long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove. There is medial subluxation of the tendon under the transverse humeral ligament, and there is tendinosis of the intracapsular portion of the tendon with partial tearing, but there is no complete tear or discontinuity. Biceps anchor is intact (series #105 images #4-7; series #102 images #10-22). There is a very large Hill-Sachs fracture, involving almost the entire posterior half of the humeral head (series #102 images #13-19). This is associated with a large inferior bony Bankart lesion that measures approximately 15 x 18mm in AP and craniocaudal dimension with impaction and fragmentation (series #104 images #10-14; series #102 images #18-28). There is medial and inferior displacement of the fragment. There are multiple interarticular bodies, some of which may be osteochondromatous and some may be osseous measuring up to 8mm in diameter. (These are too numerous to count.) There is marked stretching, attenuation and areas of thickening of the inferior and middle glenohumeral ligaments, compatible with a chronic tear with scarring but there is no discontinuity or demonstrated HAGL lesion (series #105 images #5-10). Normal superior glenohumeral ligament. There is no SLAP tear. Normal acromioclavicular joint without narrowing of the subacromial space. Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments. There is fluid in the glenohumeral joint and biceps tendon sheath. IMPRESSION: There is a very large Hill-Sachs fracture involving most of the posterior half of the humeral head with an associated large and inferior and medial displaced osseous Bankart lesion. There are multiple intraarticular bodies, and there is a partial tear of the inferior and middle glenohumeral ligaments. There is medial subluxation of the long biceps tendon under the transverse humeral ligament with partial tearing of the intracapsular portion.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** MRI of the left shoulder  \n**Clinical:** 26‑year‑old with a history of shoulder instability. Exam was done on 12/20/2005.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The supraspinatus tendon shows wear (tendinosis) but is not torn all the way through, and it has no gap or pullback of its fibers. The muscle is still normal in size.  \n- The infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons are normal.  \n- The long head of the biceps tendon is normal inside the groove where it sits.  \n- The biceps tendon is slightly shifted toward the middle of the joint under the transverse humeral ligament. The part of the tendon inside the joint capsule has some wear and a partial tear, but it is not completely torn.  \n- The biceps anchor (where it attaches to bone) is intact.  \n- There is a very large Hill‑Sachs fracture that covers almost the entire back half of the humeral head (the bone of the upper arm).  \n- An associated large bone Bankart lesion is present below the joint, measuring about 15 mm front‑to‑back and 18 mm top‑to‑bottom. The fragment is pushed inward and downward.  \n- Many small bone fragments (some up to 8 mm) are scattered inside the joint.  \n- The lower and middle glenohumeral ligaments are stretched, thinned, and thickened in places, showing a chronic tear with scar tissue, but the ligaments are still connected and there is no HAGL lesion.  \n- The upper glenohumeral ligament is normal.  \n- No SLAP tear.  \n- The acromioclavicular joint is normal and the space under the acromion is not narrowed.  \n- The coracoacromial, coracohumeral, and coracoclavicular ligaments are normal.  \n- There is fluid in the shoulder joint and in the biceps tendon sheath.  \n\n**Impression:**  \nA very large Hill‑Sachs fracture covering most of the back half of the humeral head, with a large, displaced bone Bankart lesion below the joint. Multiple small bone fragments are inside the joint, and the lower and middle glenohumeral ligaments have a partial tear. The long biceps tendon is slightly shifted toward the middle of the joint under the transverse humeral ligament and has a partial tear inside the joint capsule."
