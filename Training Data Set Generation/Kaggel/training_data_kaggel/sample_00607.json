  "medical": "CC: Left hemiplegia. HX: A 58 y/o RHF awoke at 1:00AM on 10/23/92 with left hemiplegia and dysarthria which cleared within 15 minutes. She was seen at a local ER and neurological exam and CT Brain were reportedly unremarkable. She was admitted locally. She then had two more similar spells at 3AM and 11AM with resolution of the symptoms within an hour. She was placed on IV Heparin following the 3rd episode and was transferred to UIHC. She had not been taking ASA. PMH: 1)HTN. 2) Psoriasis. SHX: denied ETOH/Tobacco/illicit drug use. FHX: Unknown. MEDS: Heparin only. EXAM: BP160/90 HR145 (supine). BP105/35 HR128 (light headed, standing) RR12 T37.7C MS: Dysarthria only. Lucid thought process. CN: left lower facial weakness only. Motor: mild left hemiparesis with normal muscle bulk. Mildly increased left sided muscle tone. Sensory: unremarkable. Coordination: impaired secondary to weakness on left. Otherwise unremarkable. Station: left pronator drift. Romberg testing not done. Gait: not tested. Reflexes: symmetric; 2+ throughout. Gen Exam: CV: Tachycardic without murmur. COURSE: The patients signs and symptoms worsening during and after standing to check orthostatic blood pressures. She was immediately placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position and given IV fluids. Repeat neurologic exam at 5PM on the day of presentation revealed a return to the initial presentation of signs and symptoms. PT/PTT/GS/CBC/ABG were unremarkable. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with rate dependent junctional changes. CXR unremarkable. MRI Brain was obtained and showed an evolving right thalamic/lentiform nucleus infarction best illustrated by increased signal on the Proton density weighted images. Over the ensuing days of admission she had significant fluctuations of her BP (200mmHG to 140mmHG systolic). Her symptoms worsened with falls in BP. Her BP was initially controlled with esmolol or labetalol. Renal Ultrasound, abdominal/pelvic CT, renal function scan, serum and urine osmolality, urine catecholamines/metanephrine studies were unremarkable. Carotid doppler study revealed 0-15%BICA stenosis and antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. Cerebral angiogram was performed to r/o vasculitis. This revealed narrowing of the M1 segment of the right MCA. This was thought secondary to atherosclerosis and not vasculitis. She was discharged on ASA, Procardia XL, and Labetalol.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** weakness on the left side of the body.  \n\n**History:** A 58‑year‑old woman with right‑hand failure woke at 1:00 a.m. on 10/23/92 with weakness on the left side of her body and difficulty speaking. The symptoms went away in about 15 minutes. She was taken to a local emergency department where a neurological exam and a brain CT scan were normal. She was admitted to that hospital. She had two more similar episodes at 3 a.m. and 11 a.m.; each time the symptoms disappeared within an hour. After the third episode she was started on IV heparin and then transferred to UIHC. She had not been taking aspirin.  \n\n**Past medical history:** high blood pressure, psoriasis.  \n**Social history:** no alcohol, tobacco, or drug use.  \n**Family history:** unknown.  \n\n**Medications:** heparin only.  \n\n**Exam on arrival:**  \n- Blood pressure 160/90, heart rate 145 while lying down.  \n- Blood pressure 105/35, heart rate 128 while standing (she felt light‑headed).  \n- Respiratory rate 12, temperature 37.7 °C.  \n- Speech: only difficulty speaking.  \n- Thinking: clear.  \n- Facial nerves: weakness on the lower left side.  \n- Muscles: mild weakness on the left side, normal muscle size, slightly higher tone on the left.  \n- Sensation: normal.  \n- Coordination: poor on the left because of weakness.  \n- Other findings: left arm drift when she tried to hold it straight.  \n- Reflexes: normal and equal on both sides.  \n\n**General exam:** heart rate fast but no abnormal heart sounds.  \n\n**Course:** Her symptoms got worse when she stood up to check her blood pressure. She was put in a slightly tilted position and given IV fluids. A repeat exam at 5 p.m. that day showed the same weakness and speech difficulty as at first. Blood tests (PT, PTT, glucose, CBC, ABG) were normal. An ECG showed a fast heart rate with some junctional changes. A chest X‑ray was normal. An MRI of the brain showed a new stroke in the right thalamus and lentiform nucleus, best seen on proton density images.  \n\nDuring the next few days her blood pressure fluctuated a lot (from 200 mm Hg down to 140 mm Hg systolic). Her symptoms got worse when her blood pressure fell. Her blood pressure was initially treated with esmolol or labetalol. A kidney ultrasound, abdominal/pelvic CT, kidney function scan, blood and urine osmolality, and urine catecholamine tests were all normal. A carotid Doppler showed 0–15 % narrowing of the internal carotid arteries and normal flow in the vertebral arteries on both sides. A transthoracic echo was normal. A cerebral angiogram was done to rule out vasculitis and showed narrowing of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery, which was thought to be due to atherosclerosis, not vasculitis.  \n\n**Discharge medications:** aspirin, Procardia XL (metoprolol), and labetalol."
