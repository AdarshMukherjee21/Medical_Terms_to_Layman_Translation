  "medical": "PROCEDURES: 1. Robotic-assisted pyeloplasty. 2. Anterograde right ureteral stent placement. 3. Transposition of anterior crossing vessels on the right. 4. Nephrolithotomy. DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction. DRAINS: 1. Jackson-Pratt drain times one from the right flank. 2. Foley catheter times one. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 30 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. SPECIMENS: 1. Renal pelvis. 2. Kidney stones. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries. Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out. After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated. Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used. The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used. Sequential compression devices were also placed. Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test. A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas. Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus. The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen. Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed. The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks. Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially. Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum. At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered. Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection. It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole. These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied. Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out. The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected. Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated. A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient. At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis. The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors. Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section. We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion. 3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis. Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures. Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde. This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter. This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision. Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures. Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis. Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures. Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum. Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point. There was no obvious urine extravasation. At this time, the procedure was terminated. The robot was undocked. Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion. Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this. Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.",
  "layman": "**PROCEDURES**  \n1. Robot‑assisted repair of the kidney’s opening (pyeloplasty).  \n2. Placement of a tube (stent) inside the right ureter moving from the kidney toward the bladder (anterograde).  \n3. Moving two blood vessels that cross the kidney so they no longer press on the kidney’s opening.  \n4. Removal of kidney stones (nephrolithotomy).  \n\n**DIAGNOSIS**  \nBlockage where the ureter meets the kidney on the right side (right ureteropelvic junction obstruction).  \n\n**DRAINS**  \n1. One Jackson‑Pratt drain near the right kidney.  \n2. One Foley catheter in the bladder.  \n\n**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**  \nLess than 30 cc.  \n\n**COMPLICATIONS**  \nNone.  \n\n**SPECIMENS**  \n1. Tissue from the kidney’s collecting area (renal pelvis).  \n2. Kidney stones.  \n\n**INDICATIONS**  \nA 30‑year‑old white man had blood in his urine. Imaging showed stones in his right kidney and a wide collecting system with two blood vessels crossing the kidney. After discussing options, he chose surgery.  \n\n**PROCEDURE IN DETAIL**  \nThe patient was identified with an armband and the plan—robotic right pyeloplasty with stone removal—was confirmed. He was given general anesthesia and antibiotics. He was positioned on his right side with the right flank up. All pressure points were padded and a right‑arm holder was used. The patient was slightly flexed and a kidney rest was placed. Compression devices were attached.  \n\nThe surgical area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes using iodine. A small needle (Veress) was inserted near the belly button to create a gas‑filled space (pneumoperitoneum) with CO₂. A 12‑mm camera port was placed near the belly button. The camera was inserted and no bowel injury was seen. Additional ports—a 12‑mm assist, a 5‑mm liver‑retraction, and another 5‑mm assist—were placed under direct vision. The robot was docked and the instruments were checked.  \n\nThe surgeon first moved the right colon away from the abdominal wall. The right side of the duodenum was cauterized to access the area behind the stomach. The right kidney was then seen and the outer layer (fascia) was opened. The kidney’s collecting area (renal pelvis) and the upper part of the ureter were carefully dissected with cautery and blunt tools. Two blood vessels crossing the kidney were identified—one near the middle‑bottom and one at the lower pole. They were carefully dissected and looped.  \n\nA small incision was made in the renal pelvis with cautery and the contents were suctioned out. The incision was widened to see the kidney’s collecting system. Each major calyx was inspected and washed. Four round stones were removed and sent for analysis.  \n\nThe surgeon then separated the upper part of the ureter from the remaining renal pelvis. The ureter was cut and spatulated with scissors. The excess part of the renal pelvis was removed and sent for permanent section. The lowest part of the renal pelvis was identified and a heel stitch was placed to join the ureter to the pelvis in a semi‑running fashion. 3‑0 Monocryl sutures were used to reattach the ureter to the pelvis. The rest of the incision was closed with 2‑0 Monocryl sutures.  \n\nBefore finishing, a 6×28 ureteral stent was placed from the kidney toward the bladder. The stent was guided over a wire that was inserted under direct vision. The wire was removed once the stent was in place and the curl in the kidney was confirmed. The incision was closed again with 2‑0 Monocryl sutures.  \n\nThe surgeon then moved the crossing blood vessel so it no longer pressed on the kidney’s opening, fixing it with Vicryl sutures. The vessel’s pulse was checked. The outer layer of the kidney (Gerota’s fascia) and the right side of the peritoneum were closed with Vicryl sutures. Hemostasis was good and no urine leak was seen. The robot was removed. All 8‑ and 12‑mm ports were closed at the fascia level with 0 Vicryl sutures. Skin incisions were closed with 4‑0 Monocryl in a subcuticular stitch, Dermabond and band‑aids were applied. A Jackson‑Pratt drain was placed near the kidney and an additional small incision on the right flank. The patient tolerated the surgery well and had no immediate complications.  \n\n**DISPOSITION**  \nThe patient was sent to the post‑anesthesia care unit and then to the genitourinary floor to start recovery."
