  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis with atrophic right testis. PROCEDURES: Examination under anesthesia, diagnostic laparoscopy, right orchiectomy, and left testis fixation. ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block. FLUID RECEIVED: 250 mL of crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMEN: The tissue sent to Pathology was right testicular remnant. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Closed ring on right with atrophic vessels going into the ring and there was obstruction at the shoulder of the ring. Left had open appearing ring but the scrotum was not filled and vas and vessels going into the ring. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a right nonpalpable undescended testis. The plan is for evaluation and repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. The patient was placed in supine position and examined. The left testis well within scrotum. The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check. The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped. An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage. We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl. We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system. We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy. We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg. There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found. Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures. Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide. A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac. The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring. There was no apparent testicular tissue. We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent. We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic. We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation. Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum. At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated procedure well, and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The boy’s right testicle cannot be felt and has not moved into the scrotum.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The right testicle was not found and the remaining tissue was small and atrophic.  \n\nPROCEDURES: The child was examined while asleep, a laparoscopy was done to look inside the abdomen, the remaining right testicle was removed, and the left testicle was moved into the scrotum.  \n\nANESTHESIA: The child received general inhaled anesthesia and a caudal block.  \n\nFLUID RECEIVED: 250 mL of crystalloid solution.  \n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.  \n\nSPECIMEN: The tissue removed from the right side was sent to pathology.  \n\nABNORMAL FINDINGS: On the right side a closed ring was seen with small, atrophic blood vessels and a blockage at the ring’s shoulder. On the left side the ring was open, but the scrotum was not filled and the vessels and vas were present.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: A 2‑year‑old boy has a right testicle that cannot be felt and has not descended. The plan was to examine and repair the problem.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The boy was taken to the operating room, checked for correct identification, and given anesthesia. A caudal block was placed. He was laid on his back. The left testicle was in the scrotum. The right testicle could not be felt even after several attempts. The surgical area was cleaned and covered. A small feeding tube was inserted into the bladder through the urethra for drainage. An incision was made below the belly button. Using a Hasson technique, the abdominal wall was opened and a 5‑mm laparoscope was inserted. A 0‑degree lens was used. The abdomen was inflated with carbon dioxide to 12 mmHg. No bleeding was seen. The surgeon looked for the testicle. The right side had a closed ring with vessels but no testicle. The left side had an open ring with vessels and a vas. Because no testicle was found inside the abdomen, the gas was removed and the abdominal wall was closed with sutures. The skin was closed with subcutaneous stitches. A curved incision was made in the upper right scrotum. The tissue was dissected with electrocautery. The sac was opened, the tunica vaginalis was seen and pulled up to the external ring. No testicular tissue was found. The surgeon removed the remaining tissue, tied off the cord with a 4‑0 Vicryl suture, and marked the base of the tissue. The subdartos area was closed with 4‑0 chromic sutures. A similar incision was made on the left side to move the left testicle into the scrotum. The testicle had a type III attachment to the epididymis and measured about 3–4 mL, larger than expected for a 2‑year‑old. The upper part of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4‑0 chromic purse‑string suture, the testicle was placed back into the scrotum, and the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous layers were closed with 4‑0 chromic. At the end, the child received IV Toradol, Dermabond was applied to both incisions, and the left testicle was in the scrotum. The child tolerated the procedure well and was stable when transferred to recovery."
