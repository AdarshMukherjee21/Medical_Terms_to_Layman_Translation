  "medical": "CC: Rapidly progressive amnesia. HX: This 63 y/o RHM presented with a 1 year history of progressive anterograde amnesia. On presentation he could not remember anything from one minute to the next. He also had some retrograde memory loss, in that he could not remember the names of his grandchildren, but had generally preserved intellect, language, personality, and calculating ability. He underwent extensive evaluation at the Mayo Clinic and an MRI there revealed increased signal on T2 weighted images in the mesiotemporal lobes bilaterally. There was no mass affect. The areas mildly enhanced with gadolinium. PMH: 1) CAD; MI x 2 (1978 and 1979). 2) PVD; s/p aortic endarterectomy (3/1991). 3)HTN. 4)Bilateral inguinal hernia repair. FHX/SHX: Mother died of a stroke at age 58. Father had CAD and HTN. The patient quit smoking in 1991, but was a heavy smoker (2-3ppd) for many years. He had been a feed salesman all of his adult life. ROS: Unremarkable. No history of cancer. EXAM: BP 136/75 HR 73 RR12 T36.6 MS: Alert but disoriented to person, place, time. He could not remember his birthdate, and continually asked the interviewer what year it was. He could not remember when he married, retired, or his grandchildren's names. He scored 18/30 on the Follutein's MMSE with severe deficits in orientation and memory. He had moderate difficulty naming. He repeated normally and had no constructional apraxia. Judgement remained good. CN: unremarkable. Motor: Full strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: Intact to LT/PP/PROP Coordination: unremarkable. Station: No pronator drift, truncal ataxia or Romberg sign. Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 3+ throughout with downgoing plantar responses bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. STUDIES: MRI Brain revealed hyperintense T2 signal in the mesiotemporal regions bilaterally, with mild enhancement on the gadolinium scans. MRI and CT of the chest and CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or tumor. EEG was normal awake and asleep. Antineuronal antibody screening was unremarkable. CSF studies were unremarkable and included varicella zoster, herpes zoster, HIV and HTLV testing, and cytology. The patient underwent stereotactic brain biopsy at the Mayo Clinic which showed inflammatory changes, but no organism or etiology was concluded. TFT, B12, VDRL, ESR, CRP, ANA, SPEP and Folate studies were unremarkable. Neuropsychologic testing revealed severe anterograde memory (verbal and visual)loss, and less severe retrograde memory loss. Most other cognitive abilities were well preserved and the findings were consistent with mesiotemporal dysfunction bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Limbic encephalitis secondary to cancer of unknown origin. He was last seen 7/26/96. MMSE 20/30 and category fluency 20 . Disinhibited affect. Mild right grasp reflex. The clinical course was benign and non-progressive, and unusual for such a diagnosis, though not unheard of .",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Rapidly worsening memory loss.  \n\n**History:** A 63‑year‑old man came to the Mayo Clinic with a one‑year history of getting worse short‑term memory. He could not remember anything that happened even a minute earlier. He also had some trouble recalling past events, such as the names of his grandchildren, but his thinking, speaking, personality, and math skills were still good.  \n\nHe had a long medical history that includes:  \n1. Coronary artery disease and two heart attacks (1978, 1979).  \n2. Peripheral vascular disease; had an aortic endarterectomy in 1991.  \n3. High blood pressure.  \n4. Two inguinal hernia repairs.  \n\nFamily history: Mother died of a stroke at 58; father had heart disease and high blood pressure.  \nHe quit smoking in 1991 after smoking 2–3 packs a day for many years. He worked as a feed salesman his whole adult life.  \n\n**Review of systems:** No problems reported. No cancer history.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 136/75, heart rate 73, breathing 12, temperature 36.6°C.  \n- He was awake and alert but confused about who he was, where he was, and when it was. He could not remember his birthdate and kept asking what year it was. He did not remember when he married, when he retired, or his grandchildren’s names.  \n- Mini‑Mental State Exam score 18/30, showing big problems with orientation and memory. He had some trouble naming objects. He could repeat words normally and draw shapes fine. Judgment was good.  \n- Neurologic exam: normal cranial nerves, full muscle strength, normal tone and bulk, normal sensation, normal coordination, no drift or balance problems, normal gait, normal reflexes (3+ with normal plantar responses).  \n- General exam: normal.  \n\n**Studies:**  \n- Brain MRI: bright spots on T2 images in the mesiotemporal areas on both sides, with mild enhancement after gadolinium. No mass.  \n- Chest and abdominal CT: no swollen lymph nodes or tumors.  \n- EEG: normal while awake and asleep.  \n- Blood tests for antineuronal antibodies, thyroid, B12, VDRL, ESR, CRP, ANA, SPEP, folate, and CSF studies (including tests for varicella, herpes, HIV, HTLV, and cytology) were all normal.  \n- A stereotactic brain biopsy showed inflammation but no clear cause or organism.  \n\n**Neuropsychology:** Severe new memory loss (both verbal and visual), less severe loss of older memories. Other thinking skills were mostly intact, consistent with problems in the mesiotemporal brain areas.  \n\n**Impression:** Limbic encephalitis likely caused by an unknown cancer. The last visit was July 26, 1996. At that time his MMSE was 20/30 and he could name 20 items. He had a mild disinhibited mood and a slight right hand reflex. The disease course was mild and did not get worse, which is unusual for this diagnosis but can happen."
