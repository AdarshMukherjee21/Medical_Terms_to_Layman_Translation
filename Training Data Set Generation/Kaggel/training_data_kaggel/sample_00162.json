  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation. INDICATION: Sacroiliac joint pain. INFORMED CONSENT: The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks. The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in writing. The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. PROCEDURE: Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure. The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback. The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated. The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine. The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement. Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3. Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement. The following technique was used to confirm correct placement. Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration. No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts. Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached. At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue. After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds. All injected medications were preservative free. Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. ADDITIONAL DETAILS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISCUSSION: Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable. The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day. The patient was told to resume all medications. The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function. Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Radiofrequency ablation was performed on both sides of the L5, S1, S2, and S3 nerves.  \n**Reason:** Pain in the sacroiliac joint.  \n\n**Informed Consent:**  \nThe doctor explained the risks, benefits, and other options. The patient could ask questions about the procedure, why it was needed, and the possible risks. Risks discussed included infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, puncturing the dura (the outer covering of the spinal cord), headache, nerve damage, spinal cord injury, and heart or brain side effects if medication entered a blood vessel. The patient was also told about possible reactions to the drugs used during the procedure, such as sedatives, painkillers, contrast dye, anesthetics, and steroids. The information was given both verbally and in writing. The patient understood and agreed to have the procedure.  \n\n**Procedure Details:**  \n- The patient’s oxygen level and vital signs were watched continuously.  \n- The patient stayed awake to help the doctor feel for any problems.  \n- A technician, supervised by the doctor, ran the X‑ray machine.  \n- The patient lay face‑down on the table with a pillow under the chest and head turned.  \n- The skin around the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small opening for the needle.  \n- X‑ray was used to find the bones of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and to plan the needle path.  \n- The skin, fat, and muscle along the planned path were numbed with 1% lidocaine.  \n- A 20‑gauge, 10‑mm bent needle was guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  \n- X‑ray confirmed the needle was in the right spot.  \n- Motor stimulation (2 Hz, 1 ms) was used; no limb movement was seen at less than 2 volts, confirming correct placement.  \n- The needle was removed, and a syringe with 1% lidocaine was attached.  \n- At each level, after checking that no blood was drawn back, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to numb the branch and surrounding tissue.  \n- Then a lesion was made at that level with a temperature of 80 °C for 90 seconds.  \n- All medications had no preservatives.  \n- Sterile technique was used throughout.  \n\n**Additional Details:** None.  \n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**Discussion:**  \nAfter the procedure, vital signs and oxygen levels were stable. The patient was sent home with instructions to apply ice to the injection site for 15–20 minutes, up to twice an hour, for the next day and to avoid hard activities for one day. The patient was told to keep taking all regular medications. Rest was advised for one day, after which normal activities could resume. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical help if they experienced shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, changes in feeling or movement, or changes in bowel or bladder function. A follow‑up appointment was scheduled at the PM&R Spine Clinic in about one to two weeks."
