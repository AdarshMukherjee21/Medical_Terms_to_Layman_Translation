  "medical": "CYSTOSCOPY & VISUAL URETHROTOMY OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual manner under satisfactory general anesthesia. A Storz urethrotome sheath was inserted into the urethra under direct vision. Visualization revealed a stricture in the bulbous urethra. This was intubated with a 0.038 Teflon-coated guidewire, and using the straight cold urethrotomy knife, it was incised to 12:00 to allow free passage of the scope into the bladder. Visualization revealed no other lesions in the bulbous or membranous urethra. Prostatic urethra was normal for age. No foreign bodies, tumors or stones were seen within the bladder. Over the guidewire, a #16-French Foley catheter with a hole cut in the tip with a Cook cutter was threaded over the guidewire and inserted into the bladder and inflated with 10 mL of sterile water. He was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "The patient was laid on their back, cleaned, and given general anesthesia. A urethrotome sheath was inserted into the urethra. The surgeon saw a narrowing in the bulbous part of the urethra. A guidewire was placed through the narrowing, and a cold knife was used to cut the scar tissue at the 12‑o’clock position so the scope could pass into the bladder. No other problems were found in the bulbous or membranous urethra, and the prostatic urethra looked normal for the patient’s age. No foreign objects, tumors, or stones were seen in the bladder. A #16‑French Foley catheter was threaded over the guidewire, inserted into the bladder, and its balloon was inflated with 10 mL of sterile water. The patient was sent to recovery in stable condition."
