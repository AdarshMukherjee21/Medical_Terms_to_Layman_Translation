  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis, gangrenous. PROCEDURE: Appendectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room under urgent conditions. After having obtained an informed consent, he was placed in the operating room and under anesthesia. Followed by a time-out process, his abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Antibiotics had been given prior to incision. A McBurney incision was performed and it carried out through the peritoneal cavity. Immediately there was purulent material seen in the area. Samples were taken for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic sets. The appendix was markedly swollen particularly in its distal three-fourth, where the distal appendix showed an abscess formation and devitalization of the wall. There was quite a bit of local peritonitis. The mesoappendix was clamped, divided and ligated, and then the appendix was ligated and divided, and the stump buried with a pursestring suture of Vicryl and then a Z stitch. The area was abundantly irrigated with normal saline and also the pelvis. The distal foot of small bowel had been explored and because it delivered itself __________ the incision and showed no pathology. Then the peritoneal and internal fascia were approximated with a suture of 0 Vicryl and then the incision was closed in layers and after each layer the wound was irrigated with normal saline. The skin was closed with a combination of a subcuticular suture of fine Monocryl followed by the application of Dermabond. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was minimal, and the patient was sent to the recovery room for recovery in satisfactory condition.",

After the patient gave informed consent, he was put under anesthesia. The surgical team performed a safety “time‑out” check, then cleaned and covered the abdomen in the usual way. Antibiotics were given before the incision.\n\nA small incision (McBurney incision) was made and cut through the abdominal wall into the belly cavity. Immediately pus was seen. Samples were taken to test for bacteria. The appendix was very swollen, especially the lower three‑quarters, where it had an abscess and the wall was dead. There was also a lot of inflammation in the surrounding belly lining (peritonitis).\n\nThe blood vessels and tissue that supply the appendix (mesoappendix) were clamped, cut, and tied off. The appendix was then tied and cut, and the remaining stump was closed with a purse‑string stitch using Vicryl, followed by a Z‑shaped stitch. The area was washed thoroughly with normal saline, including the pelvis. The lower part of the small intestine was checked and was normal. The belly lining and deeper tissues were sewn together with 0 Vicryl, and the incision was closed in layers, rinsing with saline after each layer. The skin was closed with a fine Monocryl stitch under the skin, and Dermabond was applied on top.\n\nThe patient tolerated the operation well. Blood loss was minimal. He was sent to the recovery room in good condition."
