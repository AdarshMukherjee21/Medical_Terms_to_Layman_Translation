  "medical": "CC: Weakness. HX: This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. MEDS: none. PMH: see above. FHX: Father with Von Hippel-Lindau Disease. SHX: retired truck driver. smokes 1-3 packs of cigarettes per day, but denied alcohol use. He is divorced and has two sons who are healthy. He lives with his mother. ROS: noncontributory. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Thought process lucid and appropriate. CN: unremarkable exept for 4+/4+ strength of the trapezeii. No retinal hemangioblastoma were seen. MOTOR: 4-/4- strength in proximal and distal upper extremities. There is diffuse atrophy and claw-hands, bilaterally. He is unable to manipulate hads to any great extent. 4+/4+ strength throughout BLE. There is also diffuse atrophy throughout the lower extremities though not as pronounced as in the upper extremities. SENSORY: There was a right T3 and left T8 cord levels to PP on the posterior thorax. Decreased LT in throughout the 4 extremities. COORD: difficult to assess due to weakness. Station: BUE pronator drift. Gait: stands without assistance, but can only manage to walk a few steps. Spastic gait. Reflexes: Hyperreflexic on left (3+) and Hyporeflexic on right (1). Babinski signs were present bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: 9/8/95, GS normal. By 11/14/95, he required NGT feeding due to dysphagia and aspiration risk confirmed on cookie swallow studies.MRI Brain, 2/19/96, revealed several lesions (hemangioblastoma) in the cerebellum and brain stem. There were postoperative changes and a cyst in the medulla. On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna. The largest of which measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 2.0cm. There are also several large ring enhancing lesions in cerebellum. The lesions were felt to be consistent with hemangioblastoma. No surgical or medical intervention was initiated. Visiting nursing was provided. He has since been followed by his local physician",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Weakness.  \n\n**History:**  \nA 30‑year‑old man who had been healthy until July 1993 began to feel weakness in his right arm and neck pain. He first saw a chiropractor, and after some time his right hand became smaller and stiff. He then saw a neurosurgeon. A CT scan of his neck on September 25, 1992 showed a growth inside the spinal cord at levels C2‑C3 and another outside the cord at C6‑C7. He had surgery (laminectomy from C6 to T1) to remove the growth and relieve pressure on the cord. His symptoms got better for about three months, then got worse again. He developed tingling on the left side and weakness in both arms (right worse than left). He also had trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and very strong reflexes.  \n\nOn August 31, 1993 an MRI of his cervical spine showed the neck and upper back were enlarged and there were several bright spots in the back part of the brain. On September 1, 1993 he had a brain surgery (suboccipital craniotomy) to remove a tumor and a biopsy. The tumor was a hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stopped getting worse after that. He then received radiation: 5,040 cGy in 28 sessions to his brain and 3,600 cGy in 20 sessions to his cervical and thoracic spine from September 1993 to January 19, 1994.  \n\nHe was seen in the NeuroOncology clinic on October 26, 1995 to discuss chemotherapy. He reported that all four arms and legs were getting weaker, especially the muscles near the shoulders, and he had trouble swallowing. He could not put on his shirt or raise his arms easily and could not feed himself with utensils. He could climb stairs but had trouble going down them. He had no bowel or bladder problems. He takes no medications.  \n\nPast medical history is as described above. Family history: his father had Von Hippel‑Lindau disease. Social history: retired truck driver, smokes 1‑3 packs of cigarettes a day, no alcohol. He is divorced, has two healthy sons, and lives with his mother. Review of systems was normal.  \n\n**Physical Exam (October 26, 1995):**  \nVital signs normal. He was alert and oriented. Speech was clear. Thought process normal.  \n- **Cranial nerves:** normal except his trapezius muscles had normal strength (4+/4+). No eye tumors.  \n- **Motor:** Upper arms and hands had 4‑/4‑ strength; hands were very small and had claw‑hand deformities on both sides, making it hard to use them. Both legs had 4+/4+ strength. Lower limbs were smaller than usual but less affected than the arms.  \n- **Sensory:** He could feel pain at the right T3 level and left T8 level on the back of his chest. Light touch was decreased in all four limbs.  \n- **Coordination:** Hard to test because of weakness.  \n- **Station:** Upper arms drifted when he tried to hold them straight.  \n- **Gait:** He could stand alone but could only walk a few steps; his walking was spastic.  \n- **Reflexes:** Left side reflexes were very strong (3+); right side were weak (1). Babinski sign was present on both feet.  \n- **General exam:** normal.  \n\n**Course:**  \n- September 8, 1995: General status normal.  \n- By November 14, 1995 he needed a feeding tube because he could not swallow safely and had a risk of choking. A swallow test with a cookie confirmed this.  \n- MRI of the brain on February 19, 1996 showed several hemangioblastoma lesions in the cerebellum and brainstem, plus changes from surgery and a cyst in the medulla.  \n- On October 25, 1996 he had about a week of numbness in both legs from the middle thighs down to the toes, and worsening leg weakness. He developed pressure sores on his buttocks. He had occasional urinary retention for a month, shortness of breath, and swallowing problems. He was mostly sitting because he could not move well and had no daytime help. His exam matched his complaints. He had no sweating, headaches, or high blood pressure.  \n- MRI of the cervical‑thoracic spine on October 26, 1996 showed a large fluid cavity (syrinx) in the spinal cord extending down to T10. It also showed evidence of his previous C6‑T1 surgery and swelling of the cord at that level. Multiple nodular lesions inside the spinal canal and in the space around the brainstem were seen; the biggest measured 1.1 × 1.0 × 2.0 cm. There were also several ring‑shaped lesions in the cerebellum. These were thought to be hemangioblastomas. No surgery or medication was started. Visiting nursing care was provided. He has since been followed by his local doctor."
