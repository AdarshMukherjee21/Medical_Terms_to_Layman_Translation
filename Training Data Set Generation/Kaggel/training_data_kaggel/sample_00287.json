PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of distal biceps tendon, right elbow. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR, Room #2 and administered a general anesthetic. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity. The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. Tourniquet time was 74 minutes. A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin. Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery. Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated. The _________ was identified. It was incised. The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found. There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture. This area was suctioned clean. The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface. At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon. Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture. Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously. The radial tuberosity was palpated. Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow. A skin incision was made over this area. Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split. A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa. The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision. At this point, they were placed to the side. Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated. The tuberosity came into view. The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection. Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity. Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture. The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution. A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole. The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated. The suture was tied over the bone islands. Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples. The anterior incision was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin was approximated with small staples. Both wounds were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia. A bulky fluff dressing was applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position. Tourniquet was inflated prior to application of the splint. Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately. The patient was awakened. He was rather boisterous during his awakening, but care was taken to protect the right upper extremity. He was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.",

The right arm was cleaned and covered in the usual sterile way. A sterile tourniquet was placed on the upper part of the arm. The arm was raised and blood was removed with an Esmarch bandage, then the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. The tourniquet was on for 74 minutes.  \n\nA curved incision was made in the front of the right elbow, down through the skin. Bleeding was stopped with electrocautery. The fat under the skin was separated and the skin flaps were lifted. The biceps tendon was found and cut open. A finger was placed up the front of the arm and the lower part of the biceps tendon was located. There was some clear‑red fluid from the previous tear, which was suctioned clean. The ends of the biceps tendon were put over a sterile tongue blade and then sharply cut about 5–7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface.  \n\nA #2 fiber wire was passed through the tendon. Two fiber wires were used in a Krackow‑type stitch. After this, the surgeon went down into the front of the elbow along the path where the biceps tendon had been. The radial tuberosity was felt. Just inside the ulna side of it, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and used to lift the skin on the radial side of the elbow. A skin cut was made over this area. About two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split. A suture was then attached through the tip of that suture and passed back up through the front of the elbow. The ends of the fiber wire stitch were grabbed and pulled down through the second incision and were then placed to the side.  \n\nAttention was turned to exposing the radial tuberosity with the forearm fully turned inward. The tuberosity was seen. The edges were cleared with a periosteal elevator and sharp dissection. Using a power bur, a trough about 1.5 cm wide by 7–8 mm deep was made in the radial tuberosity. Three small drill holes were then made along the edge for passing the stitch. The area was washed thoroughly with gentamicin solution. A #4‑0 pull‑out wire was used to pass the stitches through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole. The elbow was bent and the tendon was pulled into the trough with the forearm turned outward. The stitch was tied over the bone islands.  \n\nBoth wounds were washed thoroughly with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. The muscle fascia was closed with a running #2‑0 Vicryl stitch on the outer incision, then the skin was closed with interrupted #2‑0 Vicryl and small staples. The front incision was closed with interrupted #2‑0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue and then skin was closed with small staples. Both wounds were given a total of 30 cc of 0.25 % Marcaine for pain relief after surgery.  \n\nA bulky foam dressing was put on the elbow, followed by a long‑arm plaster splint keeping the forearm turned outward. The tourniquet was inflated before the splint was applied. Blood flow returned to the arm immediately. The patient woke up. He was a bit loud when he woke, but care was taken to protect the right arm. He was then taken to the recovery room in good condition."
