Hallux interphalangeus, right foot. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, right foot. 2. Akin bunionectomy, right toe with internal wire fixation. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 51-year-old female presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself NPO since mid night for a surgery on her painful bunion through her right foot. The patient has a history of gradual onset of a painful bunion over the past several years. She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes, accommodative padding on an outpatient basis with Dr. X all of which have provided inadequate relief. At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the Webril. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion. The foot was elevated off the table. Esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected. A sterile Betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate. Attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion. A #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer. All superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery. Next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade. The capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound. A hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head. The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation. Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it. A sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion. Standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex. The capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head. Nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved. The bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate. Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment. A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard AO technique. Excellent rigid fixation was achieved. A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head. Again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight. The temporary fixation was removed. A medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw. The foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present. A sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge. A distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy was done. After the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy. A #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone. A #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone. The monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole. The foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved. Next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces. Copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint. Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer. Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer. #5-0 Vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion. Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint. The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She is to be partial weightbearing with crutches. She is to follow with Dr. X. She was given emergency contact numbers and instructions to call if problems arise. She was given prescription for Vicodin ES #25 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn one p.o. b.i.d. 500 mg. She was discharged in stable condition.",

Bunion of the first toe (hallux interphalangeus) on the right foot.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. Bunion on the right foot.  \n2. Bunion of the first toe on the right foot.  \n\n**Procedures performed**  \n1. Bunion removal with a cut in the first metatarsal bone and internal screw fixation on the right foot.  \n2. Akin bunion removal on the right toe with internal wire fixation.  \n\n**Anesthesia**  \nTotal intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with local block.  \n\n**History**  \nA 51‑year‑old woman came to the pre‑op area after fasting since midnight for surgery on her painful right bunion. She has had a gradually worsening bunion for several years. She tried wide shoes and padding with her doctor, but they did not help enough. She now wants surgery. The risks and benefits were explained in detail by her doctor, and she gave written consent.  \n\n**Procedure details**  \nAfter an IV line was started, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the table lying on her back. A safety strap was put around her waist. A large amount of a local anesthetic (Webril) was applied to the right ankle, and a pneumatic tourniquet was put on the ankle.  \n\nThe anesthesiologist gave her IV sedation and then injected 15 cc of a 1:1 mix of 0.5 % Marcaine and 1 % Lidocaine into her foot using a standard block technique. The foot was lifted off the table. Esmarch bandages were used to remove blood from the foot. The tourniquet pressure was set to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered into the surgical field, and a sterile stocking was removed. A sterile Betadine solution was wiped away with a sponge, and a toothpick was used to confirm the anesthesia was working.  \n\nThe surgeon examined the first metatarsophalangeal joint (the big‑toe joint). It was tight, turned outward, and had limited motion. A 4‑cm incision was made on the top of the foot with a #10 blade, then deepened with a #15 blade. All small blood vessels were cauterized. A straight cut was made through the joint capsule with a #15 blade. The capsule was lifted on both sides, and the head of the metatarsal bone was brought out of the wound. A thick bump on the inside of the bone was removed with a saw, taking care not to damage the bone head. The inside of the bone had some erosion.  \n\nA 0.45‑inch K‑wire was inserted, slightly bending the bone to avoid shortening it. A long‑arm osteotomy (cut) was made with a saw. The surgeon also released the lateral side of the joint and freed the fibular sesamoid complex. The head of the bone was moved outward and pressed onto the remaining bone. Good alignment and bone contact were achieved. The bone stock was a little less, but enough.  \n\nA 0.45‑inch K‑wire was used to hold the bone temporarily. A 2.7 × 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was placed using standard technique, giving strong fixation. A second 2.0 × 80 mm fully threaded cortical screw was also placed at the top of the bone head, again giving strong fixation. The temporary wire was removed.  \n\nAn overhanging piece of bone on the inside was cut away with a saw. The foot was loaded, and the big toe showed a bunion deformity. A saw cut a wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a hinge on the side. A second cut was made parallel to the nail base, completing a standard Akin osteotomy. The wedge was removed, and the bone was closed with counter‑pressure. Two holes were drilled on the inside of the bone, and a thin wire was looped through and tightened. The toe looked straight and had better motion.  \n\nThe surgeon smoothed all bone surfaces with rasps and flushed the joint with sterile saline. The capsule and periosteum were stitched with #3‑0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4‑0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with #5‑0 Vicryl in a running stitch. A small amount of dexamethasone was injected into the joint. Steri‑Strips were applied, followed by a standard dressing of Owen silk, 4 × 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The tourniquet was released, and the toes flushed with blood.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the anesthesia and surgery without complications. She was moved to the recovery unit with stable vital signs and good blood flow to the right foot. She will be allowed partial weight‑bearing with crutches and will follow up with her doctor. She was given emergency contact numbers and told to call if problems arise. She received a prescription for Vicodin ES #25 (take one pill every 4–6 hours as needed for pain) and Naprosyn 500 mg twice daily. She was discharged in stable condition."
