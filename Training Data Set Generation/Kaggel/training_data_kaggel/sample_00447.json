DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was electively taken to the operating room. In same day surgery, Dr. X applied a magnet to the pacemaker defibrillator that the patient has to change it into a fixed mode and to protect the device from the action of the cautery. Informed consent was obtained, and the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed and the patient under general endotracheal anesthesia was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Local anesthesia was used as a field block and then an incision was made in the left inguinal area and carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis, which was opened. The cord was isolated and protected. It was dissected out. The lipoma of the cord was removed and the sac was high ligated. The main hernia was a direct hernia due to weakness of the floor. A Bassini repair was performed. We used a number of interrupted sutures of 2-0 Tevdek __________ in the conjoint tendon and the ilioinguinal ligament. The external oblique muscle was approximated same as the soft tissue with Vicryl and then the skin was closed with subcuticular suture of Monocryl. The dressing was applied and the patient tolerated the procedure well, estimated blood loss was minimal, was transferred to recovery room in satisfactory condition.",

On the same day, Dr. X used a magnet to change the pacemaker defibrillator to a fixed mode and protect it from the cautery. The patient gave informed consent and was taken to the operating room. A time‑out was performed. The patient received general anesthesia through a breathing tube. The area was cleaned and covered in the usual way. Local anesthesia was given as a field block. An incision was made in the left groin and cut down to the outer layer of the abdominal wall. The spermatic cord was carefully separated and protected. The cord’s fatty tissue (lipoma) was removed and the hernia sac was tied off high. The main hernia was a direct type caused by a weak floor. A Bassini repair was done. Several 2‑0 Tevdek stitches were placed in the conjoint tendon and the ilioinguinal ligament. The outer abdominal muscle was sewn back together with Vicryl, and the skin was closed with a subcuticular Monocryl stitch. A dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the surgery well, lost only a small amount of blood, and was sent to the recovery room in good condition."
