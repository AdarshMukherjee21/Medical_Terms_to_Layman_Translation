  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute infected olecranon bursitis, left elbow. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Infection, left olecranon bursitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Incision and drainage, left elbow. 2. Excision of the olecranon bursa, left elbow. ANESTHESIA: Local with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. NEEDLE AND SPONGE COUNT: Correct. SPECIMENS: Excised bursa and culture specimens sent to the microbiology. INDICATION: The patient is a 77-year-old male who presented with 10-day history of pain on the left elbow with an open wound and drainage purulent pus followed by serous drainage. He was then scheduled for I&D and excision of the bursa. Risks and benefits were discussed. No guarantees were made or implied. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate sedation was achieved, the left elbow was injected with 0.25% plain Marcaine. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. On examination of the left elbow, there was presence of thickening of the bursal sac. There was a couple of millimeter opening of skin breakdown from where the serous drainage was noted. An incision was made midline of the olecranon bursa with an elliptical incision around the open wound, which was excised with skin. The incision was carried proximally and distally. The olecranon bursa was significantly thickened and scarred. Excision of the olecranon bursa was performed. There was significant evidence of thickening of the bursa with some evidence of adhesions. Satisfactory olecranon bursectomy was performed. The wound margins were debrided. The wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac irrigation lavage system mixed with antibiotic solution. There was no evidence of a loose body. There was no bleeding or drainage. After completion of the bursectomy and I&D, the skin margins, which were excised were approximated with 2-0 nylon in horizontal mattress fashion. The open area of the skin, which was excised was left _________ and was dressed with 0.25-inch iodoform packing. Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias. The patient tolerated the procedure very well. He was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications noticed.",

A cut was made and the pus was drained from the left elbow.  \n2. The infected bursa was removed from the left elbow.  \n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with sedation.  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \n\nNEEDLE AND SPONGE COUNT: Correct.  \n\nSPECIMENS: The removed bursa and samples for culture were sent to the lab.  \n\nINDICATION: A 77‑year‑old man had been having pain in his left elbow for 10 days. He had an open wound that first drained thick pus and then clear fluid. He was scheduled for drainage and removal of the bursa. The risks and benefits were explained, and no guarantees were made.  \n\nPROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room. After he was comfortably sedated, a local anesthetic (0.25% plain Marcaine) was injected into the left elbow. The arm was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nOn the elbow, the bursa was thickened and there was a small skin opening where fluid had been draining. A midline cut was made over the bursa, and the skin around the opening was removed. The cut was extended up and down the elbow. The bursa was found to be thick and scarred, with some scar tissue sticking to it. The bursa was fully removed.  \n\nThe edges of the wound were cleaned and washed with a Pulsavac irrigation system that used an antibiotic solution. No loose pieces of tissue were found. There was no bleeding or drainage.  \n\nAfter the bursa was removed and the wound cleaned, the skin edges that had been cut were stitched together with 2‑0 nylon in a horizontal mattress stitch. The open skin area that was removed was left open and covered with a 0.25‑inch iodoform packing. Sterile dressings (Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias) were applied.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the surgery well. He was taken out of sedation and moved to the recovery room in stable condition. No complications were seen during the operation."
