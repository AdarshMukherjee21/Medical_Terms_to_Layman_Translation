  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT SHOULDER CLINICAL:This is a 69-year-old male with pain in the shoulder. Evaluate for rotator cuff tear. FINDINGS: Examination was performed on 9/1/05. There is marked supraspinatus tendinosis and extensive tearing of the substance of the tendon and articular surface, extending into the myotendinous junction as well. There is still a small rim of tendon along the bursal surface, although there may be a small tear at the level of the rotator interval. There is no retracted tendon or muscular atrophy (series #6 images #6-17). Normal infraspinatus tendon. There is subscapularis tendinosis with fraying and partial tearing of the superior most fibers extending to the level of the rotator interval (series #9 images #8-13; series #3 images #8-14). There is no complete tear, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy. There is tendinosis and superficial tearing of the long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove, and there is high grade (near complete) partial tearing of the intracapsular portion of the tendon. The biceps anchor is intact. There are degenerative changes in the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no fracture or subluxation. There is degeneration of the superior labrum and there is a small nondisplaced tear in the posterior superior labrum at the one to two oclock position (series #6 images #12-14; series #3 images #8-10; series #9 images #5-8). There is a small sublabral foramen at the eleven oclock position (series #9 image #6). There is no osseous Bankart lesion. Normal superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments. There is hypertrophic osteoarthropathy of the acromioclavicular joint with narrowing of the subacromial space and flattening of the superior surface of the supraspinatus musculotendinous junction, which in the appropriate clinical setting is an MRI manifestation of an impinging lesion (series #8 images #3-12). Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments. There is minimal fluid within the glenohumeral joint. There is no atrophy of the deltoid muscle. IMPRESSION: There is extensive supraspinatus tendinosis and partial tearing as described. There is no retracted tendon or muscular atrophy, but there may be a small tear along the anterior edge of the tendon at the level of the rotator interval, and this associated partial tearing of the superior most fibers of the subscapularis tendon. There is also a high-grade partial tear of the long biceps tendon as it courses under the transverse humeral ligament. There is no evidence of a complete tear or retracted tendon. Small nondisplaced posterior superior labral tear. Outlet narrowing from the acromioclavicular joint, which in the appropriate clinical setting is an MRI manifestation of an impinging lesion.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** MRI of the left shoulder  \n**Clinical:** A 69‑year‑old man has shoulder pain. The MRI is being used to look for a rotator cuff tear.  \n\n**Findings:**  \nThe scan was taken on 9/1/05.  \n- The supraspinatus tendon (one of the rotator cuff tendons) shows heavy wear (tendinosis) and a large tear that goes through the tendon and the joint surface, reaching the muscle‑tendon junction. A thin strip of tendon still remains on the outer surface, but there may be a small tear where the tendon meets the rotator interval. The tendon has not pulled back and the muscle is not wasted.  \n- The infraspinatus tendon is normal.  \n- The subscapularis tendon (another rotator cuff tendon) has wear and fraying, with a partial tear of the upper fibers that extends to the rotator interval. The tendon has not completely torn, there is no gap or muscle wasting.  \n- The long head of the biceps tendon shows wear and a superficial tear in the groove where it sits, and a near‑complete partial tear of the part of the tendon inside the joint. The biceps anchor (where it attaches to bone) is still intact.  \n- The greater tuberosity of the humerus (the bone where the rotator cuff attaches) shows degenerative changes but no break or displacement.  \n- The superior labrum (the cartilage rim of the shoulder socket) is worn, with a small, non‑displaced tear in the posterior superior part at the 1–2 o’clock position. There is also a small opening (sublabral foramen) at the 11 o’clock position. No bone Bankart lesion is seen.  \n- The superior, middle, and inferior glenohumeral ligaments are normal.  \n- The acromioclavicular joint shows thickening (hypertrophic osteoarthropathy) and the space under the acromion is narrowed, with flattening of the upper part of the supraspinatus tendon‑muscle junction. In this clinical context, this is a sign of an impinging lesion.  \n- The coracoacromial, coracohumeral, and coracoclavicular ligaments are normal.  \n- There is a small amount of fluid in the shoulder joint.  \n- The deltoid muscle shows no wasting.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- Extensive wear and partial tearing of the supraspinatus tendon, with no tendon pullback or muscle wasting. A small tear may be present along the front edge of the tendon at the rotator interval, and the upper fibers of the subscapularis tendon are also partially torn.  \n- A high‑grade partial tear of the long head of the biceps tendon under the transverse humeral ligament.  \n- No complete tear or tendon pullback.  \n- A small, non‑displaced tear of the posterior superior labrum.  \n- Narrowing of the space from the acromioclavicular joint, which in this setting is a sign of an impinging lesion."
