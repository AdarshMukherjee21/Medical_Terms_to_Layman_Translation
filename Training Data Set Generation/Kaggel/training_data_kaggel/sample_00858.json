  "medical": "2-D STUDY 1. Mild aortic stenosis, widely calcified, minimally restricted. 2. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy but normal systolic function. 3. Moderate biatrial enlargement. 4. Normal right ventricle. 5. Normal appearance of the tricuspid and mitral valves. 6. Normal left ventricle and left ventricular systolic function. DOPPLER 1. There is 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation easily seen, but no aortic stenosis. 2. Mild tricuspid regurgitation with only mild increase in right heart pressures, 30-35 mmHg maximum. SUMMARY 1. Normal left ventricle. 2. Moderate biatrial enlargement. 3. Mild tricuspid regurgitation, but only mild increase in right heart pressures.",
  "layman": "**Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)**  \n\n1. The aortic valve has some calcium build‑up and is only slightly narrowed.  \n2. The left ventricle is a little thicker than normal but pumps normally.  \n3. Both atria (upper chambers) are moderately enlarged.  \n4. The right ventricle looks normal.  \n5. The tricuspid and mitral valves look normal.  \n6. The left ventricle and its pumping function are normal.  \n\n**Doppler (blood flow study)**  \n\n1. There is mild to moderate backflow of blood from the aorta (aortic regurgitation) but no narrowing of the aortic valve.  \n2. There is mild backflow from the tricuspid valve, with only a slight rise in pressure in the right side of the heart (30‑35 mmHg maximum).  \n\n**Summary**  \n\n1. The left ventricle is normal.  \n2. Both atria are moderately enlarged.  \n3. Mild tricuspid backflow, with only a mild increase in right‑heart pressure."
