  "medical": "CC: Confusion and slurred speech. HX (primarily obtained from boyfriend): This 31 y/o RHF experienced a &quot;flu-like illness 6-8 weeks prior to presentation. 3-4 weeks prior to presentation, she was found &quot;passed out&quot; in bed, and when awoken appeared confused, and lethargic. She apparently recovered within 24 hours. For two weeks prior to presentation she demonstrated emotional lability, uncharacteristic of her ( outbursts of anger and inappropriate laughter). She left a stove on. She began slurring her speech 2 days prior to admission. On the day of presentation she developed right facial weakness and began stumbling to the right. She denied any associated headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, neck stiffness or visual change. There was no history of illicit drug/ETOH use or head trauma. PMH: Migraine Headache. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Divorced. Lives with boyfriend. 3 children alive and well. Denied tobacco/illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH. ROS: Irregular menses. EXAM: BP118/66. HR83. RR 20. T36.8C. MS: Alert and oriented to name only. Perseverative thought processes. Utilized only one or two word answers/phrases. Non-fluent. Rarely followed commands. Impaired writing of name. CN: Flattened right nasolabial fold only. Motor: Mild weakness in RUE manifested by pronator drift. Other extremities were full strength. Sensory: withdrew to noxious stimulation in all 4 extremities. Coordination: difficult to assess. Station: Right pronator drift. Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2BUE, 3/3BLE, Plantars were flexor bilaterally. General Exam: unremarkable. INITIAL STUDIES: CBC, GS, UA, PT, PTT, ESR, CRP, EKG were all unremarkable. Outside HCT showed hypodensities in the right putamen, left caudate, and at several subcortical locations (not specified). COURSE: MRI Brian Scan, 2/11/92 revealed an old lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia, edema within the head of the left caudate nucleus suggesting an acute ischemic event, and arterial enhancement of the left MCA distribution suggesting slow flow. The latter suggested a vasculopathy such as Moya Moya, or fibromuscular dysplasia. HIV, ANA, Anti-cardiolipin Antibody titer, Cardiac enzymes, TFTs, B12, and cholesterol studies were unremarkable. She underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/12/92. This revealed an occlusion of the left MCA just distal to its origin. The distal distribution of the left MCA filled on later films through collaterals from the left ACA. There was also an occlusion of the right MCA just distal to the temporal branch. Distal branches of the right MCA filled through collaterals from the right ACA. No other vascular abnormalities were noted. These findings were felt to be atypical but nevertheless suspicious of a large caliber vasculitis such as Moya Moya disease. She was subsequently given this diagnosis. Neuropsychologic testing revealed widespread cognitive dysfunction with particular impairment of language function. She had long latencies responding and understood only simple questions. Affect was blunted and there was distinct lack of concern regarding her condition. She was subsequently discharged home on no medications. In 9/92 she was admitted for sudden onset right hemiparesis and mental status change. Exam revealed the hemiparesis and in addition she was found to have significant neck lymphadenopathy. OB/GYN exam including cervical biopsy, and abdominal/pelvic CT scanning revealed stage IV squamous cell cancer of the cervix. She died 9/24/92 of cervical cancer.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: confusion and slurred speech.  \nHistory (mostly from boyfriend): A 31‑year‑old woman had a flu‑like illness 6–8 weeks before she came to the hospital. Three to four weeks before, she was found unconscious in bed; when she woke up she was confused and very tired. She seemed to get better within a day. For the two weeks before she came in, she behaved unusually, having sudden anger and laughing at inappropriate times. She left a stove on. Two days before admission she started slurring her words. On the day she came to the hospital she developed weakness on the right side of her face and began to stumble to the right. She said she had no headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, stiff neck, or vision problems. She had never used illegal drugs, alcohol, or had a head injury.  \n\nPast medical history: migraine headaches.  \nFamily history: none notable.  \nSocial history: divorced, lives with boyfriend, has three healthy children, does not smoke or use drugs, drinks alcohol rarely. She has irregular periods.  \n\nExamination: blood pressure 118/66, heart rate 83, breathing 20, temperature 36.8 °C.  \nMental status: she was awake and could name herself but had trouble staying on topic, spoke in short phrases, and rarely followed instructions. She could not write her name.  \nNeurologic exam: only a slight droop on the right side of her face. Her right arm had mild weakness that made it drift when she tried to hold it straight. All other limbs were normal. She could feel pain in all four limbs. Coordination was hard to test. Reflexes were normal. General exam was normal.  \n\nInitial tests (blood count, chemistry, urinalysis, clotting tests, inflammation markers, ECG) were all normal. A CT scan from another hospital showed low‑density spots in the right putamen, left caudate, and other deep brain areas.  \n\nAn MRI on February 11, 1992 showed an old small stroke in the right basal ganglia, swelling in the left caudate nucleus indicating a recent stroke, and slow blood flow in the left middle cerebral artery. These findings suggested a blood vessel disease such as Moyamoya or fibromuscular dysplasia. Tests for HIV, ANA, anti‑cardiolipin antibodies, heart enzymes, thyroid function, vitamin B12, and cholesterol were all normal.  \n\nA cerebral angiogram on February 12, 1992 showed a blockage in the left middle cerebral artery just beyond its start; the lower part of that artery filled with blood from the left anterior cerebral artery. The right middle cerebral artery also had a blockage near the temporal branch, but its lower branches filled from the right anterior cerebral artery. No other vessel problems were seen. The pattern was unusual but raised suspicion for a large‑vessel vasculitis such as Moyamoya disease, which was given as the diagnosis.  \n\nNeuropsychological testing showed widespread thinking problems, especially with language. She took a long time to answer and only understood simple questions. Her emotional response was flat and she seemed unconcerned about her illness. She was sent home without any medication.  \n\nIn September 1992 she was readmitted with sudden right‑side weakness and changes in mental status. Examination confirmed the weakness and she also had enlarged neck lymph nodes. An OB/GYN exam, cervical biopsy, and abdominal/pelvic CT scan revealed stage IV squamous cell cervical cancer. She died on September 24, 1992, from cervical cancer."
