  "medical": "EXAM: Ultrasound carotid, bilateral. REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Pain. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Bilateral common carotid arteries/branches demonstrate minimal, predominantly noncalcified plaquing with mild calcific plaquing in the left internal carotid artery. There are no different colors or spectral Doppler waveform abnormalities. PARAMETRIC DATA: Right CCA PSV 0.72 m/s. Right ICA PSV is 0.595 m/s. Right ICA EDV 0.188 m/s. Right vertebral 0.517 m/s. Right IC/CC is 0.826. Left CCA PSV 0.571 m/s, left ICA PSV 0.598 m/s. Left ICA EDV 0.192 m/s. Left vertebral 0.551 m/s. Left IC/CC is 1.047. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for clinically significant stenosis. 2. Minimal, predominantly soft plaquing.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Ultrasound of both carotid arteries.  \nREASON: Pain.  \nCOMPARISON: No previous study.  \n\nFINDINGS: Both common carotid arteries and their branches show only a small amount of plaque, mostly soft. There is a little hard plaque in the left internal carotid artery. The blood flow looks normal, with no unusual colors or wave patterns.  \n\nPARAMETRIC DATA (speed of blood flow):  \n- Right common carotid: 0.72 m/s  \n- Right internal carotid: 0.595 m/s (peak), 0.188 m/s (end‑diastole)  \n- Right vertebral: 0.517 m/s  \n- Right internal carotid / common carotid ratio: 0.826  \n\n- Left common carotid: 0.571 m/s  \n- Left internal carotid: 0.598 m/s (peak), 0.192 m/s (end‑diastole)  \n- Left vertebral: 0.551 m/s  \n- Left internal carotid / common carotid ratio: 1.047  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. No significant narrowing of the arteries.  \n2. Only a small amount of mainly soft plaque."
