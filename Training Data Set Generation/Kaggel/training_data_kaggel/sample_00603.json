BRIEF DESCRIPTION: The patient was brought to the operating room and anesthesia was induced. The abdomen was prepped and draped and ports were placed. The gallbladder was grasped and retracted. The cystic duct and cystic artery were circumferentially dissected and a critical view was obtained.

The gallbladder fossa and clips were examined and looked good with no evidence of bleeding or bile leak. The ports were removed under direct vision with good hemostasis. The Hasson was removed. The abdomen was desufflated. The gallbladder in its endo catch bag was removed. The ports were closed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see full hospital dictation.",

The belly was cleaned and covered, and small tubes (ports) were inserted. The surgeon grabbed the gallbladder and pulled it out of the way. The surgeon carefully separated the small duct and artery that supply the gallbladder, making sure to see all the important structures. The duct and artery were clipped twice and cut. The gallbladder was then cut away from the liver using a small electric tool and placed in a bag for removal. The area where the gallbladder was attached and the clips were checked and looked fine, with no bleeding or leaking bile. The tubes were taken out while watching the area to make sure there was no bleeding. The initial opening (Hasson) was closed. The belly was released of gas. The gallbladder bag was taken out. The tubes were closed. The patient handled the surgery well. Please see the full hospital notes."
