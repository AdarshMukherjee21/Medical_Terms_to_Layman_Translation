  "medical": "HISTORY: A is a 55-year-old who I know well because I have been taking care of her husband. She comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy. Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal. Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy. I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so. She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain. She has had no hematochezia. She denies any melena. She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history. Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says. She does not know exactly what was done. It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists. This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done. She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital. Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses. She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says. MEDICATIONS: Reglan 10 mg once a day. ALLERGIES: She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says. SOCIAL HISTORY: She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day. She was counseled to quit. She occasionally uses alcohol. She has never used illicit drugs. She is married, is a housewife, and has four children. FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes and cancer. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Essentially as mentioned above. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: A is a healthy appearing female in no apparent distress. VITAL SIGNS: Her vital signs reveal a weight of 164 pounds, blood pressure 140/90, temperature of 97.6 degrees F. HEENT: No cervical bruits, thyromegaly, or masses. She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally. NEURO: No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four. ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy. We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers. She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well. I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed. We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience.",
  "layman": "**History**  \nA is a 55‑year‑old woman I know well because I have been caring for her husband. She came to talk about getting a screening colonoscopy. Her last colonoscopy was in 2002 and was basically normal. She has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years, so she wants a repeat test. I told her the timing was right and that it made sense. She says she hasn’t lost or gained weight unexpectedly. She has never had bright red blood in her stool (hematochezia) or black, tarry stool (melena). She says her bowel habits are the same, but sometimes her stools are thin.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \nWe reviewed her whole health history. She had stomach surgery for ulcers in 1974, but she doesn’t remember exactly what was done. It was at a hospital in California that no longer exists, so it’s hard to find the records. She also had her gallbladder and appendix removed in the 1970s at the same hospital. She has no major medical illnesses, only mild gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying).\n\n**Medications**  \n- Reglan 10 mg once a day\n\n**Allergies**  \nShe says she has no drug allergies, but she is sensitive to medications that can cause ulcers.\n\n**Social History**  \nShe still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day and was advised to quit. She drinks alcohol occasionally. She has never used illegal drugs. She is married, a housewife, and has four children.\n\n**Family History**  \nPositive for diabetes and cancer.\n\n**Review of Systems**  \nEssentially the same as described above.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- **General**: Healthy‑looking woman, no obvious distress.  \n- **Vitals**: Weight 164 lb, blood pressure 140/90, temperature 97.6 °F.  \n- **HEENT**: No neck bruit, no enlarged thyroid, no masses. No swollen lymph nodes in the head, neck, or armpits.  \n- **Lungs**: Clear, no wheezes or crackles.  \n- **Heart**: Regular rhythm, no murmurs.  \n- **Abdomen**: Soft, not tender, no swelling.  \n- **Extremities**: No blue discoloration, clubbing, or swelling; good pulses in both wrists.  \n- **Neurologic**: No focal problems; feels normal to light touch in all four limbs.\n\n**Assessment and Recommendations**  \nGiven her history and exam, she would benefit from both an upper and lower endoscopy. We don’t know her exact stomach anatomy; if she had an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers. She also reports significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years. I explained the risks (over‑sedation, perforation, dehydration) and benefits of the procedures, and she wants to proceed. We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at a convenient time."
