  "medical": "PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Botulinum toxin injection bilateral rectus femoris, medial hamstrings, and gastrocnemius soleus muscles, phenol neurolysis of bilateral obturator nerves, application of bilateral short leg fiberglass casts. PROCEDURE CODES: 64640 times two, 64614 time two, 95873 times two, 29405 times two. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, 343.0. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, 343.0. ANESTHESIA: MAC. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient's mom. The patient was brought to minor procedures and sedated per their protocol. The patient was positioned lying supine. Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine. The obturator nerves were identified lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse with active EMG stimulation. Approximately 4 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location bilaterally. Phenol injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus. Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol. Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified with active EMG stimulation. Approximately 50 units was injected in the rectus femoris bilaterally, 75 units in the medial hamstrings bilaterally and 100 units in the gastrocnemius soleus muscles bilaterally. Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 450 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL. After injections were performed, bilateral short leg fiberglass casts were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURES PERFORMED: The doctor injected botulinum toxin into both rectus femoris, medial hamstring, and gastrocnemius‑soleus muscles. They also injected phenol to block the obturator nerves on both sides and then put short leg fiberglass casts on both legs. PROCEDURE CODES: 64640 twice, 64614 twice, 95873 twice, 29405 twice. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (ICD‑10 343.0). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same. ANESTHESIA: Moderate‑level anesthesia (MAC). COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: The patient’s mother gave permission. The patient was taken to the minor procedures room and sedated according to the hospital’s protocol. The patient lay on their back. The skin over the injection sites was cleaned with chlorhexidine. The obturator nerves were found next to the adductor longus tendon and below the femoral pulse using EMG stimulation. About 4 mL of 5 % phenol was injected on each side at the spot where the hip adductor muscles contracted the most and with the least stimulation needed. Blood was withdrawn before each phenol injection. The muscles that received botulinum toxin were located with EMG stimulation. About 50 units were injected into each rectus femoris, 75 units into each medial hamstring, and 100 units into each gastrocnemius‑soleus muscle. In total, 450 units of botulinum toxin were given, diluted to 25 units per milliliter. After all injections, short leg fiberglass casts were applied to both legs. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications occurred."
