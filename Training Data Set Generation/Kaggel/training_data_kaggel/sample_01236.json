  "medical": "PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Carpal tunnel release. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: Nerve conduction study tests diagnostic of carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient failed to improve satisfactorily on conservative care, including anti-inflammatory medications and night splints. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and, following a Bier block to the operative arm, the arm was prepped and draped in the usual manner. Utilizing an incision that was laid out to extend not more distally than the thumb web space or proximally to a position short of crossing the most prominent base of the palm and in line with the longitudinal base of the thenar eminence in line with the fourth ray, the soft tissue dissection was carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous fat to the transverse carpal ligament. It was identified at its distal edge. Using a hemostat to probe the carpal tunnel, sharp dissection utilizing scalpel and iris scissors were used to release the carpal tunnel from a distal-to-proximal direction in its entirety. The canal was probed with a small finger to verify no evidence of any bone prominences. The nerve was examined for any irregularity. There was slight hyperemia of the nerve and a slight hourglass deformity. Following an irrigation, the skin was approximated using interrupted simple and horizontal mattress #5 nylon suture. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. The time of the Bier block was 30 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None noted.",

The patient did not get better enough with rest, anti‑inflammatory medicines, and night splints.\n\n**What was done:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room. A Bier block (a type of local anesthesia) was given to the arm. The arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way.  \nA small cut was made that did not go farther down than the space between the thumb and index finger, and not higher than the base of the palm. The cut was lined up with the base of the thumb muscles.  \nThe surgeon cut through the skin and fat straight down to the transverse carpal ligament. The ligament’s lower edge was found. Using a small clamp to feel the tunnel, the surgeon carefully cut the ligament from the bottom up, freeing the whole tunnel. A finger was used to check that no bone bumps were left. The nerve was checked for problems. It was a little red and had a mild “hourglass” shape.  \nAfter washing the area, the skin was stitched together with simple and horizontal mattress stitches using #5 nylon. A sterile dressing was put on.  \nThe patient was moved to recovery in good condition. The Bier block lasted 30 minutes. No complications were seen."
