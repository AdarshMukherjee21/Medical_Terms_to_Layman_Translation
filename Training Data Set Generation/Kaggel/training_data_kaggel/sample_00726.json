  "medical": "CC: Left hemibody numbness. HX: This 44y/o RHF awoke on 7/29/93 with left hemibody numbness without tingling, weakness, ataxia, visual or mental status change. She had no progression of her symptoms until 7/7/93 when she notices her right hand was stiff and clumsy. She coincidentally began listing to the right when walking. She denied any recent colds/flu-like illness or history of multiple sclerosis. She denied symptoms of Lhermitte's or Uhthoff's phenomena. MEDS: none. PMH: 1)Bronchitis twice in past year (last 2 months ago). FHX: Father with HTN and h/o strokes at ages 45 and 80; now 82 years old. Mother has DM and is age 80. SHX: Denies Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP112/76 HR52 RR16 36.8C MS: unremarkable. CN: unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout except for slowing of right hand fine motor movement. There was mildly increased muscle tone in the RUE and RLE. Sensory: decreased PP below T2 level on left and some dysesthesias below L1 on the left. Coord: positive rebound in RUE. Station/Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 3+/3 throughout all four extremities. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Rectal exam not done. Gen exam reportedly &quot;normal.&quot; COURSE: GS, CBC, PT, PTT, ESR, Serum SSA/SSB/dsDNA, B12 were all normal. MRI C-spine, 7/145/93, showed an area of decreased T1 and increased T2 signal at the C4-6 levels within the right lateral spinal cord. The lesion appeared intramedullary and eccentric, and peripherally enhanced with gadolinium. Lumbar puncture, 7/16/93, revealed the following CSF analysis results: RBC 0, WBC 1 (lymphocyte), Protein 28mg/dl, Glucose 62mg/dl, CSF Albumin 16 (normal 14-20), Serum Albumin 4520 (normal 3150-4500), CSF IgG 4.1mg/dl (normal 0-6.2), CSF IgG, % total CSF protein 15% (normal 1-14%), CSF IgG index 1.1 (normal 0-0.7), Oligoclonal bands were present. She was discharged home. The patient claimed her symptoms resolved within one month. She did not return for a scheduled follow-up MRI C-spine.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Numbness on the left side of her body.  \n\n**History:** A 44‑year‑old woman with a history of right‑hand heart failure woke up on July 29, 1993 with numbness on the left side of her body. She had no tingling, weakness, trouble walking, vision changes, or changes in thinking. Her symptoms did not get worse until July 7, 1993, when she noticed her right hand was stiff and clumsy. She also began walking with a slight leaning to the right. She said she had no recent colds or flu‑like illness and no history of multiple sclerosis. She denied feeling the “electric shock” sensation (Lhermitte’s sign) or worsening with heat (Uhthoff’s phenomenon).  \n\n**Medications:** None.  \n\n**Past medical history:** Two episodes of bronchitis in the past year (the last one two months ago).  \n\n**Family history:** Father had high blood pressure and had strokes at ages 45 and 80; he is now 82. Mother has diabetes and is 80 years old.  \n\n**Social history:** No tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.  \n\n**Physical exam (July 29, 1993):**  \n- Blood pressure 112/76 mm Hg, heart rate 52 bpm, breathing 16/min, temperature 36.8 °C.  \n- Mental status and cranial nerves normal.  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 everywhere except the right hand, which had slower fine‑motor movements.  \n- Slightly higher muscle tone in the right arm and right leg.  \n- Sensation: less pain sensation below the T2 level on the left side and some abnormal sensations below L1 on the left.  \n- Coordination: a mild rebound reaction in the right arm.  \n- Gait and balance normal.  \n- Reflexes 3+ in all four limbs.  \n- Plantar responses (foot reflexes) were normal (flexor).  \n- No rectal exam was done.  \n- Genital exam was reported as normal.  \n\n**Course of investigation:**  \n- Blood tests (CBC, coagulation, ESR, antibodies for SSA/SSB/dsDNA, vitamin B12) were all normal.  \n- MRI of the cervical spine (July 15, 1993) showed a spot of low T1 and high T2 signal at the C4‑C6 levels on the right side of the spinal cord. The spot was inside the cord, off‑center, and brightened with contrast.  \n- Lumbar puncture (July 16, 1993) showed: no red cells, 1 white cell (lymphocyte), protein 28 mg/dl, glucose 62 mg/dl, CSF albumin 16 mg/dl (normal 14‑20), serum albumin 45.2 g/dl (normal 31.5‑45.0), CSF IgG 4.1 mg/dl (normal 0‑6.2), IgG 15% of total CSF protein (normal 1‑14%), IgG index 1.1 (normal 0‑0.7). Oligoclonal bands were present.  \n\nShe was sent home. She said her symptoms went away within a month and she did not come back for the scheduled follow‑up MRI of the cervical spine."
