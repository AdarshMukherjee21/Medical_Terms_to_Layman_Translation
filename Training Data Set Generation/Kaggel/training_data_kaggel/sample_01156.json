  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Odynophagia. 2. Dysphagia. 3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease rule out stricture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Antral gastritis. 2. Hiatal hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD with photos and biopsies. GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 75-year-old female who presents with difficulty swallowing, occasional choking, and odynophagia. She has a previous history of hiatal hernia. She was on Prevacid currently. At this time, an EGD was performed to rule out stricture. At the time of EGD, there was noted some antral gastritis and hiatal hernia. There are no strictures, tumors, masses, or varices present. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite in the lateral decubitus position. She was given sedation by the Department Of Anesthesia. Once adequate sedation was reached, the Olympus gastroscope was inserted into oropharynx. With air insufflation entered through the proximal esophagus to the GE junction. The esophagus was without evidence of tumors, masses, ulcerations, esophagitis, strictures, or varices. There was a hiatal hernia present. The scope was passed through the hiatal hernia into the body of the stomach. In the distal antrum, there was some erythema with patchy erythematous changes with small superficial erosions. Multiple biopsies were obtained. The scope was passed through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb and duodenal suite, they appeared within normal limits. The scope was pulled back from the stomach, retroflexed upon itself, _____ fundus and GE junction. As stated, multiple biopsies were obtained. The scope was then slowly withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.",

GERD – rule out a narrowing (stricture)  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. Inflammation of the stomach’s lower part (antral gastritis)  \n2. Hiatal hernia  \n\n**Procedure performed**  \nAn upper endoscopy (EGD) with pictures and tissue samples (biopsies).  \n\n**Findings**  \nThe patient is a 75‑year‑old woman who has trouble swallowing, sometimes chokes, and feels pain when swallowing. She has a history of a hiatal hernia and is taking Prevacid. The endoscopy was done to check for a narrowing. The stomach’s lower part showed inflammation, and a hiatal hernia was present. No narrowing, tumors, masses, or enlarged veins were seen.  \n\n**How the procedure was done**  \nThe patient lay on her side in the endoscopy room and was given sedation. Once she was calm, a small camera (Olympus gastroscope) was inserted through her mouth. Air was pumped in to help see the inside of the esophagus up to the junction with the stomach. The esophagus looked normal – no tumors, lumps, sores, inflammation, narrowing, or veins. A hiatal hernia was seen. The scope was then passed into the stomach. In the lower part of the stomach (antrum) there was redness and a few tiny superficial sores; several tissue samples were taken. The scope moved through the opening (pylorus) into the first part of the small intestine (duodenal bulb) and the rest of the duodenum looked normal. The scope was pulled back, bent back on itself (retroflexed) to look at the upper stomach (fundus) and the junction with the esophagus. More tissue samples were taken. The scope was then slowly withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition."
