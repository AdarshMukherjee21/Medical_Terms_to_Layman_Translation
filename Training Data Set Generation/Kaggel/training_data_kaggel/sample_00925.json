  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left cervical radiculopathy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left cervical radiculopathy. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy. 2. Bone bank allograft. 3. Anterior cervical plate. TUBES AND DRAINS LEFT IN PLACE: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. SPECIMEN SENT TO PATHOLOGY: None. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. INDICATIONS: This is a middle-aged man who presented to me with left arm pain. He had multiple levels of disease, but clinically, it was C6 radiculopathy. We tested him in the office and he had weakness referable to that nerve. The procedure was done at that level. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room at which time an intravenous line was placed. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. He was positioned supine in the operative area and the right neck was prepared. An incision was made and carried down to the ventral spine on the right in the usual manner. An x-ray confirmed our location. We were impressed by the degenerative change and the osteophyte overgrowth. As we had excepted, the back of the disk space was largely closed off by osteophytes. We patiently drilled through them to the posterior ligament. We went through that until we saw the dura. We carefully went to the patient's symptomatic, left side. The C6 foramen was narrowed by uncovertebral joint overgrowth. The foramen was open widely. An allograft was placed. An anterior Steffee plate was placed. Closure was commenced. The wound was closed in layers with Steri-Strips on the skin. A dressing was applied. It should be noted that the above operation was done also with microscopic magnification and illumination.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pain and weakness in the left arm caused by a pinched nerve in the neck.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as before – left neck nerve compression.  \n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:  \n1. Removed part of the disc between the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae (C5‑C6).  \n2. Placed a bone graft from a donor.  \n3. Attached an anterior cervical plate to hold the spine in place.  \n\nTUBES AND DRAINS LEFT IN PLACE: None.  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \nSPECIMEN SENT TO PATHOLOGY: None.  \nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with a breathing tube.  \n\nINDICATIONS:  \nA middle‑aged man came to see me with pain in his left arm. He had several levels of spinal disease, but the symptoms matched a problem at the C6 level. In the office we found weakness that matched that nerve. The surgery was done at that level.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, an IV line was started, and general anesthesia was given. He lay on his back and the right side of his neck was cleaned. A small cut was made and the surgeon went down to the front of the spine on the right side. An X‑ray confirmed the correct spot. The surgeon saw the disc had worn down and bone spurs had grown over it. The back of the disc space was mostly blocked by these spurs. The surgeon carefully drilled through the spurs to reach the back ligament, then went through it until the spinal cord was seen. The surgeon then worked on the left side, where the opening for the nerve (the C6 foramen) was narrowed by bone overgrowth. The opening was widened, a donor bone graft was placed, and an anterior Steffee plate was attached. The wound was closed in layers, skin strips were applied, and a dressing was put on. The operation was performed with a microscope for better view and lighting."
