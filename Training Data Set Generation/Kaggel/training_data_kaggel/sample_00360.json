  "medical": "INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a complex set of procedures which requires appropriate positioning and immobilization typically with customized immobilization devices. The treatment planning process requires at least 4 hours of physician time. The technology is appropriate in this patient's case due to the fact that the target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures. Sequential CT scans are obtained and transferred to the treatment planning software. Extensive analysis occurs. The target volumes, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected. In addition, organs at risk are outlined. Doses are selected both for targets, as well as for organs at risk. Associated dose constraints are placed. Inverse treatment planning is then performed in conjunction with the physics staff. These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician. Multiple beam arrangements may be tested for appropriateness and optimal dose delivery in order to maximize the chance of controlling disease, while minimizing exposure to organs at risk. This is performed in hopes of minimizing associated complications. The physician delineates the treatment type, number of fractions and total volume. During the time of treatment, there is extensive physician intervention, monitoring the patient set up and tolerance. In addition, specific QA is performed by the physics staff under the physician's direction. In view of the above, the special procedure code 77470 is deemed appropriate.",
  "layman": "INTENSITY‑MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY\n\nIntensity‑modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a detailed set of steps that needs the patient to be positioned and held still, usually with a custom‑made support device. The planning process takes at least four hours of a doctor’s time. This technique is used for this patient because the tumor is close to sensitive organs.\n\nThe doctor orders a series of CT scans that are sent to the planning computer. The team carefully studies the images. They outline the tumor area, adding extra space for possible movement or hidden cancer cells. They also outline nearby organs that could be harmed. The doctor chooses the radiation dose for the tumor and for the nearby organs, and sets limits on how much dose those organs can receive. The physics team then creates a plan that delivers the right dose from different angles. The doctor reviews and approves the plan. Several beam arrangements may be tried to find the best balance of killing the cancer while sparing healthy tissue, aiming to reduce side effects.\n\nThe doctor decides the type of treatment, how many sessions (fractions) it will have, and the total dose. During each treatment session, the doctor closely watches the patient’s setup and comfort. The physics staff also performs quality checks under the doctor’s guidance. Because of all these steps, the special procedure code 77470 is used."
