  "medical": "EXAM: Lumbar spine CT without contrast. HISTORY: Back pain after a fall. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial images were acquired through the lumbar spine. Coronal and sagittal reconstruction views were also obtained. FINDINGS: There is no evidence for acute fracture or subluxation. There is no spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. The central canal and neuroforamen are grossly patent at all levels. There are no abnormal paraspinal masses. There is no wedge/compression deformity. There is intervertebral disk space narrowing to a mild degree at L2-3 and L4-5. Soft tissue windows demonstrate atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta, which is not dilated. There was incompletely visualized probable simple left renal cyst, exophytic at the lower pole. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for acute fracture or subluxation. 2. Mild degenerative changes. 3. Probable left simple renal cyst.",
  "layman": "EXAM: CT scan of the lower back without contrast.  \nHISTORY: Back pain after a fall.  \nTECHNIQUE: Images were taken in slices through the lower spine. Extra views were made from the side and front.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n- No new broken bones or dislocations.  \n- No cracks or slipping of the vertebrae.  \n- The spinal canal and nerve openings are open at all levels.  \n- No unusual growths near the spine.  \n- No compression of the vertebrae.  \n- The spaces between the vertebrae are slightly narrowed at L2‑3 and L4‑5.  \n- The abdominal aorta shows plaque buildup but is not enlarged.  \n- A likely simple cyst was seen on the lower part of the left kidney, but it was not fully seen.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. No new fractures or dislocations.  \n2. Mild wear‑and‑tear changes.  \n3. Possible simple cyst on the left kidney."
