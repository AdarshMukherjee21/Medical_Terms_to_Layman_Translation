  "medical": "TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained through the cervical spine without contrast. Additional high resolution coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were also obtained for better visualization of the osseous structures. FINDINGS: The cervical spine demonstrates normal alignment and mineralization with no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis. The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained. The central canal is patent. The pedicles and posterior elements are intact. The paravertebral soft tissues are within normal limits. The atlanto-dens interval and the dens are intact. The visualized lung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute abnormalities.",
  "layman": "**Technique:** We took a series of CT scans of the neck without using contrast dye. We also made extra high‑resolution images in side‑view and front‑view angles to see the bones more clearly.\n\n**Findings:** The neck bones are straight and have normal bone density. There is no break, slip, or misalignment. The height of each bone and the spaces between them are normal. The spinal canal is open. The small bones that support the spine and the back parts of the vertebrae are intact. The soft tissues next to the spine look normal. The space between the top of the spine and the skull, and the dens (a small bone in the neck), are normal. The upper parts of the lungs that we could see are clear.\n\n**Impression:** No urgent problems were found."
