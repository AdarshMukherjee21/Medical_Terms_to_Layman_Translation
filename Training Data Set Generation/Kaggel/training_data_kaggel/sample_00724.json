PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photo. 2. Insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation and local. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well without difficulty. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 50-year-old African-American male who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/18/2003 secondary to right hemiparesis from a CVA. The patient deteriorated with several CVAs and had became encephalopathic requiring a ventilator-dependency with respiratory failure. The patient also had neuromuscular dysfunction. After extended period of time, per the patient's family request and requested by the ICU staff, decision to place a feeding tube was decided and scheduled for today. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have esophagitis as well as gastritis via EGD and was placed on Prevacid granules. PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family. First, the EGD was to be performed. The Olympus endoscope was inserted through the mouth, oropharynx and into the esophagus. Esophagitis was noted. The scope was then passed through the esophagus into the stomach. The cardia, fundus, body, and antrum of the stomach were visualized. There was evidence of gastritis. The scope was passed into the duodenal bulb and sweep via the pylorus and then removed from the duodenum retroflexing on itself in the stomach looking at the hiatus. Next, attention was made to transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall for the PEG placement. The skin was then anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. The finder needle was then inserted under direct visualization. The catheter was then grasped via the endoscope and the wire was pulled back up through the patient's mouth. The Ponsky PEG tube was attached to the wire. A skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel. The wire was pulled back up through the abdominal wall point and Ponsky PEG back up through the abdominal wall and inserted into position. The endoscope was then replaced confirming position. Photograph was taken. The Ponsky PEG tube was trimmed and the desired attachments were placed and the patient did tolerate the procedure well. We will begin tube feeds later this afternoon.",

Poor nutrition due to low protein and calories.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses:**  \n1. Difficulty swallowing caused by nerve and muscle problems.  \n2. Poor nutrition due to low protein and calories.  \n\n**Procedures performed:**  \n1. Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine with pictures taken.  \n2. Placement of a feeding tube through the belly wall (PEG tube).  \n\n**Anesthesia:** IV sedation and local numbing.  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**Disposition:** The patient tolerated the procedure well.  \n\n**Brief history:**  \nA 50‑year‑old African‑American man came to ABCD General Hospital on 08/18/2003 after a stroke that left his right side weak. He had several more strokes and became confused, needing a ventilator because of breathing problems. He also had nerve and muscle weakness that made swallowing hard. After a long time, the family and ICU staff decided it was best to put in a feeding tube, and the procedure was scheduled for that day.  \n\n**Intra‑operative findings:**  \nThe endoscopy showed inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) and stomach (gastritis). He was started on Prevacid granules.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter the patient and family gave written consent and were told the risks and benefits, the endoscopy was done. An Olympus scope was passed through the mouth, throat, and into the esophagus, where inflammation was seen. It was then passed into the stomach, where the upper part (cardia), middle (body), lower part (fundus), and the area before the stomach emptied (antrum) were examined and inflammation was seen. The scope was then passed into the first part of the small intestine (duodenal bulb) and pulled back through the stomach to look at the opening to the chest (hiatus).  \n\nNext, the team prepared for the PEG tube. The belly wall was lighted from inside the stomach to find the spot. The skin was numbed with 1% lidocaine. A needle was inserted through the belly wall under direct vision. A wire was passed through the needle, then pulled back up through the mouth. The PEG tube was attached to the wire. A small cut was made in the skin with a #11 blade. The wire was pulled back through the belly wall, bringing the PEG tube into place. The endoscope was reinserted to confirm the tube was correctly positioned, and a photo was taken. The PEG tube was trimmed and the necessary attachments were added. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and feeding will start later that afternoon."
