  "medical": "EXAM: CT of the facial bones without contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: Hit in nose. COMPARISON EXAM: Plain films of the same date. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helicoaxial images were acquired in the axial plane and were reconstructed in bone and soft tissue algorithms for viewing in multiplanar format. FINDINGS: There is a fracture of the frontal process of the maxilla on both sides with displacement with angulation to the right and very minimal displacement of the distal fragments. In addition, there is slight comminution of the right nasal bone without displacement. The bony portion of the nasal septum is intact, although it is bowed to the left. Soft tissue swelling is seen overlying the left side of the nose. There is no nasoseptal hematoma. Moderate mucosal thickening is seen in both maxillary sinuses. The right maxillary sinus is hypoplastic. Moderate mucosal thickening is seen in the left ethmoid sinus and marked mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus. The right sphenoid sinus is hypoplastic. No abnormality of the orbits is seen. The imaged portions of the brain are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral fractures of the frontal process of the maxilla and with displacement to the right. 2. The findings were reported to Dr. Xyz of the emergency room on 04/30/07 at 1715 hours.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the facial bones without contrast.  \n**Reason for exam:** Nose hit.  \n**Comparison exam:** X‑ray films taken the same day.  \n\n**Technique:** The scanner took many thin slices of the face in a horizontal plane. These slices were processed to show bone and soft tissue clearly and can be viewed in different directions.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- Both sides of the upper jaw (maxilla) have fractures in the front part that are slightly bent toward the right side. The broken pieces are only slightly moved.  \n- The right side of the nose bone is a little broken into small pieces but the pieces are still in place.  \n- The bony part of the nasal septum (the wall between the nostrils) is intact but curves to the left.  \n- Swelling of the soft tissue is seen over the left side of the nose.  \n- No blood clot is seen in the nasal septum.  \n- The lining of both maxillary sinuses (air pockets behind the cheeks) is thickened. The right maxillary sinus is smaller than normal.  \n- The lining of the left ethmoid sinus (between the eyes) is moderately thickened, and the lining of the left sphenoid sinus (behind the nose) is heavily thickened. The right sphenoid sinus is smaller than normal.  \n- The eye sockets look normal.  \n- The parts of the brain that were seen are normal.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Fractures on both sides of the front part of the upper jaw, bent toward the right.  \n2. These results were reported to Dr. Xyz in the emergency room on 04/30/07 at 5:15 p.m."
