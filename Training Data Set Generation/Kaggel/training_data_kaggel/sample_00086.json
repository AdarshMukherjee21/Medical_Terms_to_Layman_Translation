  "medical": "CC: Progressive lower extremity weakness. HX: This 52y/o RHF had a h/o right frontal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection, on 1/15/1991. She had been healthy until 1/6/91, when she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure during the night. She subsequently underwent an MRI brain scan and was found to have a right frontal enhancing lesion in the mesial aspect of the right frontal lobe at approximately the level of the coronal suture. There was minimal associated edema and no mass effect. Following extirpation of the tumor mass, she underwent radioactive Iodine implantation and 6020cGy radiation therapy in 35 fractions. In 11/91 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy protocols. This was followed by four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (3/92, 6/92, 9/92 ,10/92) chemotherapy. On 10/12/92 she presented for her 4th course of 5FU/Carboplatin and complained of non-radiating dull low back pain, and proximal lower extremity weakness, but was still able to ambulate. She denied any bowel/bladder difficulty. PMH: s/p oral surgery for wisdom tooth extraction. FHX/SHX: 1-2 ppd cigarettes. rare ETOH use. Father died of renal CA. MEDS: Decadron 12mg/day. EXAM: Vitals unremarkable. MS: Unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE, LE: 4+/5- prox, 5/5 distal to hips. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: No deficits appreciated. Coord: Unremarkable. Station: No mention in record of being tested. Gait: Mild difficulty climbing stairs. Reflexes: 1+/1+ throughout and symmetric. Plantar responses were down-going bilaterally. INITIAL IMPRESSION: Steroid myopathy. Though there was enough of a suspicion of &quot;drop&quot; metastasis that an MRI of the L-spine was obtained. COURSE: The MRI L-spine revealed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. No focal mass or cord compression was visualized. CSF examination revealed: 19RBC, 22WBC, 17 Lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, Glucose 56, Protein 150. Cytology (negative). The patient was discharged home on 10/17/92, but experienced worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness and became predominantly wheelchair bound within 4 months. She was last seen on 3/3/93 and showed signs of worsening weakness (left hemiplegia: R &gt; L) as her tumor grew and spread. She then entered a hospice.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: Weakness that is getting worse in her legs.\n\nHistory: A 52‑year‑old woman had a right frontal brain tumor called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The tumor was first found on a brain biopsy and partial removal on January 15, 1991. She was healthy until January 6, 1991, when she had a generalized seizure at night. An MRI then showed a small enhancing lesion in the front part of her right frontal lobe, just below the coronal suture. There was little swelling and no pressure on the brain. After the tumor was removed, she had radioactive iodine placed in the area and received 6,020 cGy of radiation in 35 sessions. In November 1991 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy. She then had four courses of 5‑fluorouracil (5FU) and carboplatin in March, June, September, and October 1992. On October 12, 1992, during her fourth 5FU/carboplatin treatment, she reported dull, non‑radiating low back pain and weakness in the upper part of her legs, but she could still walk. She had no bowel or bladder problems.\n\nPast medical history: Wisdom‑tooth extraction. Family history: 1–2 cigarettes per day, rare alcohol use. Father died of kidney cancer.\n\nMedications: Decadron 12 mg daily.\n\nPhysical exam: Vital signs normal. Muscle strength: 5/5 in both arms. Lower limbs: 4+/5‑ in the upper part, 5/5 in the lower part below the hips. Muscle tone and size normal. Sensation normal. Coordination normal. Gait: slight difficulty climbing stairs. Reflexes 1+ throughout, symmetrical. Plantar reflexes downward on both feet.\n\nInitial impression: Muscle weakness from steroids. Because there was concern for possible spinal tumor spread, an MRI of the lower spine was done.\n\nCourse: The spinal MRI showed a thin line of enhancement along the back of the conus medullaris, suggesting tumor cells in the fluid around the spinal cord. No mass or compression was seen. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis: 19 red cells, 22 white cells (17 lymphocytes, 5 histiocytes), glucose 56, protein 150. Cytology was negative. She was discharged home on October 17, 1992, but her back pain and leg weakness worsened, and she became mostly wheelchair bound within four months. She was last seen on March 3, 1993, with increasing weakness, especially on the left side, as the tumor grew and spread. She then entered hospice care."
