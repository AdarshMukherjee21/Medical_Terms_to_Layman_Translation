  "medical": "CLINICAL HISTORY: Gravida 1, para 0 at 33 weeks 5 days by early dating. The patient is developing gestational diabetes. Transabdominal ultrasound examination demonstrated a single fetus and uterus in vertex presentation. The placenta was posterior in position. There was normal fetal breathing movement, gross body movement, and fetal tone, and the qualitative amniotic fluid volume was normal with an amniotic fluid index of 18.2 cm. The following measurements were obtained: Biparietal diameter 8.54 cm, head circumference 30.96 cm, abdominal circumference 29.17 cm, and femoral length 6.58 cm. These values predict a fetal weight of 4 pounds 15 ounces plus or minus 12 ounces or at the 42nd percentile based on gestation. CONCLUSION: Normal biophysical profile (BPP) with a score of 8 out of possible 8. The fetus is size appropriate for gestation.",
  "layman": "CLINICAL HISTORY: This is the woman’s first pregnancy (Gravida 1) and she has not yet had a baby (para 0). She is 33 weeks and 5 days pregnant, based on early dating. She is developing gestational diabetes. A transabdominal ultrasound showed one baby in the uterus, positioned head‑down (vertex). The placenta is on the back of the uterus. The baby is breathing, moving, and has normal muscle tone. The amount of amniotic fluid is normal, with an amniotic fluid index of 18.2 cm. The measurements taken were: biparietal diameter 8.54 cm, head circumference 30.96 cm, abdominal circumference 29.17 cm, and femur length 6.58 cm. These measurements estimate the baby’s weight at about 4 lb 15 oz, give or take 12 oz, which is at the 42nd percentile for this stage of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The biophysical profile (BPP) is normal, scoring 8 out of 8. The baby’s size is appropriate for the pregnancy."
