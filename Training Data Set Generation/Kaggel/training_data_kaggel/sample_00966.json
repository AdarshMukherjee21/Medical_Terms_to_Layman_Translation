ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. INDICATIONS: This is an 18-year-old girl with sickle cell anemia who has had symptomatic cholelithiasis. She requested appendectomy because of the concern of future diagnostic dilemma with pain crisis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were recommended to her. The procedure was explained in detail including the risks of bleeding, infection, biliary injury, retained common duct stones. After answering her questions, she wished to proceed and gave informed consent. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table. She was positively identified and the correct surgical site and procedure reviewed. After successful administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the skin of the abdomen was prepped with chlorhexidine solution and sterilely draped. The infraumbilical skin was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and horizontal incision created. The linea alba was grasped with a hemostat and Veress needle was placed into the peritoneal cavity and used to insufflate carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg. A 12-mm expandable disposable trocar was placed and through this a 30 degree laparoscope was used to inspect the peritoneal cavity. Upper abdominal anatomy was normal. Pelvic laparoscopy revealed bilaterally closed internal inguinal rings. Additional trocars were placed under direct vision including a 5-mm reusable in the right lateral _____. There was a 12-mm expandable disposable in the right upper quadrant and a 5-mm reusable in the subxiphoid region. Using these, the gallbladder was grasped and retraced cephalad. Adhesions were taken down over the cystic duct and the duct was circumferentially dissected and clipped at the gallbladder cystic duct junction. A small ductotomy was created. Reddick cholangiogram catheter was then placed within the duct and the balloon inflated. Continuous fluoroscopy was used to instill contrast material. This showed normal common bile duct which entered the duodenum without obstruction. There was no evidence of common bile duct stones. The cholangiogram catheter was removed. The duct was doubly clipped and divided. The artery was divided and cauterized. The gallbladder was taken out of the gallbladder fossa. It was then placed in Endocatch bag and left in the abdomen. Attention was then paid to the appendix. The appendix was identified and window was made in the mesoappendix at the base. This was amputated with an Endo-GIA stapler. The mesoappendix was divided with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler. This was placed in another Endocatch bag. The abdomen was then irrigated. Hemostasis was satisfactory. Both the appendix and gallbladder were removed and sent for pathology. All trocars were removed. The 12-mm port sites were closed with 2-0 PDS figure-of-eight fascial sutures. The umbilical skin was reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl Rapide. The remaining skin incisions were closed with 5-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture. The skin was cleaned. Mastisol, Steri-Strips and band-aids were applied. The patient was awakened, extubated in the operating room, transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",

She also wanted her appendix removed because she was worried it might cause future pain that could be mistaken for a sickle cell crisis. The surgeon explained that the best option was to remove both the gallbladder and the appendix using a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) technique. She was told about possible risks such as bleeding, infection, bile duct injury, and leftover stones in the common bile duct. After answering her questions, she agreed and signed the consent form.  \n\n**What happened during the operation:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, laid on her back, and the correct surgery was confirmed. After she was put under general anesthesia, the belly was cleaned with a chlorhexidine solution and covered with sterile drapes. A small incision was made below the belly button and local anesthetic with epinephrine was injected. A needle was used to create a small space inside the belly by pumping in carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg. A 12‑mm disposable port was inserted, and a 30‑degree camera was used to look inside. The upper abdomen looked normal. The pelvis was examined and both internal groin openings were closed. Additional small ports were placed in the right side of the belly and near the sternum.  \n\nThe surgeon lifted the gallbladder, removed any scar tissue around the cystic duct, and clipped the duct where it joins the gallbladder. A small cut was made in the duct, a catheter was inserted, and a balloon was inflated. Fluoroscopy (real‑time X‑ray) was used to inject contrast dye, showing that the common bile duct was clear and opened into the small intestine without blockage. The catheter was removed. The duct was clipped twice and cut. The cystic artery was also cut and cauterized. The gallbladder was removed from its pocket, placed in a bag, and left in the abdomen.  \n\nThe surgeon then turned to the appendix. The appendix was found and a small opening was made in the tissue that holds it. It was cut off with a stapling device. The tissue holding the appendix was also cut with a vascular stapler and placed in another bag. The belly was washed out, and the surgeon made sure there was no bleeding. Both the gallbladder and appendix were sent to the lab for examination. All ports were removed. The 12‑mm port sites were closed with figure‑of‑eight stitches. The belly button skin was stitched back together with interrupted stitches. The other small incisions were closed with a subcuticular stitch. The skin was cleaned, and a protective dressing (Mastisol, Steri‑Strips, and band‑aids) was applied.  \n\nThe patient woke up, the breathing tube was removed in the operating room, and she was taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
