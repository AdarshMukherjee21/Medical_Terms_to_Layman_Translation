  "medical": "PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy. PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Dysphagia. POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Active reflux esophagitis, distal esophageal stricture, ring due to reflux esophagitis, dilated with balloon to 18 mm. PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure with special attention to benefits, risks, alternatives. Risks explained as bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications. Vital signs were monitored by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Supplemental O2 given. Specifics of the procedure discussed. The procedure was discussed with father and mother as the patient is mentally challenged. He has no complaints of dysphagia usually for solids, better with liquids, worsening over the last 6 months, although there is an emergency department report from last year. He went to the emergency department yesterday with beef jerky. All of this reviewed. The patient is currently on Cortef, Synthroid, Tegretol, Norvasc, lisinopril, DDAVP. He is being managed for extensive past history due to an astrocytoma, brain surgery, hypothyroidism, endocrine insufficiency. He has not yet undergone significant workup. He has not yet had an endoscopy or barium study performed. He is developmentally delayed due to the surgery, panhypopituitarism. His family history is significant for his father being of mine, also having reflux issues, without true heartburn, but distal esophageal stricture. The patient does not smoke, does not drink. He is living with his parents. Since his emergency department visitation yesterday, no significant complaints. Large male, no acute distress. Vital signs monitored in the endoscopy suite. Lungs clear. Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm. Abdomen obese but soft. Extremity exam showed large hands. He was a Mallampati score A, ASA classification type 2. The procedure discussed with the patient, the patient's mother. Risks, benefits, and alternatives discussed. Potential alternatives for dysphagia, such as motility disorder, given his brain surgery, given the possibility of achalasia and similar discussed. The potential need for a barium swallow, modified barium swallow, and similar discussed. All questions answered. At this point, the patient will undergo endoscopy for evaluation of dysphagia, with potential benefit of the possibility to dilate him should there be a stricture. He may have reflux symptoms, without complaining of heartburn. He may benefit from a trial of PPI. All of this reviewed. All questions answered.",
  "layman": "**Procedures Performed:**  \nUpper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy).\n\n**Pre‑procedure Diagnosis:**  \nDifficulty swallowing (dysphagia).\n\n**Post‑procedure Diagnosis:**  \nActive acid reflux causing inflammation of the esophagus, narrowing in the lower esophagus (stricture), a ring‑like narrowing from reflux, and the narrowing was widened with a balloon to 18 mm.\n\n**Procedure Details:**  \nThe patient gave informed consent after the doctor explained the benefits, risks, and alternatives. Risks mentioned included bleeding, infection, a hole in the bowel, pneumonia from inhaling food or liquid, and reactions to the medications. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels were monitored, and extra oxygen was given. The doctor talked through the steps of the procedure with the patient’s parents because the patient has a mental disability. The patient usually has trouble swallowing solids, swallows liquids better, and the problem has gotten worse over the last six months. He had an emergency department visit last year and went to the ED yesterday after eating beef jerky. All of this was reviewed.\n\nThe patient is taking Cortef, Synthroid, Tegretol, Norvasc, lisinopril, and DDAVP. He has a long medical history that includes brain surgery for an astrocytoma, hypothyroidism, and hormone deficiency. He has not had a full work‑up yet, and he has never had an endoscopy or a barium swallow test. He has developmental delays from the brain surgery and has panhypopituitarism. His father also has reflux problems and a narrowing in the lower esophagus, but no heartburn. The patient does not smoke or drink and lives with his parents. Since his ED visit yesterday, he has had no major complaints. He is a large male, not in acute distress. Vital signs were checked in the endoscopy room. His lungs were clear, his heart rhythm was regular, his abdomen was soft but large, and his hands were large. He had a Mallampati score of A and an ASA classification of type 2.\n\nThe doctor discussed the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patient and his mother. Possible other causes of swallowing difficulty, such as a motility disorder related to his brain surgery or conditions like achalasia, were mentioned. The need for a barium swallow or a modified barium swallow was also discussed. All questions were answered. The plan is to perform the endoscopy to evaluate the swallowing problem, with the possibility of dilating the narrowing if needed. He may have reflux symptoms even without heartburn and might benefit from a trial of a proton‑pump inhibitor. All was reviewed and all questions answered."
