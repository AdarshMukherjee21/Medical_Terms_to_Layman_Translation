  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:Left knee pain. FINDINGS: Comparison is made with 10/13/05 radiographs. There is a prominent suprapatellar effusion. Patient has increased signal within the medial collateral ligament as well as fluid around it, compatible with type 2 sprain. There is fluid around the lateral collateral ligament without increased signal within the ligament itself, compatible with type 1 sprain. Medial and lateral menisci contain some minimal increased signal centrally that does not extend through an articular surface and findings are felt to represent minimal myxoid degeneration. No tear is seen. Anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligaments are intact. There is a bone bruise of medial patellar facet measuring approximately 8 x 5 mm. There is suggestion of some mild posterior aspect of the lateral tibial plateau. MR signal on the bone marrow is otherwise normal. IMPRESSION: Type 2 sprain in the medial collateral ligament and type sprain in the lateral collateral ligament. Joint effusion and bone bruise with suggestion of some minimal overlying chondromalacia and medial patellar facet.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the left knee without contrast  \nCLINICAL: The patient has pain in the left knee.  \n\nFINDINGS: The MRI was compared with X‑rays taken on 10/13/05.  \n- There is a noticeable fluid collection above the kneecap (suprapatellar effusion).  \n- The medial collateral ligament (inner knee ligament) shows increased signal and fluid around it, indicating a moderate (type 2) sprain.  \n- The lateral collateral ligament (outer knee ligament) has fluid around it but no signal change in the ligament itself, indicating a mild (type 1) sprain.  \n- Both the medial and lateral menisci (cartilage pads) have small areas of increased signal in the center that do not reach the joint surface; this is thought to be minor wear (myxoid degeneration). No tears are seen.  \n- The anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament are intact.  \n- There is a bone bruise on the inner side of the kneecap (medial patellar facet) measuring about 8 × 5 mm.  \n- There is a slight suggestion of mild damage on the back part of the outer tibial plateau.  \n- Bone marrow signal is otherwise normal.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Moderate sprain of the medial collateral ligament and mild sprain of the lateral collateral ligament. The knee has fluid and a bone bruise, with some minor cartilage wear over the inner side of the kneecap."
