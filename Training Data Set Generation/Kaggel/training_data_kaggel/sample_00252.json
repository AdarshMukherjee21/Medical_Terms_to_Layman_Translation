ANESTHESIA: General NAME OF OPERATION: Bilateral open carpal tunnel release. FINDINGS AT OPERATION: The patient had identical, very thick, transverse carpal ligaments, with dull synovium. PROCEDURE: Under satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine manner on both upper extremities. The right upper extremity was exsanguinated, and the tourniquet inflated. A curved incision was made at the the ulnar base, carried through the subcutaneous tissue and superficial fascia, down to the transverse carpal ligament.

The right arm was first prepared: blood was let out of the arm and a tourniquet was put on. A curved cut was made at the base of the ulna, going through the skin and the outer layer of tissue until reaching the transverse carpal ligament. The ligament was cut open along its inner edge, and the wound was closed with small nylon stitches. The surgeon then injected medicine into the wound and put on a dry, sterile bandage. The same steps were repeated on the left arm. The patient left the operating room feeling fine."
