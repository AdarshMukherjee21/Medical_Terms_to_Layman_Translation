DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room where her right temporal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Xylocaine 1% was utilized and then an incision was made in front of the right ear and deepened anteriorly. The temporal artery was found and exposed in an extension of about 2 cm. The artery was proximally and distally ligated with 6-0 Prolene and also a side branch and a sample was sent for pathology. Hemostasis achieved with a cautery and the incision was closed with a subcuticular suture of Monocryl. Then, the patient was turned and her left temporal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A similar procedure was performed with 1% Xylocaine and exposed her temporal artery, which was excised in an extent to about 2 cm. This was also proximally and distally ligated with 6-0 Prolene and also side branch. Hemostasis was achieved with a cautery and the skin was closed with a subcuticular suture of Monocryl.

The right side of her head was cleaned and covered in the usual way. A local anesthetic (Xylocaine 1%) was applied, and a small cut was made in front of her right ear. The cut was deepened until the temporal artery was seen. About 2 cm of the artery was removed. The artery was tied off at both ends with a 6‑0 Prolene suture, and a side branch was also tied. A tissue sample was sent to the lab. The wound was sealed with cautery and closed with a subcuticular stitch of Monocryl.  \n\nThe patient was then turned over. The left side of her head was cleaned and covered the same way. The same steps were repeated: local anesthetic, incision, removal of about 2 cm of the temporal artery, tying off the artery and a side branch, cautery to stop bleeding, and closing with a Monocryl stitch. Dressings were applied to both cuts.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Blood loss was negligible, and she was sent home the same day for recovery."
