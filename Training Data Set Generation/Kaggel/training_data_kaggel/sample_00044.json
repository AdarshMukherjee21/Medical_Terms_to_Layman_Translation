  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal wall abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal wall abscess. PROCEDURE: Incision and drainage (I&D) of abdominal abscess, excisional debridement of nonviable and viable skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle, then removal of foreign body. ANESTHESIA: LMA. INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 60-year-old gentleman, who initially had a sigmoid colectomy for diverticular abscess, subsequently had a dehiscence with evisceration. Came in approximately 36 hours ago with pain across his lower abdomen. CT scan demonstrated presence of an abscess beneath the incision. I recommended to the patient he undergo the above-named procedure. Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternatives forms of therapy were discussed with him, and he was agreeable to surgery. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have an abscess that went down to the level of the fascia. The anterior layer of the fascia was fibrinous and some portions necrotic. This was excisionally debrided using the Bovie cautery, and there were multiple pieces of suture within the wound and these were removed as well. TECHNIQUE: Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in a sterile fashion. The wound opening where it was draining was explored using a curette. The extent of the wound marked with a marking pen and using the Bovie cautery, the abscess was opened and drained. I then noted that there was a significant amount of undermining. These margins were marked with a marking pen, excised with Bovie cautery; the curette was used to remove the necrotic fascia. The wound was irrigated; cultures sent prior to irrigation and after achievement of excellent hemostasis, the wound was packed with antibiotic-soaked gauze. A dressing was applied. The finished wound size was 9.0 x 5.3 x 5.2 cm in size. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Dressing was applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",

After the surgery, the incision opened and some bowel came out (dehiscence with evisceration). He came to the hospital about 36 hours later with pain in his lower abdomen. A CT scan showed an abscess under the incision. I explained the surgery, its purpose, risks, benefits, possible complications, and other treatment options. He understood and agreed to the operation.  \n\n**Findings:** The abscess reached the fascia (the deep tissue layer). The front part of the fascia was covered in fibrin and some parts were dead tissue. I removed the dead tissue with a cautery device (Bovie) and also removed several pieces of suture that were inside the wound.  \n\n**Technique:** The patient was identified and taken to the operating room. After anesthesia was started, his abdomen was cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes. I used a curette to explore the draining wound and marked its edges with a pen. Using the cautery, I opened the abscess and drained it. I saw a lot of undermining (tissue separation) and marked those edges too. I removed the dead fascia with the curette. The wound was washed, cultures were taken before and after washing, and after stopping bleeding, I packed the wound with gauze soaked in antibiotics. A dressing was applied. The final wound measured 9.0 × 5.3 × 5.2 cm. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery in stable condition."
