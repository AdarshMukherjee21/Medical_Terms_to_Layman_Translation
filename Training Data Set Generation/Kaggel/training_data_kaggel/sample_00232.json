  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT FOOT CLINICAL: A 49-year-old female with ankle pain times one month, without a specific injury. Patient complains of moderate to severe pain, worse with standing or walking on hard surfaces, with tenderness to palpation at the plantar aspect of the foot and midfoot region and tenderness over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. FINDINGS: Received for second opinion interpretations is an MRI examination performed on 05/27/2005. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space extending along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space posterior to the Achilles tendon. Findings suggest altered biomechanics with crural fascial strains. There is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus with mild tendon thickening. There is possible partial surface tearing of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus (axial inversion recovery image #16) which is a possible hypertrophic tear less than 50% in cross sectional diameter. The study has been performed with the foot in neutral position. Confirmation of this possible partial tendon tear would require additional imaging with the foot in a plantar flexed position with transaxial images of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus oriented perpendicular to the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. There is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths consistent with flexor splinting but intrinsically normal tendons. Normal peroneal tendons. There is tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with thickening but no demonstrated tendon tear. Normal extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum tendons. Normal Achilles tendon. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 2cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon. Normal distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex. Normal lateral, subtalar and deltoid ligamentous complexes. There are no erosions of the inferior neck of the talus and there are no secondary findings of a midfoot pronating force. Normal plantar fascia. There is no plantar calcaneal spur. There is venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot extending along the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves which may be acting as intermittent entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves. Normal tibiotalar, subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux was partially excluded from the field-of-view of this examination. IMPRESSION: Tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening and possible surface fraying / tearing of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus, however, confirmation of this finding would require additional imaging. Minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths, consistent with flexor splinting. Edema of the subcutis adipose space along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle suggesting altered biomechanics and crural fascial strain. Mild tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with mild tendon thickening. Normal plantar fascia and no plantar fasciitis. Venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot which may be acting as entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** MRI of the left foot  \n**Clinical:** A 49‑year‑old woman has had ankle pain for about a month. She didn’t have a specific injury. The pain is moderate to severe, worse when she stands or walks on hard surfaces. She feels tenderness when the doctor presses on the bottom of her foot, the middle of the foot, and along the back of the tibialis posterior tendon.\n\n**Findings:**  \nThe MRI was taken on 05/27/2005 for a second opinion.  \n- Swelling (edema) is seen in the fat under the skin on both the inside and outside of the ankle, and behind the Achilles tendon. This suggests that the way her leg moves is altered and that the calf fascia is strained.  \n- The tibialis posterior tendon, which goes around the inside ankle bone, shows signs of wear (tendinosis) and is slightly thickened. There may be a small tear on the front surface of the tendon just below the inside ankle bone. The tear is less than half the tendon’s width. To confirm this, another scan with the foot pointed downward would be needed.  \n- The tendons that flex the toes and the big toe (flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus) have a little inflammation in their sheaths, which is common when the tendons are overused, but the tendons themselves look normal.  \n- The peroneal tendons (on the outside of the ankle) are normal.  \n- The tibialis anterior tendon (front of the shin) shows wear and is thickened, but no tear.  \n- The extensor tendons (lifting the toes) and the Achilles tendon are normal.  \n- The soleus muscle (calf) is low‑lying, reaching close to the Achilles tendon attachment.  \n- All ankle ligaments (tibiofibular, lateral, subtalar, deltoid) are normal.  \n- There are no bone erosions or signs of a midfoot pronation force.  \n- The plantar fascia (bottom of the foot) is normal, with no heel spur.  \n- The veins under the foot are enlarged along the inside and outside plantar nerves, which might intermittently pinch those nerves.  \n- The joint where the big toe meets the foot (metatarsophalangeal joint) was not fully captured in this scan.\n\n**Impression:**  \n- The tibialis posterior tendon has wear, thickening, and possibly a small surface tear just below the inside ankle bone; another scan would confirm this.  \n- Minor inflammation of the tendon sheaths for the toe‑flexing tendons, likely from overuse.  \n- Swelling in the skin fat around the ankle indicates altered movement and calf fascia strain.  \n- Mild wear of the tibialis anterior tendon with thickening.  \n- Normal plantar fascia, no heel spur.  \n- Enlarged plantar veins that may pinch the inside and outside plantar nerves."
