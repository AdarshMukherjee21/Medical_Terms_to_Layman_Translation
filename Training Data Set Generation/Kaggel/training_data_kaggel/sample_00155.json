  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right knee total arthroplasty. ANESTHESIA: The procedure was done under a subarachnoid block anesthetic in the supine position with a tourniquet utilized. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: Approximately 90 minutes. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire procedure is done in the inpatient operating suite in the Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital. The following sizes of NexGen system were utilized: E on right femur, cemented; 5 tibial stem tray with a 10 mm polyethylene insert, and a 32 mm patellar button. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 58-year-old white female suffering increasing right knee pain for number of years prior to surgical intervention. She was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. She had undergone two knee arthroscopies in the years preceding this. They were performed by myself. She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live. Medial compartment had minor changes present. There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides. There was no significant flexion contracture preoperatively. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine upon the operating table after receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department. Thigh tourniquet was placed upon the patient's right leg. She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. The limb was elevated and exsanguinated and tourniquet placed 325 mmHg for the above noted time. A straight incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation. Medial parapatellar arthrotomy was created and the knee cap was everted. The ligaments were balanced. A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was completely removed. Drill hole was made in the distal femur. The size to an E, right. Care was taken to make up for the severe loss of articular cartilage on the posterior condyle in the lateral side. This was checked with the epicondylar abscess and with three degrees of external rotation, drill holes were made. Intramedullary guide was then placed, pegged, and anterior cut carried out. There was excellent resection. It was flat. Distal cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus. Appropriate cuts were carried out. The standard cut was utilized. The finishing guide for E was held with pins as well as screws. Cutting was carried out posterior to anterior, then posterior chamfer and anterior chamfer, femoral sulcus cut was carried out and drill holes for pegs were made. The cutting guide was then removed. The bone was removed. Excess bone was taken out posteriorly. The posterior capsule was loosened up. There were two different fabellas in the posterolateral compartment and they were loosened. Posterolateral corner was then anchored with osteotome and was taken around the posterolateral corner. An extramedullary tibial cutting guide was then placed, pinned, and held. A cut was carried out parallel to the foot. Hard copy ________ was obtained, deemed to be satisfactory after evening up the edges. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. It was necessary to perform a lateral retinacular release to the patella. The patella was isolated. Approximately 10 mm to 11 mm were reamed off. The size to 32 mm button and drill hole guide was placed, impacted, and drilled. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. The tibial guide was then pinned. Drill hole was placed, broached, and utilized. Copious irrigation was carried out. Methylmethacrylate was mixed and was sequentially placed from the femur to the tibia to the patella. The implants were sequentially placed in tibia to femur to patella. Once excess methylmethacrylate was removed and cured, 10 mm Poly was placed. There was excellent ligament balancing. A separate portal was utilized for subcutaneous drain. Tourniquet was deflated and hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation. Interrupted #1 Ethibond suture was utilized for parapatellar closure, running #1 Vicryl suture was utilized for overstitch. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed to the skin. Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing. Digits were pink and warm with brawny pulses distally at the end of the case. The patient was then transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.",

A tourniquet was used on the leg.\n\n**Tourniquet time:**  \nAbout 90 minutes.\n\n**Location:**  \nThe operation took place in the inpatient operating room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.\n\n**Implants used (NexGen system):**  \n- Femur: size E, cemented  \n- Tibia: 5‑mm stem tray with a 10‑mm polyethylene insert  \n- Patella: 32‑mm button\n\n**History and findings:**  \nThe patient is a 58‑year‑old white woman who has had worsening pain in her right knee for several years. She did not get better with non‑surgical treatments. She had two knee arthroscopies before this surgery, both performed by the same surgeon. Those procedures did not help, and her knee developed severe wear and a valgus (knock‑knee) deformity. The outer (lateral) side of the knee collapsed completely, and there were degenerative changes in the femoral groove. The inner (medial) side had only minor changes. The lateral collateral ligament was not tight, but both sides were slightly loose. She did not have a flexion contracture before surgery.\n\n**Operative procedure:**  \nThe patient was placed on her back on the operating table after receiving a spinal block. A thigh tourniquet was applied to her right leg. The leg was cleaned, draped, and the tourniquet was set to 325 mmHg. A straight incision was made through the skin and fat. Bleeding was controlled with an electric cautery device. The surgeon opened the knee by cutting along the inside edge of the patella and turned the kneecap outward. Ligaments were balanced. A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was taken out completely. A hole was drilled into the lower part of the femur. Because the outer side of the knee had lost a lot of cartilage, the surgeon carefully measured and drilled holes with the knee slightly rotated. An intramedullary guide was inserted, fixed, and the femur was cut. The cuts were smooth and flat. A distal cutting guide was set at five degrees of valgus and used to make the appropriate cuts. The guide was secured with pins and screws. Cutting was done from back to front, with chamfers at the back and front. The femoral groove was cut and holes for pegs were made. The guide was removed and excess bone was taken away. The back capsule was loosened. Two small structures in the posterolateral compartment were loosened. The posterolateral corner was prepared and taken around. An external tibial cutting guide was placed, fixed, and a cut was made parallel to the foot. The cut was checked and found satisfactory. A trial range of motion was good. A lateral retinacular release of the patella was performed. The patella was isolated. About 10‑11 mm of bone was removed. A 32‑mm button was placed, guided, and drilled. The trial motion was still good. The tibial guide was fixed, a hole was drilled, and the area was prepared. The surgeon irrigated the joint thoroughly. Bone cement (methylmethacrylate) was mixed and applied from the femur to the tibia to the patella. The implants were placed in the tibia, then femur, then patella. After excess cement was removed and hardened, a 10‑mm polyethylene insert was placed. Ligaments were balanced well. A separate small incision was made for a drain. The tourniquet was released and bleeding was controlled with cautery. The inside of the knee was closed with interrupted #1 Ethibond sutures, and the outer layer was closed with a running #1 Vicryl suture. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with interrupted #2‑0 Vicryl, and skin staples were applied. Compression dressings (Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril) were applied. The fingers were pink, warm, and had good pulses at the end of the case. The patient was moved to the recovery area in good condition. The expected surgical outcome for this patient is fair."
