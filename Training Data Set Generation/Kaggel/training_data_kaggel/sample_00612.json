  "medical": "A survey film of the abdomen shows no soft tissue abnormalities and no pathologic calcifications overlying the renal contours or bladder. Following intravenous infusion of appropriate contrast material, there is prompt symmetrical concentration as noted by nephrograms. No filling defects of the collecting systems are noted on the linear tomograms. There is normal and symmetrical filling of the caliceal system. Subsequent films demonstrate that the kidneys are of normal size and contour bilaterally. The caliceal system and ureters are in their usual position and show no signs of obstruction or intraluminal defects. The postvoid films demonstrate normal emptying of the collecting system, including the urinary bladder. IMPRESSION: Negative intravenous urogram.",
  "layman": "An abdominal X‑ray shows no abnormal soft tissues and no unusual calcium deposits over the kidneys or bladder. After a contrast dye is injected into a vein, the kidneys fill quickly and evenly. The kidney tubes show no blockages on the images, and the calyces fill normally and evenly. Later images confirm that both kidneys are normal in size and shape. The calyces and tubes are in the correct position and have no signs of blockage or holes. After urination, the images show the kidney tubes and bladder empty normally.  \n\n**Result:** The test is normal."
