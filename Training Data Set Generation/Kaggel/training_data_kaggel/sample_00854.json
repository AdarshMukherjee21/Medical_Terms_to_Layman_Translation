  "layman": "**Admission Diagnosis:** Left hip fracture.  \n**Chief Complaint:** Reduced ability to move, caused by the fracture.  \n\n**History:**  \nA friendly 70‑year‑old man fell from a low height at home on May 5, 2003. He was taken to ABCD Medical Center, where Dr. X examined him and sent him to the orthopedic ward. X‑rays showed a left hip fracture. He was in pain and could not walk.  \n\nDuring his stay, doctors reviewed his past illnesses, which include pneumonia that has since cleared, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, low thyroid hormone, depression, anxiety, seizures, chronic kidney disease, and anemia. All of these conditions are being managed well.  \n\nOn May 6, 2003 he had surgery to fix the left femoral neck and replace part of the hip joint (hemiarthroplasty). After surgery he experienced breathing problems, low blood counts, pneumonia, and high blood pressure. Cardiology has monitored him closely, and he has responded well to treatment, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. He is slowly getting better at daily activities and can tolerate longer therapy sessions.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Heart failure  \n- Chronic kidney disease, high blood nitrogen (azotemia), high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)  \n- Coronary artery disease, occasional irregular heart rhythm (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation)  \n- Past brain bleed (subdural hematoma) – this stops him from taking Coumadin (warfarin)  \n- Depression, panic attacks treated with Doxepin  \n- Low blood counts around surgery  \n- Trouble swallowing  \n\n**Allergies:**  \nZyloprim, penicillin, Vioxx, other NSAIDs.  \n\n**Current Medications:**  \n1. Heparin  \n2. Albuterol inhaler  \n3. Combivent (bronchodilator)  \n4. Aldactone (diuretic)  \n5. Doxepin (antidepressant)  \n6. Xanax (anxiety)  \n7. Aspirin  \n8. Amiodarone (heart rhythm)  \n9. Tegretol (seizure)  \n10. Synthroid (thyroid)  \n11. Colace (laxative)  \n\n**Social History:**  \nLives in a single‑story house with one step down. His wife is with him. Speech and language therapy is ongoing because of swallowing problems. He needs minimal help with daily tasks and moving in bed.  \n\n**Review of Systems:**  \nNo headaches, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  \n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **HEENT:** Mouth and throat clear.  \n- **Heart:** Regular rhythm, no extra sounds.  \n- **Lungs:** Clear on both sides.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, not tender, normal bowel sounds.  \n- **Extremities:** No swelling, no blue discoloration, no clubbing.  \n- **Neurologic:** No weakness or numbness in legs; muscle tone normal.  \n- **Wound:** Healing well, staples removed.  \n\n**Impression (Key Findings):**  \n1. Left hip fracture repaired with hemiarthroplasty.  \n2. History of panic attacks, anxiety, depression.  \n3. Heart attack with stent.  \n4. High blood pressure.  \n5. Low thyroid hormone.  \n6. Past brain bleed.  \n7. Seizures.  \n8. COPD, recent breathing problems.  \n9. Kidney disease.  \n10. Recent pneumonia.  \n11. Requires oxygen.  \n12. Low blood counts after surgery.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nTransfer to a rehabilitation facility as soon as medically cleared."
