  "medical": "ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: Solitary left kidney with obstruction, and hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Solitary left kidney with obstruction and hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency, plus a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection. PROCEDURES: Cystoscopy under anesthesia, ureteroscopy, an attempted tube placement, stent removal with retrograde pyelography, percutaneous tube placement, and nephrostomy by Radiology. PERTINENT LABORATORIES: Creatinine of 1.4. During the hospitalization it was decreased to 0.8 and Pseudomonas urinary tract infection, positive culture sensitive to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 3-1/2-year-old boy with a solitary kidney, had a ureteropelvic junction repair performed by Dr. Y, in the past, unfortunately, it was thought still be obstructed. A stent was placed approximately 6 weeks ago after urethroscopic placement with some difficulty. Plan was to remove the stent. At the time of removal, we were unable to place another tube within the collecting system, and the patient was admitted for percutaneous nephrostomy placement. He has had no recent cold or flu. He has problems with hypertension for which he is on enalapril at home in addition to his Macrodantin prophylaxis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. Multiple urinary tract infection, solitary kidney, and previous surgeries as mentioned above. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 14-organ system review of systems is negative except for the history of present illness. He also has history of being a 34-week preemie twin. ALLERGIES: No known allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable without any bleeding or anesthetic problems. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives at home with his parents, 2 brothers, and a sister. IMMUNIZATIONS: Up-to-date. MEDICATIONS: On admission was Macrodantin, hydralazine, and enalapril. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is an active little boy. HEENT: The head and neck exam was grossly normal. He had no oral, ocular, or nasal discharge. LUNGS: Exam was normal without wheezing. HEART: Without murmur or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft, without mass or tenderness with a well-healed flank incision. GU: Uncircumcised male with bilaterally descended testes. EXTREMITIES: He has full range of motion in all 4 extremities. SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry. NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact. BACK: He has normal back. Normal gait. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital after inability to place a ureteral stent via ureteroscopy and cystoscopy. He was made NPO. He had a fever at first time with elevated creatinine. He was also evaluated and treated by Dr. X, for fluid management, hypertensive management, and gave him some hydralazine and Lasix to improve his urine output, in addition to manage his blood pressure. Once the percutaneous tube was placed, we found that his urine culture grew Pseudomonas, so he was kept on Fortaz, and was switched over to ciprofloxacin without difficulty. He, otherwise, did well with continuing decrease his creatinine at the time of discharge to home. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with ciprofloxacin, enalapril, and recommendation for followup in Urology in 1 to 2 weeks for the surgical correction in 2 to 3 weeks of repeat pyeloplasty or possible ureterocalicostomy. The patient had draining nephrostomy tube without difficulty.",
  "layman": "**Admitting diagnoses:**  \nThe boy has only one left kidney that is blocked, high blood pressure, and a long‑term kidney problem.\n\n**Discharge diagnoses:**  \nSame as above, plus a urinary tract infection caused by Pseudomonas bacteria.\n\n**Procedures done:**  \n- Cystoscopy (looking inside the bladder) under anesthesia  \n- Ureteroscopy (looking inside the tube that carries urine from the kidney)  \n- Tried to put a tube in the kidney but couldn’t  \n- Removed a stent and did a back‑up X‑ray of the kidney (retrograde pyelography)  \n- Placed a tube through the skin into the kidney (percutaneous tube)  \n- Radiology put in a nephrostomy tube (a tube that drains urine from the kidney)\n\n**Key lab results:**  \n- Creatinine (kidney function test) was 1.4 before admission, dropped to 0.8 while in the hospital.  \n- Urine culture grew Pseudomonas that responds to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nThe 3½‑year‑old boy has one kidney. He had surgery in the past to fix a blockage at the junction where the kidney meets the tube (ureteropelvic junction). About six weeks ago, a stent was placed but it was hard to do. The plan was to remove the stent, but when they tried, they couldn’t put another tube in the kidney. He was admitted so a nephrostomy tube could be placed. He has never had a cold or flu recently. He has high blood pressure and takes enalapril at home, plus Macrodantin to prevent infections.\n\n**Past medical history:**  \nNo known allergies. He has had several urinary tract infections, one kidney, and the surgeries mentioned above.\n\n**Review of systems:**  \nAll 14 body systems checked were normal except for the problems already described. He was born at 34 weeks as a twin.\n\n**Allergies:**  \nNone.\n\n**Family history:**  \nNo family problems with bleeding or anesthesia.\n\n**Social history:**  \nLives at home with parents, two brothers, and a sister.\n\n**Immunizations:**  \nAll up to date.\n\n**Medications on admission:**  \nMacrodantin, hydralazine, and enalapril.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Active boy.  \n- Head and neck normal, no mouth, eye, or nose discharge.  \n- Lungs clear, no wheezing.  \n- Heart normal, no murmurs.  \n- Abdomen soft, no pain, incision healed.  \n- Genitals normal (uncircumcised, testes descended).  \n- Arms and legs move freely.  \n- Skin warm, pink, dry.  \n- Nerves normal.  \n- Back normal, walks normally.\n\n**Hospital course:**  \nHe was admitted because a stent couldn’t be placed. He was not allowed to eat or drink (NPO). He had a fever and high creatinine at first. Dr. X managed fluids and blood pressure, giving hydralazine and Lasix to help him urinate and lower blood pressure. After the percutaneous tube was placed, the urine culture showed Pseudomonas, so he was started on Fortaz and later switched to ciprofloxacin, which worked well. His creatinine continued to improve. He was discharged home in stable condition with ciprofloxacin, enalapril, and a plan to see a urologist in 1–2 weeks for surgery (repeat pyeloplasty or possibly a ureterocalicostomy) in 2–3 weeks. The nephrostomy tube was draining well."
