  "medical": "TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal endoscopy. PREMEDICATION: Fentanyl 125 mcg IV, Versed 8 mg IV. INDICATIONS: This healthy 28-year-old woman has had biliary colic-type symptoms for the past 3-1/2 weeks, characterized by severe pain, and brought on by eating greasy foods. She has had similar episodes couple of years ago and was told, at one point, that she had gallstones, but after her pregnancy, a repeat ultrasound was done, and apparently was normal, and nothing was done at that time. She was evaluated in the emergency department recently, when she developed this recurrent pain, and laboratory studies were unrevealing. Ultrasound was normal and a HIDA scan was done, which showed a low normal ejection fraction of 40%, and moderate reproduction of her pain. Endoscopy was requested to make sure there is not upper GI source of her pain before considering cholecystectomy. PROCEDURE: The patient was premedicated and the Olympus GIF 160 video endoscope advanced to the distal duodenum. Gastric biopsies were taken to rule out Helicobacter and the procedure was completed without complication. IMPRESSION: Normal endoscopy. PLAN: Refer to a general surgeon for consideration of cholecystectomy.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** An upper‑GI endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) with a small tissue sample taken.\n\n**Before the procedure:** The patient had abdominal pain.  \n**After the procedure:** The endoscopy looked normal.\n\n**Medication before the procedure:**  \n- Fentanyl 125 mcg IV  \n- Versed 8 mg IV\n\n**Why the procedure was done:**  \nA healthy 28‑year‑old woman has had severe, gallbladder‑type pain for the last 3½ weeks. The pain starts after eating greasy foods. She had similar pain a few years ago and was once told she had gallstones, but a repeat ultrasound after her pregnancy was normal and nothing was done. She went to the emergency department recently because the pain returned; blood tests were normal, an ultrasound was normal, and a HIDA scan showed a slightly low ejection fraction (40%) and reproduced her pain. The doctors wanted to rule out an upper‑GI cause before deciding on gallbladder removal.\n\n**What happened during the procedure:**  \nThe patient was given the pre‑medication. An Olympus GIF 160 video endoscope was inserted through the mouth, passed the esophagus, stomach, and into the lower part of the duodenum. A few gastric tissue samples were taken to check for Helicobacter infection. The procedure finished without any problems.\n\n**Result:** The endoscopy was normal.\n\n**Next step:** The patient will be referred to a general surgeon to discuss possible gallbladder removal."
