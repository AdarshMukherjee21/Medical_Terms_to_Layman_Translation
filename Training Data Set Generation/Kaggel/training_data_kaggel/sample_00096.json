  "medical": "TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained through the cervical spine without contrast. Additional high resolution coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were also obtained for better visualization of the osseous structures. FINDINGS: The cervical spine demonstrates normal alignment and mineralization with no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis. The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained. The central canal is patent. The pedicles and posterior elements are intact. The paravertebral soft tissues are within normal limits. The atlanto-dens interval and the dens are intact. The visualized lung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute abnormalities.",
  "layman": "**Technique:** We took a series of CT scans of the neck spine without using contrast dye. We also made extra high‑resolution images in side‑on and front‑to‑back views to see the bones better.\n\n**Findings:** The neck spine is straight and the bone density looks normal. There is no break, slip, or misalignment. The height of each vertebra and the spaces between them are fine. The main spinal canal is open. The small bones that support the spine are intact. The surrounding soft tissues look normal. The joint between the top of the spine and the skull, and the dens bone, are fine. The upper parts of the lungs that we could see are clear.\n\n**Impression:** No urgent problems were found."
