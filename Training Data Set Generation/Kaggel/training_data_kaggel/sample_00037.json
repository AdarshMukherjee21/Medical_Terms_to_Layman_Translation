  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: Vegetation and bacteremia. PROCEDURE: Transesophageal echocardiogram. INTERPRETATION: The procedure and its complications were explained to the patient in detail and formal consent was obtained. The patient was brought to special procedure unit. His throat was anesthetized with lidocaine spray. Subsequently, 2 mg of IV Versed was given for sedation. The patient was positioned. Probe was introduced without any difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure very well. Probe was taken out. No complications were noted. Findings are as mentioned below. FINDINGS: 1. Left ventricle has normal size and dimensions with normal function. Ejection fraction of 60%. 2. Left atrium and right-sided chambers were of normal size and dimensions. 3. Left atrial appendage is clean without any clot or smoke effect. 4. Atrial septum is intact. Bubble study was negative. 5. Mitral valve is structurally normal. 6. Aortic valve reveals echodensity suggestive of vegetation. 7. Tricuspid valve was structurally normal. 8. Doppler reveals moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation. 9. Aorta is benign. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal left ventricular size and function. 2. Echodensity involving the aortic valve suggestive of endocarditis and vegetation. 3. Doppler study as above most pronounced being moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam:**  \nThe doctor was checking for a growth (vegetation) on a heart valve and for bacteria in the blood.\n\n**Procedure:**  \nA transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done.  \nThe doctor explained the test and any possible problems. The patient gave written permission.  \nThe patient was taken to a special procedure room. A lidocaine spray numbed his throat.  \nHe was given 2 mg of IV Versed to help him relax.  \nThe patient was positioned and the probe was inserted easily.  \nHe tolerated the test well and no problems happened.  \nThe results are listed below.\n\n**Findings**\n\n1. The left ventricle is the normal size and works normally. It pumps out 60 % of the blood it receives.  \n2. The left atrium and the right‑sided chambers are the normal size.  \n3. The left atrial appendage is clear – no clots or abnormal echoes.  \n4. The wall between the two atria (septum) is intact. A bubble test was negative.  \n5. The mitral valve looks normal.  \n6. The aortic valve shows an echo‑dense spot that looks like a vegetation.  \n7. The tricuspid valve looks normal.  \n8. Blood flow studies show moderate leaking of the mitral valve and moderate‑to‑severe leaking of the aortic valve.  \n9. The aorta itself is normal.\n\n**Impression**\n\n1. The left ventricle is normal in size and function.  \n2. The echo‑dense spot on the aortic valve suggests endocarditis with a vegetation.  \n3. The most significant finding is the moderate‑to‑severe aortic valve leaking."
