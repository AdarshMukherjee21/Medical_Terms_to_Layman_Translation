  "medical": "BILATERAL SCROTAL ORCHECTOMY PROCEDURE:: The patient is placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the scrotum was approached and through a transverse mid scrotal incision, the right testicle was delivered through the incision. Hemostasis was obtained with the Bovie and the spermatic cord was identified. It was clamped, suture ligated with 0 chromic catgut and the cord above was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine for postoperative pain relief. The left testicle was delivered through the same incision. The spermatic cord was identified, clamped, suture ligated and that cord was also injected with 0.25% percent Marcaine. The incision was injected with the same material and then closed in two layers using 4-0 chromic catgut continuous for the dartos and interrupted for the skin. A dry sterile dressing fluff and scrotal support applied over that. The patient was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "BILATERAL SCROTAL ORCHECTOMY PROCEDURE\n\nThe patient lay on their back and was prepared and covered in the usual way. After the patient was fully asleep with general anesthesia, the surgeon opened the scrotum with a horizontal cut in the middle. The right testicle was pulled out through the cut. The surgeon stopped any bleeding with a cautery device, found the spermatic cord, clamped it, tied it with a 0‑chromic catgut suture, and injected 0.25% Marcaine into the cord to help with pain after the surgery. The left testicle was then pulled out through the same cut. Its cord was also clamped, tied, and injected with 0.25% Marcaine. The incision itself was also given the same injection. The wound was closed in two layers: the dartos muscle was closed with a continuous 4‑0 chromic catgut stitch, and the skin was closed with interrupted stitches. A dry sterile dressing and scrotal support were placed over the area. The patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
