  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tremor, dystonic form. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tremor, dystonic form. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. ANESTHESIA: MAC (monitored anesthesia care) with local anesthesia. TITLE OF PROCEDURES: 1. Left frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode. 2. Right frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode. 3. Microelectrode recording of deep brain structures. 4. Stereotactic volumetric CT scan of head for target coordinate determination. 5. Intraoperative programming and assessment of device. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of dystonic tremor. The movements have been refractory to aggressive medical measures, felt to be candidate for deep brain stimulation. The procedure is discussed below. I have discussed with the patient in great deal the risks, benefits, and alternatives. She fully accepted and consented to the procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition. She was placed on the operating table in seated position. Her head was shaved. Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes. IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation. She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken. The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen. Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint. Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates. The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again. Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit. At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes. Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field. This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture. A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings. Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture. Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field. Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill. The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade. The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well. The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame. Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc. Microelectrode recording was then performed. The signatures of the cells were recognized. Microelectrode unit was removed. Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted. The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed. Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side. This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system. Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system. The microelectrode unit was then remounted. Microelectrode recording was then undertaken. After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed. Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory. The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box. Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side. This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system. The arc was then removed. A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel. We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally. Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used. Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only. Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples. Sterile dressings were applied. The Leksell arc was then removed. She was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition. All needle, sponge, cottonoid, and blade counts were correct x2 as verified by the nurses.",

Left frontal skull opening to put a deep‑brain stimulator electrode.  \n2. Right frontal skull opening to put a deep‑brain stimulator electrode.  \n3. Recording of brain cells with a micro‑electrode.  \n4. 3‑D CT scan of the head to find the exact spot for the electrodes.  \n5. Programming and checking the device while the patient is still in the operating room.\n\n**Indications:**  \nA 61‑year‑old woman has a tremor that looks like dystonia. The tremor has not improved with strong medication, so doctors thought deep‑brain stimulation might help. She was told about the risks, benefits, and other options and she agreed to the surgery.\n\n**Procedure details (simplified):**  \nThe patient was taken to the waiting area and then to the operating room while she was stable. She sat on the operating table. Her head was shaved and the scalp was cleaned with Betadine. A special frame (Leksell frame) was attached to her head after numbing the pin sites with a mix of Marcaine and lidocaine. She received antibiotics and sedation.\n\nShe was moved to the CT scanner for a 3‑D scan of her head. The images were sent to the surgical computer where a 3‑D model was made and the exact coordinates for the electrodes were chosen. These coordinates were 20 mm left, 3 mm forward, and 4 mm down from a brain landmark called the AC‑PC line. The coordinates were then sent back to the operating room.\n\nThe patient sat on the table again. A urinary catheter was inserted and she was secured with a Mayfield head clamp. The right and left forehead and the top of the skull were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized with Betadine for 10 minutes. Sterile drapes were placed around the area. The same local anesthetic was used on the scalp.\n\nIncisions were made on both sides of the forehead and a curved incision over the top of the skull. Small holes were drilled just behind the coronal suture on each side. Bleeding was stopped with bipolar cautery and a Bovie. Retractors were put in place.\n\nUsing a drill, two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5‑mm cutting bur. The holes were cleared, the dura (brain covering) was cauterized and cut in a cross shape on both sides with a #11 blade. The brain surface was nicked with the same blade.\n\nThe Leksell arc was set to the right‑side coordinates and fixed to the frame. A micro‑electrode was attached to the arc and used to record brain cells. The cell patterns were identified and the micro‑electrode was removed. A holding unit for the deep‑brain stimulator electrode was attached. The electrode was placed into the target spot and tested while the patient was still awake. Using a standard program, the patient felt some relief on her left side. The electrode was fixed in place with a ring and cap.\n\nThe same steps were repeated on the left side: the arc was set to the left coordinates, the micro‑electrode was used again, the electrode was placed, tested, and secured. After both electrodes were in place, the arc was removed.\n\nA tunnel was made under the scalp between the two incisions so the ends of the electrodes could pass through. The electrodes were then closed and the tunnel was sealed. The area was irrigated with Betadine. Bleeding was stopped with bipolar cautery. The fascia was closed with 3‑0 Vicryl stitches in a simple pattern, and the skin was closed with staples. Sterile dressings were applied. The Leksell frame was taken off.\n\nThe patient was turned onto her back and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. All surgical items were counted twice and verified by the nurses."
