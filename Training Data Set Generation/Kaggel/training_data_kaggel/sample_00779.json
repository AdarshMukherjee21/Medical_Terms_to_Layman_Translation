  "medical": "Doctor's Name Doctor's Address Dear Doctor: This letter serves as an introduction to my patient, A, who will be seeing you in the near future. He is a pleasant young man who has a diagnosis of bulbar cerebral palsy and hypotonia. He has been treated by Dr. X through the pediatric neurology clinic. He saw Dr. X recently and she noted that he was having difficulty with mouth breathing, which was contributing to some of his speech problems. She also noted and confirmed that he has significant tonsillar hypertrophy. The concern we have is whether he may benefit from surgery to remove his tonsils and improve his mouth breathing and his swallowing and speech. Therefore, I ask for your opinion on this matter. For his chronic allergic rhinitis symptoms, he is currently on Flonase two sprays to each nostril once a day. He also has been taking Zyrtec 10 mg a day with only partial relief of the symptoms. He does have an allergy to penicillin. I appreciate your input on his care. If you have any questions regarding, please feel free to call me through my office. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation.",

He is a friendly young man who has bulbar cerebral palsy and low muscle tone (hypotonia). He has been treated by Dr. X at the pediatric neurology clinic. Dr. X recently noted that he has trouble breathing through his mouth, which is affecting his speech. She also confirmed that he has enlarged tonsils. We are wondering if removing his tonsils might help his breathing, swallowing, and speech.\n\nFor his long‑standing allergic rhinitis, he uses Flonase (two sprays in each nostril once a day) and takes Zyrtec 10 mg daily, but these only give partial relief. He is allergic to penicillin.\n\nI would appreciate your opinion on his care. If you have any questions, please call my office. I look forward to hearing from you about his evaluation.\n\nThank you."
