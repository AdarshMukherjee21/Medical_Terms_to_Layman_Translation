ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: A 79-year-old woman with recurrent bladder tumors of the bladder neck. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in lithotomy position under satisfactory general anesthesia. A #21-French cystourethroscope was inserted into the bladder. Examination of the bladder showed approximately a 3-cm area of erythema and recurrent papillomatosis just above and lateral to the left ureteral orifice. No other lesions were noted. Using a cold punch biopsy forceps, a random biopsy was obtained. The entire area was electrofulgurated using the Bugbee electrode. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in satisfactory condition.",
