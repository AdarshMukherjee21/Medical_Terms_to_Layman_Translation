  "layman": "2‑D M‑MODE: 1. The left atrium is enlarged, measuring 4.7 cm across. 2. Both the right and left ventricles are normal size. 3. The left ventricle pumps normally, with an ejection fraction of 51 %. 4. The left ventricle relaxes normally. 5. There is no fluid around the heart. 6. All four heart valves (aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonary) look normal. 7. The pressure in the pulmonary artery is 36 mmHg.  \n\nDOPPLER: 1. Mild leaking of the mitral and tricuspid valves. 2. Very small leaking of the aortic and pulmonary valves."
