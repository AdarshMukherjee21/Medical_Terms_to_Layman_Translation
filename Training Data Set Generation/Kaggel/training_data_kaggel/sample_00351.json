  "medical": "INDICATION: Aortic stenosis. PROCEDURE: Transesophageal echocardiogram. INTERPRETATION: Procedure and complications explained to the patient in detail. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was anesthetized in the throat with lidocaine spray. Subsequently, 3 mg of IV Versed was given for sedation. The patient was positioned and transesophageal probe was introduced without any difficulty. Images were taken. The patient tolerated the procedure very well without any complications. Findings as mentioned below. FINDINGS: 1. Left ventricle is in normal size and dimension. Normal function. Ejection fraction of 60%. 2. Left atrium and right-sided chambers are of normal size and dimension. 3. Mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic valves are structurally normal. 4. Aortic valve reveals annular calcification with fibrocalcific valve leaflets with decreased excursion. 5. Left atrial appendage is clean without any clot or smoke effect. 6. Atrial septum intact. Study was negative. 7. Doppler study essentially benign. 8. Aorta essentially benign. 9. Aortic valve planimetry valve area average about 1.3 cm2 consistent with moderate aortic stenosis. SUMMARY: 1. Normal left ventricular size and function. 2. Benign Doppler flow pattern. 3. Aortic valve area of 1.3 cm2 planimetry.",
  "layman": "INDICATION: Aortic stenosis.  \nPROCEDURE: Transesophageal echocardiogram.  \n\nINTERPRETATION: The doctor explained the procedure and possible complications to the patient in detail. The patient gave informed consent. The throat was numbed with a lidocaine spray, and 3 mg of IV Versed was given to help the patient relax. The patient was positioned and the transesophageal probe was inserted easily. Images were taken. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no complications. Findings are listed below.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n1. The left ventricle is the normal size and works normally, with an ejection fraction of 60%.  \n2. The left atrium and the right‑sided chambers are the normal size.  \n3. The mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic valves look normal.  \n4. The aortic valve shows calcium buildup and stiff leaflets that move less than normal.  \n5. The left atrial appendage is clear, with no blood clots or abnormal echoes.  \n6. The atrial septum is intact. The study shows no problems.  \n7. The Doppler flow study is essentially normal.  \n8. The aorta looks normal.  \n9. The aortic valve area measured by planimetry is about 1.3 cm², which is consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.  \n\nSUMMARY:  \n1. Normal left ventricular size and function.  \n2. Normal Doppler flow pattern.  \n3. Aortic valve area of 1.3 cm² by planimetry."
