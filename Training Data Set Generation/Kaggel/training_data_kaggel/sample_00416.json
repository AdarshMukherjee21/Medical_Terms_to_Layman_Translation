  "medical": "CC: Lethargy. HX: This 28y/o RHM was admitted to a local hospital on 7/14/95 for marked lethargy. He had been complaining of intermittent headaches and was noted to have subtle changes in personality for two weeks prior to 7/14/95. On the morning of 7/14/95, his partner found him markedly lethargic and complaingin of abdominal pain and vomiting. He denied fevers, chills, sweats, cough, CP, SOB or diarrhea. Upon evaluation locally, he had a temperature of 99.5F and appeared lethargic. He also had anisocoria with left pupil 0.5mm bigger than the right. There was also question of left facial weakness. An MRI was obtained and revealed a large left hemispheric mass lesion with surrounding edema and mass effect. He was given 10mg of IV Decardron,100gm of IV Mannitol, intubated and hyperventilated and transferred to UIHC. He was admitted to the Department of Medicine on 7/14/95, and transferred to the Department of Neurology on 7/17/95, after being extubated. MEDS ON ADMISSION: Bactrim DS qd, Diflucan 100mg qd, Acyclovir 400mg bid, Xanax, Stavudine 40mg bid, Rifabutin 300mg qd. PMH: 1) surgical correction of pyoloric stenosis, age 1, 2)appendectomy, 3) HIV/AIDS dx 1991. He was initially treated with AZT, then DDI. He developed chronic diarrhea and was switched to D4T in 1/95. However, he developed severe neuropathy and this was stopped 4/95. The diarrhea recured. He has Acyclovir resistant genital herpes and generalized psoriasis. He most recent CD4 count (within 1 month of admission) was 20. FHX: HTN and multiple malignancies of unknown type. SHX: Homosexual, in monogamous relationship with an HIV infected partner for the past 3 years. EXAM: 7/14/95 (by Internal Medicine): BP134/80, HR118, RR16 on vent, 38.2C, Intubated. MS: Somnolent, but opened eyes to loud voices and would follow most commands. CN: Pupils 2.5/3.0 and &quot;equally reactive to light.&quot; Mild horizontal nystagmus on rightward gaze. EOM were otherwise intact. MOTOR: Moved 4 extremities well. Sensory/Coord/Gait/Station/Reflexes: not done. Gen EXAM: Penil ulcerations. EXAM: 7/17/96 (by Neurology): BP144/73, HR59, RR20, 36.0, extubated. MS: Alert and mildly lethargic. Oriented to name only. Thought he was a local hospital and that it was 1/17/1994. Did not understand he had a brain lesion. CN: Pupils 6/5.5 decreasing to 4/4 on exposure to light. EOM were full and smooth. No RAPD or light-near dissociation. papilledema (OU). Right lower facial weakness and intact facial sensation to PP testing. Gag-shrug and corneal responses were intact, bilaterally. Tongue midline. MOTOR: Grade 5- strength on the right side. Sensory: no loss of sensation on PP/VIB/PROP testing. Coord: reduced speed and accuracy on right FNF and right HKS movements. Station: RUE pronator drift. Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2+/2 throughout. Babinski sign present on right and absent on left. Gen Exam: unremarkable except for the genital lesion noted by Internal medicine. COURSE: The outside MRI was reviewed and was notable for the left frontal/parietal mass lesion with surround edema. The mass inhomogenously enhanced with gadolinium contrast. The findings were consistent most with lymphoma, though toxoplasmosis could not be excluded. He refused brain biopsy and was started on empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis. This consisted of Pyrimethamine 75mg qd and Sulfadiazine 2 g bid. He later became DNR and was transferred at his and his partner's request Back to a local hospital. He never returned for follow-up.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Lethargy.  \n\n**History:** A 28‑year‑old man with HIV was admitted to a local hospital on July 14, 1995 because he was very sleepy. He had been having occasional headaches and his personality had changed a little for about two weeks before admission. On the morning of July 14, his partner found him very tired, with stomach pain and vomiting. He said he had no fever, chills, sweating, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, or diarrhea.  \n\nAt the local hospital he had a temperature of 99.5 °F and looked sleepy. His left pupil was 0.5 mm larger than the right and there was a possible weakness on the left side of his face. An MRI showed a large mass in the left side of his brain with swelling around it and pressure on the brain. He was given 10 mg of IV Decadron (a steroid) and 100 g of IV Mannitol (a fluid that reduces swelling), was intubated (a tube was put in his airway) and had his breathing increased to lower his carbon dioxide levels, then he was moved to the University of Illinois Hospital.  \n\nHe was admitted to the Medicine department on July 14 and moved to Neurology on July 17 after he was taken off the breathing tube.  \n\n**Medications on admission:**  \n- Bactrim DS once daily  \n- Diflucan 100 mg once daily  \n- Acyclovir 400 mg twice daily  \n- Xanax (for anxiety)  \n- Stavudine 40 mg twice daily  \n- Rifabutin 300 mg once daily  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Surgery for pyloric stenosis when he was 1 year old.  \n2. Appendectomy.  \n3. HIV/AIDS diagnosed in 1991. He was first treated with AZT, then DDI. He had chronic diarrhea and switched to D4T in January 1995. D4T was stopped in April 1995 because it caused severe nerve pain, and the diarrhea returned. He has genital herpes that does not respond to Acyclovir and generalized psoriasis. His most recent CD4 count (within a month of admission) was 20.  \n\n**Family history:** High blood pressure and several unknown cancers.  \n\n**Social history:** He is homosexual and has been in a monogamous relationship with an HIV‑positive partner for the past three years.  \n\n**Physical exam on July 14 (Medicine):**  \n- Blood pressure 134/80, heart rate 118, breathing 16/min on ventilator, temperature 38.2 °C, intubated.  \n- He was sleepy but opened his eyes to loud voices and could follow most commands.  \n- Both pupils were 2.5 mm and 3.0 mm and reacted to light. He had mild horizontal eye movement problems when looking to the right. Eye movements were otherwise normal.  \n- He could move all four limbs well. Sensation, coordination, gait, balance, and reflexes were not tested.  \n- Genital exam showed penile ulcers.  \n\n**Physical exam on July 17 (Neurology):**  \n- Blood pressure 144/73, heart rate 59, breathing 20/min, temperature 36.0 °C, no longer intubated.  \n- He was alert but still a little sleepy. He only knew his own name and thought he was at the local hospital on January 17, 1994. He did not understand he had a brain tumor.  \n- Pupils were 6 mm and 5.5 mm, shrinking to 4 mm when light was shone. Eye movements were full and smooth. No abnormal light reflex. Both eyes had swelling of the optic disc.  \n- Right lower face was weak but sensation was normal.  \n- Gag, shrug, and corneal reflexes were normal on both sides. Tongue was straight.  \n- Right side strength was 5‑ (almost normal). Sensation to pain, vibration, and proprioception was normal.  \n- Coordination was slower and less accurate on the right side for finger‑to‑nose and heel‑to‑shin tests.  \n- Right upper arm drift when holding arms out. Gait was not tested. Reflexes were 2+ on both sides. Babinski sign (foot reflex) was present on the right and absent on the left.  \n- Genital exam was otherwise normal except for the ulcer noted earlier.  \n\n**Course:** The MRI from the outside hospital showed a left frontal/parietal brain mass with swelling. The mass had uneven enhancement with contrast. The findings most closely matched lymphoma, but toxoplasmosis (a parasitic infection) could not be ruled out. He refused a brain biopsy and was started on empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis: Pyrimethamine 75 mg once daily and Sulfadiazine 2 g twice daily. He later became DNR (do‑not‑resuscitate) and, at his and his partner’s request, was sent back to the local hospital. He never returned for follow‑up."
