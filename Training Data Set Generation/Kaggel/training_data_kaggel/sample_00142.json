  "medical": "EXAM: CT KUB. REASON FOR EXAM: Flank pain. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis per renal stone protocol. Correlation is made with the prior examination dated 01/16/09. FINDINGS: There is no intrarenal stone or obstruction bilaterally. There is no hydronephrosis, ureteral dilatation. There are calcifications about the pelvis including one in the left upper pelvis, but these are stable from the prior study and there is no upstream ureteral dilatation, the findings therefore are favored to represent phleboliths. The bladder is nearly completely decompressed. There is no asymmetric renal enlargement or perinephric stranding as secondary evidence of obstruction. The appendix is normal. There is no evidence for a pericolonic inflammatory process or small bowel obstruction. Dedicated scan to the pelvis disclosed the aforementioned presumed phleboliths. There is no pelvic free fluid or adenopathy. Lung bases appear clear. Given the lack of contrast, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas appear grossly unremarkable. The gallbladder has been resected. There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy. IMPRESSION: 1. No renal stone or evidence of obstruction. Stable appearing pelvic calcifications likely indicate phleboliths. 2. Normal appendix.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB).  \n**Reason for exam:** Flank pain.  \n**Technique:** A non‑contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done using a kidney‑stone protocol. The results were compared with a previous scan from 01/16/09.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- No kidney stones or blockages were found in either kidney.  \n- The kidneys and ureters are not swollen (no hydronephrosis or dilation).  \n- Small calcium deposits were seen in the pelvis, including one in the left upper pelvis. These are the same as in the earlier scan and are not causing any swelling of the ureters, so they are most likely harmless blood‑clot stones (phleboliths).  \n- The bladder is almost empty.  \n- The kidneys are the same size on both sides and there is no swelling around them.  \n- The appendix looks normal.  \n- There is no sign of inflammation near the colon or any blockage in the small intestine.  \n- The pelvis shows the same calcium deposits mentioned above. No fluid or swollen lymph nodes are present there.  \n- The lower lungs look clear.  \n- Because no contrast was used, the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas appear normal.  \n- The gallbladder has been removed.  \n- No free fluid or abnormal lymph nodes are seen in the abdomen.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. No kidney stones or blockages. The stable calcium deposits in the pelvis are likely harmless blood‑clot stones.  \n2. The appendix is normal."
