Chondromalacia of the patella, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopic lateral meniscoplasty. 2. Patellar shaving of the right knee. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: Zero. GROSS FINDINGS: A complex tear involving the lateral and posterior horns of the lateral meniscus and grade-II chondromalacia of the patella. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male presented to the office complaining of right knee pain. He complained of pain on the medial aspect of his right knee after an injury at work, which he twisted his right knee. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the operative surgeon, the patient, the Department of Anesthesia and the nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #2, placed on the operating table in supine position. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The right lower extremity was then properly positioned in a Johnson knee holder. At this time, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 20 cc was administered to the right knee intra-articularly under sterile conditions. The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon. The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint. An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch. Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella. There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter. Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted. While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal. This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line. A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed. Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear. The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia. Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign. PCL was also noted to be intact. Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns. It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle. An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus. It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee. Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection. The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured. The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact. Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella. This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver. It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well. The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed. 20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly. Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity. At this time, Department of Anesthesia reversed the anesthetic. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications.",

Softening of the cartilage under the kneecap (chondromalacia) in the right knee.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. Torn lateral meniscus in the right knee.  \n2. Chondromalacia of the kneecap in the right knee.  \n\n**Procedure performed**  \n1. Arthroscopic repair of the torn lateral meniscus.  \n2. Shaving of the kneecap cartilage in the right knee.  \n\n**Anesthesia**  \nGeneral anesthesia.  \n\n**Complications**  \nNone.  \n\n**Estimated blood loss**  \nMinimal.  \n\n**Tourniquet time**  \nNone.  \n\n**Gross findings**  \nA complex tear of the lateral meniscus involving its outer and back parts, plus moderate (grade‑II) cartilage softening of the kneecap.  \n\n**History of present illness**  \nA 45‑year‑old white man came to the office with pain in his right knee. He felt pain on the inside of the knee after twisting it at work.  \n\n**Procedure**  \nAfter explaining all possible risks, complications, and expected benefits, the patient gave written consent. The surgeon, the patient, the anesthesia team, and the nurses confirmed the leg to be operated on. The patient was moved to the operating room, laid on his back, and given general anesthesia. All bony points were padded. The right leg was placed in a special knee holder. A small amount of lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the knee joint. The leg was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nA small (1‑cm) incision was made just below the joint line on the outer side of the knee to create the first working portal. A camera and instruments were inserted through this portal to look at the knee joint, including the front (patellofemoral) area, the inner and outer gutters, and the notch between the thigh bone and shin bone. The front joint showed moderate cartilage wear, but no loose pieces were seen. The inner compartment had no cartilage wear or meniscus tear.  \n\nA second portal was made on the inner side of the knee using a needle to locate it, then a 1‑cm incision. A probe was used to examine the meniscus again, confirming no tear. The knee was moved through its full range of motion; no new problems appeared. The front and back ligaments were intact.  \n\nIn the outer compartment, a large “bucket‑handle” tear of the lateral meniscus was found. The torn piece was pulled back into place, but because it involved both the outer and inner parts of the meniscus, the surgeon decided to remove the torn portion. Arthroscopic scissors cut the torn piece, and a grasper removed it from the knee. The entire torn piece was removed. Photos were taken before and after the removal.  \n\nThe remaining meniscus was shaped with a shaver. The outer gutter was checked again and found to be clear. The inner surface of the kneecap was cleaned with a small shaver; it was smooth after the procedure. The knee was thoroughly washed and dried, and all instruments were taken out.  \n\nA small amount of local anesthetic (Marcaine) was injected into each portal and into the joint. A sterile dressing was applied, including a bandage, adhesive strips, and a wrap. The anesthesia team reversed the general anesthesia. The patient was moved to the recovery area. He tolerated the procedure well and had no complications."
