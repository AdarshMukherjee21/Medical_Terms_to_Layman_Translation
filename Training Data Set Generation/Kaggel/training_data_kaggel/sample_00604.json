  "medical": "INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY SIMULATION The patient will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy in order to deliver high-dose treatment to sensitive structures. The target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures. Initially, the preliminary isocenter is set on a fluoroscopically-based simulation unit. The patient is appropriately immobilized using a customized immobilization device. Preliminary simulation films are obtained and approved by me. The patient is marked and transferred to the CT scanner. Sequential images are obtained and transferred electronically to the treatment planning software. Extensive analysis then occurs. The target volume, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected. In addition organs at risk are outlined. Appropriate doses are selected, both for the target, as well as constraints for organs at risk. Inverse treatment planning is performed by the physics staff under my supervision. These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician and completion of successful quality assurance.",
  "layman": "INTENSITY‑MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY SIMULATION\n\nThe patient will have intensity‑modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to give a high dose to the tumor while protecting nearby sensitive tissues. The area to be treated is close to important radiosensitive organs. First, we set the treatment center on a fluoroscopy‑based simulation machine. The patient is secured with a custom immobilization device. We take initial simulation X‑ray films and approve them. The patient is then marked and moved to the CT scanner. We take a series of CT images and send them electronically to the planning software. A detailed analysis follows. We define the target area, adding margins for uncertainty, possible patient movement, and hidden tumor spread. We also outline nearby organs at risk. We choose the dose for the target and set limits for the organs at risk. The physics team creates the treatment plan using inverse planning while I supervise. The plan is reviewed by the physician and is only used after the physician approves it and after a successful quality‑assurance check."
