  "medical": "In July 2003 the patient had an episode of lightheaded or near syncope. She was taken to Hospital and admitted for 24 hours. Workup was negative. Soon after that, she had another episode of weakness and was taken to Valley Presbyterian Hospital emergency room and admitted. She was diagnosed as having dehydration and was treated with intravenous fluids and then was discharged after about one day. Subsequently, the patient developed a moderately severe depression. She was tried on various medications, which caused sweating, nightmares and perhaps other side effects. She was finally put on Effexor 25 mg two tablets h.s. and trazodone 100 mg h.s., and has done fairly well, although she still has significant depression. Her daughter brought her in today to be sure that she does not have dementia. There is no history of memory loss. There is no history of focal neurologic symptoms or significant headaches. The patient's complaints, according to the daughter, include not wanted to go out in public, shamed regarding her appearance (25-pound weight loss over the past year), eating poorly, not doing things unless asked, hiding food to prevent having to eat it, nervousness, and not taking a shower. She has no focal neurologic deficits. She does complain of constipation. She has severe sleep maintenance insomnia and often sleeps only 2 hours before awakening frequently for the rest of the night. The patient was apparently visiting her daughter in northern California in December 2003. She was taken to her daughter's primary care physician. She underwent vitamin B12 level, RPR, T4 and TSH, all of which were normal. On 05/15/04, the patient underwent MRI scan of the brain. I reviewed the scan in the office today. This shows moderate cortical and central atrophy and also shows mild-to-moderate deep white matter ischemic changes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has generally been in reasonably good physical health. She did have a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; in 1975 after the death of her husband. She was hospitalized for several weeks and was treated with ECT. This occurred while she was living in Korea. She does not smoke or drink alcoholic beverages. She has had no prior surgeries. There is a past history of hypertension, but this is no longer present. FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for dementia. Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 62. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: Blood pressure 128/80, pulse 84, temperature 97.4 F, and weight 105 lbs (dressed). General: Well-developed, well-nourished Korean female in no acute distress. Head: Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits. Neck: Supple, with full range of motion. No spasm or tenderness. Carotid pulsations are of normal volume and contour bilaterally without bruits. No thyromegaly or adenopathy. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or deformity. Range of motion full throughout. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Mental Status: The patient is awake, alert and oriented to time, place, and person and generally appropriate. She exhibits mild psychomotor retardation and has a flat or depressed affect. She knows the current president of Korea and the current president of the United States. She can recall 3 out of 3 objects after 5 minutes. Calculations are performed fairly well with occasional errors. There is no right-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysnomia or aphasia. Cranial Nerves: II: Visual fields full to confrontation. Fundi benign. III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus. No ptosis. Pupils equal, round and react briskly to light and accommodation. V: Normal sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally. Corneal reflexes equal bilaterally. Motor function normal. VII: No facial asymmetry. VIII: Hears finger rub bilaterally. Weber and Rinne tests normal. IX & X: Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation. Gag reflex equal bilaterally. XI: Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally. XII: Tongue protrudes in the midline without atrophy or fasciculations. Rapid alternating movements normal. No dysarthria. Motor: Tone, bulk, and strength are normal throughout. No drift of outstretched upper extremities. No tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements. Reflexes (right/left): Biceps 2/2, triceps 1/1, brachioradialis 1/1, knee jerk 1/1 and ankle jerk 1/1. Plantar responses are flexor bilaterally. No snout, glabellar or palmomental reflex. Coordination: No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia in upper or lower extremities. Gait: Intact, including tandem gait and heel and toe walking. Station: Romberg normal. Sensation: Intact to pinprick, light touch, vibration and position sense throughout. Normal stereognosis, graphesthesia, and double simultaneous stimulation. DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: 1. Depression, partially treated. 2. Possible early dementia. CASE DISCUSSION: Thank you once again Dr. X for allowing me to participate in the care of this very nice lady. She clearly has residual depression despite the above-mentioned treatment protocol. In order to assess the possibility of an occult cognitive impairment, I recommended neuropsychological testing along with EEG and P-300 long latency auditory evoked response study. I would also like to obtain a DHEA and DHEA sulfate level, as decreased amounts of these hormones may result in cognitive dysfunction and depression. I have asked the patient to return for follow up after completion of the studies. She should be considered for a retrial of Remeron, as this generally helps to improve appetite and sleep in these elderly patients. The normal dosage for elderly small patients such as this is 15 mg h.s.",
  "layman": "In July 2003 the patient felt very light‑headed and almost fainted. She was taken to the hospital and stayed for 24 hours, but all tests were normal. A few days later she had another episode of weakness and was taken to Valley Presbyterian Hospital. She was found to be dehydrated, received IV fluids, and was discharged after about a day. After that she developed a moderate‑to‑severe depression. She tried several medicines that caused sweating, nightmares, and other side effects. She was finally put on Effexor 25 mg twice at bedtime and trazodone 100 mg at bedtime. She is doing somewhat better, but still has a lot of depression.\n\nHer daughter brought her in today to make sure she does not have dementia. The patient has no history of memory loss, focal neurological symptoms, or serious headaches. According to her daughter, the patient does not want to go out in public, feels ashamed of her appearance (she has lost 25 lb in the past year), eats poorly, only does things when asked, hides food so she does not have to eat it, feels nervous, and does not shower. She has no focal neurological deficits but complains of constipation. She has severe trouble staying asleep; she usually sleeps only two hours and then wakes up many times during the night.\n\nIn December 2003 she visited her daughter in northern California and was seen by the daughter’s primary‑care doctor. Blood tests for vitamin B12, syphilis (RPR), thyroid (T4, TSH) were all normal. On May 15 2004 she had an MRI of the brain. The scan showed moderate shrinkage of the outer brain and central areas and mild‑to‑moderate changes in the deep white‑matter that look like old small strokes.\n\nPast medical history: She has generally been in good physical health. In 1975 she had a “nervous breakdown” after her husband died; she was hospitalized for several weeks and treated with electro‑convulsive therapy while living in Korea. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and has had no surgeries. She had high blood pressure in the past, but it is now controlled.\n\nFamily history: No family history of dementia. Her mother died of a stroke at age 62.\n\nPhysical exam: Blood pressure 128/80 mm Hg, pulse 84 bpm, temperature 97.4 °F, weight 105 lb. She looks well‑developed and well‑nourished, and she is not in any acute distress. Head and neck are normal. No swelling of the thyroid. Limbs are normal with full range of motion.\n\nNeurological exam: She is awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person. She moves slowly and has a flat, depressed mood. She knows the current presidents of Korea and the United States. She can remember three objects after five minutes and does basic math with occasional mistakes. She has no confusion, trouble naming, or speech problems. All cranial nerves are normal. Motor strength, tone, and reflexes are normal. She can walk normally and has normal sensation.\n\nDiagnostic impression: 1. Depression, partially treated. 2. Possible early dementia.\n\nCase discussion: The patient still has significant depression despite treatment. To evaluate possible hidden cognitive problems, neuropsychological testing, an EEG, and a P‑300 auditory test are recommended. Blood levels of DHEA and DHEA‑sulfate should also be checked because low levels can affect mood and cognition. She should return after these studies. A trial of Remeron (15 mg at bedtime) may help her appetite and sleep."
