Intraoperative cholangiogram. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general endotracheal anesthetic. The patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef intravenously piggyback. The abdomen was prepared and draped in routine sterile fashion. A 1-cm incision was made at the umbilicus and a Veress needle was inserted. Saline test was performed. Satisfactory pneumoperitoneum was achieved by insufflation of CO2 to a pressure of 14 mmHg. The Veress needle was removed. A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted. Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a gallbladder that was soft and without adhesions to it. It was largely mobile. The liver had a normal appearance as did the peritoneal cavity. A 5-mm cannula was inserted in the right upper quadrant anterior axillary line. A second 5-mm cannula was inserted in the subcostal space. A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted into the upper midline. The gallbladder was reflected in a cephalad direction. The gallbladder was punctured with the aspirating needle, and under C-arm fluoroscopy was filled with contrast, filling the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees, which appeared normal. Extra contrast was aspirated and the aspirating needle was removed. The ampulla was grasped with a second grasper, opening the triangle of Calot. The cystic duct was dissected and exposed at its junction with the ampulla, was controlled with a hemoclip, digitally controlled with two clips and divided. This was done while the common duct was in full visualization. The cystic artery was similarly controlled and divided. The gallbladder was dissected from its bed and separated from the liver, brought to the outside through the upper midline cannula and removed. The subhepatic and subphrenic spaces were irrigated thoroughly with saline solution. There was oozing and bleeding from the lateral 5-mm cannula site, but this stopped spontaneously with removal of the cannula. The subphrenic and subhepatic spaces were again irrigated thoroughly with saline until clear. Hemostasis was excellent. CO2 was evacuated and the camera removed. The umbilical fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, the subcu with 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4-0 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied. Sponge and needle counts were correct.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) and gallstones (cholelithiasis).  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as pre‑operative.  \n\nTITLE OF PROCEDURE  \n1. Laparoscopic removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy).  \n2. Intraoperative imaging of the bile ducts (cholangiogram).  \n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia.  \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laid on their back. General anesthesia was given through a breathing tube. The patient received 1 gram of the antibiotic Ancef by IV. The belly was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nA 1‑centimeter cut was made at the belly button and a Veress needle was inserted. A saline test confirmed the needle was in the belly cavity. CO₂ gas was pumped in to create a small space (pressure 14 mmHg). The needle was removed and a 10‑ to 11‑mm tube was put in.  \n\nThe surgeon looked inside and saw a soft gallbladder that was not stuck to anything and could move freely. The liver and the rest of the belly cavity looked normal.  \n\nThree more tubes were inserted: a 5‑mm tube in the right upper belly, another 5‑mm tube below the ribs, and a 10‑ to 11‑mm tube in the upper middle line.  \n\nThe gallbladder was lifted upward. A needle was used to puncture it and, under X‑ray guidance, contrast dye was injected. The dye filled the bile ducts inside and outside the liver, which looked normal. Extra dye was sucked out and the needle was removed.  \n\nA second instrument was used to grab the bile duct opening (ampulla) and open the area called the triangle of Calot. The cystic duct (the small duct that connects the gallbladder to the bile duct) was cut and tied with two clips. The common bile duct was fully visible during this. The cystic artery (the blood vessel feeding the gallbladder) was also tied and cut.  \n\nThe gallbladder was freed from the liver, pulled out through the upper middle tube, and removed. The spaces under the liver and under the diaphragm were washed thoroughly with saline. There was some bleeding from the side 5‑mm tube, but it stopped when the tube was taken out. The spaces were washed again until the fluid was clear. Bleeding was well controlled.  \n\nThe CO₂ gas was released and the camera was taken out. The belly button muscle layer was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl stitches, the skin under the belly button with 3‑0 Vicryl, and the skin itself with 4‑0 nylon. Sterile dressings were put on. All surgical sponges and needles were counted correctly."
