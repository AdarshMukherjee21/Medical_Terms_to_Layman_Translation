  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Melena. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Solitary erosion over a fold at the GE junction, gastric side. PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg IV. REPORTED PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was used. The scope was placed in the upper esophagus under direct visit. The esophageal mucosa was entirely normal. There was no evidence of erosions or ulceration. There was no evidence of varices. The body and antrum of the stomach were normal. They pylorus duodenum bulb and descending duodenum are normal. There was no blood present within the stomach. The scope was then brought back into the stomach and retroflexed in order to inspect the upper portion of the body of the stomach. When this was done, a prominent fold was seen lying along side the GE junction along with gastric side and there was a solitary erosion over this fold. The lesion was not bleeding. If this fold were in any other location of the stomach, I would consider the fold, but at this location, one would have to consider that this would be an isolated gastric varix. As such, the erosion may be more significant. There was no bleeding. Obviously, no manipulation of the lesion was undertaken. The scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated. ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION: 1. Solitary erosion overlying a prominent fold at the gastroesophageal junction, gastric side may simply be an erosion or may be an erosion over a varix. 2. Otherwise unremarkable endoscopy - no evidence of a bleeding lesion of the stomach. PLAN: 1. Liver profile today. 2. Being Nexium 40 mg a day. 3. Scheduled colonoscopy for next week.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Black, tarry stools (melena).  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: A single erosion on a fold at the stomach‑esophagus junction, on the stomach side.  \n\nPREMEDICATIONS: 5 mg of Versed given by IV.  \n\nPROCEDURE:  \n- An Olympus gastroscope was used.  \n- The scope was inserted into the upper esophagus and the lining was normal—no sores, ulcers, or varices.  \n- The body and antrum of the stomach were normal, as were the pylorus, the duodenum bulb, and the descending duodenum.  \n- No blood was seen in the stomach.  \n- The scope was then pulled back into the stomach and bent (retroflexed) to look at the upper part of the stomach body.  \n- A prominent fold was seen along the stomach side of the gastroesophageal junction, and a single erosion was found on this fold.  \n- The erosion was not bleeding.  \n- If this fold were elsewhere in the stomach, it might be a varix; at this location it could be an isolated gastric varix, so the erosion might be more serious.  \n- The lesion was not touched.  \n- The scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure was finished.  \n\nENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:  \n1. One erosion on a prominent fold at the stomach side of the gastroesophageal junction; it could be a simple erosion or an erosion over a varix.  \n2. The rest of the endoscopy was normal—no bleeding lesions in the stomach.  \n\nPLAN:  \n1. Get a liver profile today.  \n2. Take Nexium 40 mg once daily.  \n3. Schedule a colonoscopy for next week."
