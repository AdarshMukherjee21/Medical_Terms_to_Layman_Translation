  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Pelvic inflammatory disease. 2. Periappendicitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Laparoscopic appendectomy. 2. Peritoneal toilet and photos. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 cc. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 31-year-old African-American female who presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain presented with acute appendicitis. She also had mild leukocytosis with bright blood cell count of 12,000. The necessity for diagnostic laparoscopy was explained and possible appendectomy. The patient is agreeable to proceed and signed preoperatively informed consent. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia by Anesthesia Department. The preoperative Foley, antibiotics, and NG tube are placed for decompression and the anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and infraumbilical incision is performed with a #10 blade scalpel with anterior and superior traction on the abdominal wall. A Veress needle was introduced and 15 mm pneumoperitoneum is created with CO2 insufflation. At this point, the Veress needle was removed and a 10 mm trocar is introduced intraperitoneally. A second 5 mm port was introduced in the right upper quadrant under direct visualization and blunted graspers were introduced to bring the appendix into view. With the aid of a laparoscope, the pelvis was visualized. The ovaries are brought in views and photos are taken. There is evidence of a purulence in the cul-de-sac and ________ with a right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst. Attention was then turned on the right lower quadrant. The retrocecal appendix is freed with peritoneal adhesions removed with Endoshears. Attention was turned to the suprapubic area. The 12 mm port was introduced under direct visualization and the mesoappendix was identified. A 45 mm endovascular stapling device was fired across the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix sequentially with no evidence of bleeding or leakage from the staple line. Next, ________ tube was used to obtain Gram stain and cultures of the pelvic fluid and a pelvic toilet was performed with copious irrigation of sterile saline. Next, attention was turned to the right upper quadrant. There is evidence of adhesions from the liver surface to the anterior abdominal wall consistent with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome also a prior pelvic inflammatory disease. All free fluid is aspirated and patient's all port sites are removed under direct visualization and the appendix is submitted to pathology for final pathology. Once the ports are removed the pneumoperitoneum is allowed to escape for patient's postoperative comfort and two larger port sites at the suprapubic and infraumbilical sites are closed with #0 Vicryl suture on a UR-6 needle. Local anesthetic is infiltrated at L3 port sites for postoperative analgesia and #4-0 Vicryl subcuticular closure is performed with undyed Vicryl. Steri-Strips are applied along with sterile dressings. The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and transferred to recovery room with postoperative broad-spectrum IV antibiotics in the General Medical Floor. Routine postoperative care will be continued on this patient.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Acute appendicitis.  \n**Post‑operative diagnoses:** 1. Pelvic inflammatory disease. 2. Periappendicitis.  \n\n**Procedure performed:**  \n1. Laparoscopic removal of the appendix.  \n2. Cleaning of the abdominal cavity and taking pictures.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia.  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**Estimated blood loss:** Less than 10 cc.  \n\n**Indications for the procedure:**  \nA 31‑year‑old African‑American woman came to the hospital with pain in the lower right side of her belly. Blood tests showed a mild increase in white blood cells (12,000). She was told that a diagnostic laparoscopy and possibly an appendectomy were needed. She agreed and signed the consent form before the surgery.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, laid on her back, and given general anesthesia. A urinary catheter, antibiotics, and a nasogastric tube were inserted. The belly was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A small cut was made below the belly button with a #10 blade. A Veress needle was used to create a small amount of gas (CO₂) inside the belly to lift the abdominal wall. The needle was removed and a 10 mm trocar (a small tube) was inserted. A second 5 mm port was placed in the right upper belly. Graspers were used to bring the appendix into view. A camera (laparoscope) showed the pelvis and the ovaries; pictures were taken. There was pus in the lower pelvis and a bleeding cyst on the right ovary.  \n\nThe surgeon then focused on the right lower belly. The appendix, located behind the cecum, was freed from surrounding tissue using endoscopic scissors. A 12 mm port was inserted and the tissue that supplies the appendix (mesoappendix) was found. A 45 mm stapling device was fired to cut and seal the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix. No bleeding or leaks were seen. A tube was used to collect fluid for a Gram stain and culture. The abdominal cavity was washed thoroughly with sterile saline.  \n\nIn the right upper belly, adhesions (scar tissue) were seen between the liver and the abdominal wall, a sign of Fitz‑Hugh‑Curtis syndrome, which is related to previous pelvic inflammatory disease. All fluid was removed. The ports were taken out, the gas was released, and the appendix was sent to pathology.  \n\nThe two larger port sites (above the belly button and near the pubic area) were closed with #0 Vicryl sutures. Local anesthetic was injected at the port sites for pain relief. The skin was closed with #4‑0 Vicryl in a subcuticular stitch. Steri‑Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  \n\nThe patient woke up from anesthesia without problems and was moved to the recovery room on the general medical floor, where she received broad‑spectrum IV antibiotics. Routine postoperative care will continue."
