POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cord compression and cervical spondylosis. In addition to this, he had a large herniated disk at C3-C4 in the midline. PROCEDURE: Anterior cervical discectomy fusion C3-C4 and C4-C5 using operating microscope and the ABC titanium plates fixation with bone black bone procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient placed in the supine position, the neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Incision was made in the midline the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid at the level of C4. Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and vertebral muscles divided longitudinally in the direction of the fibers and the trachea and esophagus was retracted medially. The carotid sheath was retracted laterally after dissecting the longus colli muscle away from the vertebral osteophytes we could see very large osteophytes at C4-C5. It appeared that the C5-C6 disk area had fused spontaneously. We then confirmed that position by taking intraoperative x-rays and then proceeded to do discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5. After placing distraction screws and self-retaining retractors with the teeth beneath the bellies of the longus colli muscles, we then meticulously removed the disk at C3-C4, C4-C5 using the combination of angled strip, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes after we had incised the anulus fibrosus with #15 blade. Next step was to totally decompress the spinal cord using the operating microscope and high-speed cutting followed by the diamond drill with constant irrigation. We then drilled off the uncovertebral osteophytes and midline osteophytes as well as thinning out the posterior longitudinal ligaments. This was then removed with 2-mm Kerrison rongeur. After we removed the posterior longitudinal ligament, we could see the dura pulsating nicely. We did foraminotomies at C3-C4 as well as C4-C5 as well. After having totally decompressed both the cord as well as the nerve roots of C3-C4, C4-C5, we proceeded to the next step, which was a fusion. We sized two 8-mm cortical cancellous grafts and after distracting the bone at C3-C4, C4-C5, we gently tapped the grafts into place. The distraction was removed and the grafts were now within. We went to the next step for the procedure, which was the instrumentation and stabilization of the fused area. We then placed a titanium ABC plate from C3-C5, secured it with 16-mm titanium screws. X-rays showed good position of the screws end plate. The next step was to place Jackson-Pratt drain to the vertebral fascia. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue. Steri-Strips were used for skin closure. Blood loss less than about 200 mL. No complications of the surgery. Needle counts, sponge count, and cottonoid count was correct.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: The patient had cervical spondylotic myelopathy, meaning the spinal cord in the neck was being squeezed by bone changes and disc problems. He also had a large herniated disc at the C3‑C4 level.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: The same conditions were confirmed after surgery.\n\nPROCEDURE: The surgeon performed an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at the C3‑C4 and C4‑C5 levels. A microscope was used, and the fusion was held in place with ABC titanium plates and bone grafts.\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \n1. The patient lay on his back. The neck was cleaned and covered in the usual way.  \n2. A straight cut was made along the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the C4 vertebra.  \n3. The skin, fat, and neck muscles were split along their fibers. The trachea and esophagus were moved toward the middle of the body.  \n4. The carotid sheath was moved to the side after the longus colli muscle was separated from the bone spurs. Large bone spurs were seen at C4‑C5, and the C5‑C6 disc area appeared to have fused on its own. This was confirmed with an X‑ray taken during the operation.  \n5. The surgeon removed the discs at C3‑C4 and C4‑C5 using specialized tools (angled strips, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes) after cutting the outer disc ring with a #15 blade.  \n6. The spinal cord was fully released using the microscope, a high‑speed drill, and a diamond drill with constant irrigation. The bone spurs and the ligament behind the vertebrae were removed with a 2‑mm Kerrison rongeur. The dura (the protective covering of the spinal cord) was seen moving normally.  \n7. The openings for the nerve roots (foraminotomies) at C3‑C4 and C4‑C5 were also widened.  \n8. After the cord and nerve roots were fully decompressed, the surgeon prepared for fusion. Two 8‑mm bone grafts were sized and gently placed into the spaces at C3‑C4 and C4‑C5 after the vertebrae were slightly separated.  \n9. A titanium ABC plate was positioned from C3 to C5 and fixed with 16‑mm titanium screws. X‑rays confirmed the screws were in the correct place.  \n10. A Jackson‑Pratt drain was inserted into the back of the spine. The surgeon ensured there was no bleeding.  \n11. The wound was closed in layers with 2‑0 Vicryl sutures for the tissue under the skin and Steri‑Strips for the skin.  \n12. Blood loss was less than 200 mL. No complications occurred, and all surgical counts (needles, sponges, cottonoids) were correct."
