  "medical": "EXAM: Right foot series. REASON FOR EXAM: Injury. FINDINGS: Three images of the right foot were obtained. On the AP image only, there is a subtle lucency seen in the proximal right fourth metatarsal and a mild increased sclerosis in the proximal fifth metatarsal. Also on a single image, there is a lucency seen in the lateral aspect of the calcaneus that is seen on the oblique image only. Fractures in these bones cannot be completely excluded. There is soft tissue swelling seen overlying the calcaneus within this region. IMPRESSION: Cannot exclude nondisplaced fractures in the lateral aspect of the calcaneus or at the base of the fourth and fifth metatarsals. Recommend correlation with site of pain in addition to conservative management and followup imaging. A phone call will be placed to the emergency room regarding these findings.",
  "layman": "EXAM: X‑rays of the right foot.  \nREASON FOR EXAM: Injury.  \nFINDINGS: Three X‑ray pictures of the right foot were taken. On the front‑to‑back picture, there is a faint dark spot in the upper part of the right fourth metatarsal bone and a slight increase in bone density in the upper part of the right fifth metatarsal. On one picture taken from the side, there is a dark spot on the outer side of the heel bone (calcaneus). These spots could be fractures, but we can’t be sure. There is swelling of the soft tissue over the heel in that area.  \nIMPRESSION: We can’t rule out small, non‑displaced fractures in the outer part of the heel bone or at the base of the fourth and fifth metatarsals. We suggest checking the pain location, using conservative care, and getting follow‑up X‑rays. We will call the emergency room to discuss these findings."
