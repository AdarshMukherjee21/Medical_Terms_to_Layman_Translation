  "medical": "CC: Motor vehicle-bicycle collision. HX: A 5 y/o boy admitted 10/17/92. He was struck while riding his bicycle by a motor vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. First responders found him unconscious with left pupil 6 mm and unreactive and the right pupil 3 mm and reactive. He had bilateral decorticate posturing and was bleeding profusely from his nose and mouth. He was intubated and ventilated in the field, and then transferred to UIHC. PMH/FHX/SHX: unremarkable. MEDS: none EXAM: BP 127/91 HR69 RR30 MS: unconscious and intubated Glasgow coma scale=4 CN: Pupils 6/6 fixed. Corneal reflex: trace OD, absent OS. Gag present on manipulation of endotracheal tube. MOTOR/SENSORY: bilateral decorticate posturing to noxious stimulation (chest). Reflexes: bilaterally. Laceration of mid forehead exposing calvarium. COURSE: Emergent Brain CT scan revealed: Displaced fracture of left calvarium. Left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Right ventricular collection of blood. Right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Significant mass effect with deviation of the midline structures to right. The left ventricle was compressed with obliteration of the suprasellar cistern. Air within the soft tissues in the left infra temporal region. C-spine XR, Abdominal/Chest CT were unremarkable. Patient was taken to the OR emergently and underwent bifrontal craniotomy, evacuation of a small epidural and subdural hematomas, and duraplasty. He was given mannitol enroute to the OR and hyperventilated during and after the procedure. Postoperatively he continued to manifest decerebrate posturing . On 11/16/92 he underwent VP shunting with little subsequent change in his neurological status. On 11/23/92 he underwent tracheostomy. On 12/11/92 he underwent bifrontal acrylic prosthesis implantation for repair of the bifrontal craniectomy. By the time of discharge, 1/14/93, he tracked relatively well OD, but had a CN3 palsy OS. He had relatively severe extensor rigidity in all extremities (R&gt;L). His tracheotomy was closed prior to discharge. A 11/16/92 Brain MRI demonstrated infarction in the upper brain stem (particularly in the Pons), left cerebellum, right basil ganglia and thalamus. He was initially treated for seizure prophylaxis with DPH, but developed neutropenia, so it was discontinued. He developed seizures within several months of discharge and was placed on VPA (Depakene). This decreased seizure frequency but his liver enzymes became elevated and he changed over to Tegretol. 10/8/93 Brain MRI (one year after MVA) revealed interval appearance of hydrocephalus, abnormal increased T2 signal (in the medulla, right pons, both basal ganglia, right frontal and left occipital regions), a small mid-brain, and a right subdural fluid collection. These findings were consistent with diffuse axonal injury of the white matter and gray matter contusion, and signs of a previous right subdural hematoma. He was last seen 10/30/96 in the pediatric neurology clinic--age 9 years. He was averaging 2-3 seizures per day---characterized by extension of BUE with tremor and audible cry or laughter---on Tegretol and Diazepam. In addition he experiences 24-48hour periods of &quot;startle response (myoclonic movement of the shoulders)&quot; with or without stimulation every 6 weeks. He had limited communication skills (sparse speech). On exam he had disconjugate gaze, dilated/fixed left pupil, spastic quadriplegia.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: A 5‑year‑old boy was hit by a fast car while riding a bicycle.  \n\nHistory: He was admitted on Oct 17 1992. Emergency responders found him unconscious. His left pupil was 6 mm and did not react; his right pupil was 3 mm and did react. He had abnormal stiff movements of both arms and legs (decorticate posturing) and was bleeding a lot from his nose and mouth. He was put on a breathing tube and ventilated in the ambulance, then taken to UIHC. Past medical, family, and social history were normal. He was not on any medications.  \n\nExamination: Blood pressure 127/91 mm Hg, heart rate 69 bpm, breathing 30 breaths/min. He was unconscious and on a breathing tube; Glasgow Coma Scale 4. Both pupils were fixed at 6 mm. Corneal reflex was weak on the right and absent on the left. Gag reflex was present when the breathing tube was moved. He had abnormal stiff movements in response to pain on the chest. Reflexes were present on both sides. He had a cut on the middle of his forehead that exposed the skull bone.  \n\nCourse: An emergency brain CT scan showed a displaced fracture of the left skull, bleeding inside the left front‑parietal brain, bleeding in the right ventricle, bleeding inside the right brain, and a large pressure that pushed the brain’s midline to the right. The left ventricle was squeezed and the space above the pituitary gland was gone. Air was seen in the soft tissues under the left ear. X‑ray of the neck and CT scans of the abdomen and chest were normal. He was taken to the operating room right away and had a bifrontal craniotomy to remove a small epidural and subdural hematoma and a duraplasty. He received mannitol on the way to the OR and was hyperventilated during and after surgery. After surgery he still had abnormal stiff movements. On Nov 16 1992 he had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed, but his neurological status did not improve much. On Nov 23 1992 he had a tracheostomy. On Dec 11 1992 he had a bifrontal acrylic prosthesis placed to repair the skull defect. By the time he was discharged on Jan 14 1993 he could track objects with his right eye, but his left eye had a CN III palsy. He had severe stiffness in all limbs, worse on the right. His tracheostomy was closed before discharge.  \n\nA brain MRI on Nov 16 1992 showed an infarction in the upper brain stem (especially the pons), left cerebellum, right basal ganglia, and thalamus. He was started on diphenhydramine for seizure prevention, but it caused low white blood cells, so it was stopped. He had seizures several months after discharge and was started on valproate (Depakene). This reduced seizures but raised liver enzymes, so he was switched to carbamazepine (Tegretol).  \n\nA brain MRI on Oct 8 1993 (one year after the accident) showed hydrocephalus, abnormal high T2 signal in the medulla, right pons, both basal ganglia, right frontal, and left occipital areas, a small midbrain lesion, and a right subdural fluid collection. These findings were consistent with diffuse axonal injury and a previous right subdural hematoma.  \n\nHe was last seen on Oct 30 1996 in the pediatric neurology clinic at age 9. He had about 2–3 seizures per day, characterized by extending his arms with tremor and audible crying or laughing, while on Tegretol and diazepam. He also had 24–48 hour periods of startle responses (myoclonic shoulder jerks) with or without stimulation every 6 weeks. He had limited speech. On exam he had misaligned eyes, a dilated/fixed left pupil, and spastic quadriplegia."
