  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lateral epicondylitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lateral epicondylitis. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Lateral release with lengthening of the ECRB tendon. ANESTHESIA: General. TOURNIQUET TIME: minutes. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated and the tourniquet elevated to 290 mm/Hg. An incision was made over the lateral aspect of the right elbow anterior to lateral epicondyle and centered on the lateral epicondyle. Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia. The interval between the extensor carpi radialis longus and anterior edge of the extensor aponeurosis was identified. The antebrachial fascia was then incised and further blunt dissection developed the interval between ECRL and extensor aponeurosis from the lateral epicondyle distal to the joint line. The ECRL was then released by sharp dissection and retracted anterior to expose the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis. Medial dissection further delineated the origin of the ECRB. The origin of the ECRB was then further inspected and gross pathological changes of grayish tissue were identified and this friable tissue was then excised. The joint capsule was then incised. The radial capitellar joint was inspected and found to be without pathological changes. The wound was then copiously irrigated. The joint capsule was closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The ECRB was then lengthened and then sutured to the undersurface of the ECRL using 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The antebrachial fascia was closed with a running 3-0 Vicryl suture with a Krackow technique. The wound was then infiltrated with 10 cc of .025% Marcaine. The skin was closed in a layered fashion. Sterile dressings were applied. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory procedure having tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow).  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lateral epicondylitis.  \nOPERATIONS PERFORMED: Lateral release and lengthening of the ECRB tendon.  \nANESTHESIA: General (the patient was fully asleep).  \nTOURNIQUET TIME: minutes.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nWhile the patient was fully asleep, the arm was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The arm was drained of blood and a tourniquet was set to 290 mm/Hg. A small cut was made on the outer side of the right elbow, just in front of the lateral epicondyle. Using gentle blunt tools, the outer layer of the forearm (antebrachial fascia) was exposed. The space between the long wrist‑extending muscle (ECRL) and the front edge of the wrist‑extending sheet (extensor aponeurosis) was found. The outer layer was cut and more blunt dissection was done to separate the ECRL from the sheet from the elbow down to the joint line. The ECRL was then cut and pulled forward to show where the short wrist‑extending muscle (ECRB) starts. Further dissection showed the ECRB’s origin. The surgeon saw grayish, weak tissue at the ECRB’s start and removed it. The joint capsule was cut open. The joint itself was checked and was normal. The wound was washed thoroughly. The joint capsule was stitched closed with 3‑0 Vicryl stitches. The ECRB tendon was lengthened and stitched to the underside of the ECRL with 3‑0 Vicryl stitches. The outer forearm layer was closed with a running 3‑0 Vicryl stitch using a Krackow technique. The wound was given 10 cc of 0.025% Marcaine (local anesthetic). The skin was closed in layers. Sterile dressings were put on. The tourniquet was released. The patient woke up from anesthesia and went to the recovery room, having tolerated the surgery well."
