  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Patellar tendon retinaculum ruptures, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Patellar tendon retinaculum ruptures, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Patellar tendon and medial and lateral retinaculum repair, right knee. SPECIFICATIONS: Intraoperative procedure done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #2 of ABCD Hospital. This was done under subarachnoid block anesthetic in supine position. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American male who suffered acute rupture of his patellar tendon diagnosed both by exam as well as x-ray the evening before surgical intervention. He did this while playing basketball. He had a massive deficit at the inferior pole of his patella on exam. Once opened, he had complete rupture of this patellar tendon as well as a complete rupture of his medial lateral retinaculum. Minimal cartilaginous pieces were at the patellar tendon. He had grade II changes to his femoral sulcus as well as grade I-II changes to the undersurface of the patella. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine on the operative table receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. A thigh high tourniquet was placed. He is prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Limb was elevated, exsanguinated and tourniquet placed at 325 mmHg for approximately 30 to 40 minutes. Straight incision is carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue anteriorly. Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation. Patellar tendon was isolated along with the patella itself. A 6 mm Dacron tape x2 was placed with a modified Kessler tendon stitch with a single limb both medially and laterally and a central limb with subsequent shared tape. The inferior pole was freshened up. Drill bit was utilized to make holes x3 longitudinally across the patella and the limbs strutted up through the patella with a suture passer. This was tied over the bony bridge superiorly. There was excellent reduction of the tendon to the patella. Interrupted running #1-Vicryl suture was utilized for over silk. A running #2-0 Vicryl for synovial closure medial and laterally as well as #1-Vicryl medial and lateral retinaculum. There was excellent repair. Copious irrigation was carried out. Tourniquet was dropped and hemostasis controlled via electrocoagulation. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed through the skin. Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril were placed for compression dressing. Digits were warm and no brawny pulses present at the end of the case. The patient's leg was placed in a Don-Joy brace 0 to 20 degrees of flexion. He will leave this until seen in the office. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.",

He was examined and an X‑ray the night before surgery confirmed the tear. On exam he could not lift his knee because the tendon was completely torn. During the operation the surgeon saw a full tear of the patellar tendon and the medial and lateral retinaculum. Only a few small pieces of cartilage were left on the tendon. He also had mild changes in the groove of the femur (grade II) and mild to moderate changes on the underside of the patella (grade I‑II).  \n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient lay on his back on the operating table. A spinal block was given by the anesthesia team. A thigh‑high tourniquet was applied. The leg was cleaned and covered in sterile drapes. The leg was lifted, blood was let out, and the tourniquet was set to 325 mmHg for about 30‑40 minutes. A straight cut was made through the skin and fat in front of the knee. Bleeding was stopped with an electric cautery device. The patellar tendon and the patella were exposed. Two 6‑mm Dacron tapes were used with a special stitch (modified Kessler) on both sides of the tendon and a central stitch that shared the tape. The torn end of the tendon was cleaned. Three holes were drilled through the patella. The tape was passed through these holes and tied over the bone. The tendon was put back in place on the patella. A running stitch (Vicryl #1) was used to close the tissue over the tendon. A running stitch (Vicryl #2‑0) closed the synovial tissue on the inside of the knee, and a running stitch (Vicryl #1) closed the medial and lateral retinaculum. The repair looked good. The area was washed thoroughly. The tourniquet was released and bleeding was stopped again with cautery. A running stitch (Vicryl #2‑0) closed the fat layer and skin staples were placed on the skin. A compression dressing (Adaptic, 4 × 4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril) was applied. The toes were warm and there were no strong pulses in the leg at the end of the surgery. The leg was put in a Don‑Joy brace that allows 0‑20° of knee bend. The patient will keep the brace until his next office visit. The expected outcome of the surgery is fair."
