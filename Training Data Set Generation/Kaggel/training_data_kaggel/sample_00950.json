  "medical": "EXAM: Single frontal view of the chest. HISTORY: Respiratory distress. The patient has a history of malrotation. The patient is back for a re-anastomosis of the bowel with no acute distress. TECHNIQUE: Single frontal view of the chest was evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated MM/DD/YY. FINDINGS: A single frontal view of the chest was evaluated. It reveals interval placement of an ET tube and an NG tube. ET tube is midway between the patient's thoracic inlet and carina. NG tube courses with the distal tip in the left upper quadrant beneath the left hemidiaphragm. There is no evidence of any focal areas of consolidation, pneumothoraces, or pleural effusions. The mediastinum seen was slightly prominent; however, this may be secondary to thymus and/or technique. There is a slight increase seen with regards to the central pulmonary vessels. Again, this may represent a minimal amount of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is paucity of bowel gas seen in the upper abdomen. The osseous thorax appears to be grossly intact and symmetrical. Slightly low lung volumes, however, this may be secondary to the film being taken on the expiratory phase of respiration. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of any focal areas of consolidation, pneumothoraces, or pleural effusions. 2. Slight prominence to the mediastinum which may be secondary to thymus and/or technique. 3. Slight prominence of some of the central pulmonary vasculature which may represent a minimal amount of vascular congestion.",
  "layman": "EXAM: One front‑on chest X‑ray.  \nHISTORY: The patient is breathing badly. They have a past problem with the intestines being turned the wrong way. They are back for a bowel surgery that reconnects the intestines and are not in urgent distress.  \n\nTECHNIQUE: The front chest X‑ray was taken and compared with an earlier film from MM/DD/YY.  \n\nFINDINGS: The X‑ray shows an endotracheal (ET) tube and a nasogastric (NG) tube. The ET tube is halfway between the top of the chest and the trachea’s lower part. The NG tube ends in the upper left part of the abdomen, below the left side of the diaphragm. There are no signs of lung infection, collapsed lung, or fluid around the lungs. The middle part of the chest (mediastinum) looks a little larger, probably because of the thymus or how the picture was taken. The main lung blood vessels look a bit bigger, which could mean a small amount of lung congestion. There is very little gas in the upper abdomen. The bones of the chest look normal and symmetrical. The lungs look a bit smaller, likely because the picture was taken while the patient was exhaling.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. No lung infection, collapsed lung, or fluid around the lungs.  \n2. The mediastinum is slightly larger, probably due to the thymus or the way the X‑ray was taken.  \n3. The main lung blood vessels are slightly larger, which may indicate a small amount of lung congestion."
