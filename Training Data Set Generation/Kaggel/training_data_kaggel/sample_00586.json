  "medical": "CC: Weakness. HX: This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. MEDS: none. PMH: see above. FHX: Father with Von Hippel-Lindau Disease. SHX: retired truck driver. smokes 1-3 packs of cigarettes per day, but denied alcohol use. He is divorced and has two sons who are healthy. He lives with his mother. ROS: noncontributory. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Thought process lucid and appropriate. CN: unremarkable exept for 4+/4+ strength of the trapezeii. No retinal hemangioblastoma were seen. MOTOR: 4-/4- strength in proximal and distal upper extremities. There is diffuse atrophy and claw-hands, bilaterally. He is unable to manipulate hads to any great extent. 4+/4+ strength throughout BLE. There is also diffuse atrophy throughout the lower extremities though not as pronounced as in the upper extremities. SENSORY: There was a right T3 and left T8 cord levels to PP on the posterior thorax. Decreased LT in throughout the 4 extremities. COORD: difficult to assess due to weakness. Station: BUE pronator drift. Gait: stands without assistance, but can only manage to walk a few steps. Spastic gait. Reflexes: Hyperreflexic on left (3+) and Hyporeflexic on right (1). Babinski signs were present bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: 9/8/95, GS normal. By 11/14/95, he required NGT feeding due to dysphagia and aspiration risk confirmed on cookie swallow studies.MRI Brain, 2/19/96, revealed several lesions (hemangioblastoma) in the cerebellum and brain stem. There were postoperative changes and a cyst in the medulla. On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna. The largest of which measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 2.0cm. There are also several large ring enhancing lesions in cerebellum. The lesions were felt to be consistent with hemangioblastoma. No surgical or medical intervention was initiated. Visiting nursing was provided. He has since been followed by his local physician",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Weakness.  \n\n**History:**  \nA 30‑year‑old man was healthy until July 1993, when he first felt weakness in his right arm and neck pain. He saw a chiropractor, but after some time his right hand became smaller and stiff. He then went to a neurosurgeon. A CT scan of his neck on September 25 1992 showed a growth inside the spinal cord at levels C2‑C3 and another outside the cord at C6‑C7. He had surgery (laminectomy from C6 to T1) to open the spine and relieve pressure on the cord. He improved for about three months, but then his symptoms worsened. He developed tingling on the left side and weakness in both arms, worse on the right. He also had trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and very strong reflexes.  \n\nAn MRI on August 31 1993 showed his cervical and thoracic spine were enlarged and there were several bright spots in the back part of his brain. On September 1 1993 he had brain surgery (suboccipital craniotomy) to remove a tumor. The biopsy showed it was a hemangioblastoma, a type of blood‑vessel tumor. His symptoms then stabilized. He received radiation therapy from September 1993 to January 1994: 5,040 cGy in 28 sessions to the brain and 3,600 cGy in 20 sessions to the cervical and thoracic spine.  \n\nIn October 1995 he was seen in a neuro‑oncology clinic to discuss chemotherapy. He reported that all four arms and legs were getting weaker, especially the upper arms, and he had trouble swallowing. He could not put on his shirt or lift his arms easily, and he could not feed himself with utensils. He could climb stairs but had trouble going down. He had no bowel or bladder problems. He was not taking any medications.  \n\nPast medical history is as described above.  \nFamily history: his father had Von Hippel‑Lindau disease.  \nSocial history: retired truck driver, smokes 1‑3 packs of cigarettes a day, does not drink alcohol. He is divorced, has two healthy sons, and lives with his mother.  \n\nReview of systems was normal.  \n\n**Examination:**  \nVital signs normal. He was alert and oriented. Speech was clear. Thinking was normal. Cranial nerves were normal except his trapezius muscles had normal strength. No eye tumors were seen.  \n\nMotor exam: his upper arms and hands had 4‑/4‑ strength (out of 5) and showed muscle wasting and claw‑hand deformities on both sides. He could not use his hands well. His lower arms and legs had 4+/4+ strength. His lower body also had muscle wasting, but less than his upper body.  \n\nSensory: he had loss of pain and temperature sensation at the right T3 level and left T8 level on the back of his chest. He had decreased light touch in all four limbs.  \n\nCoordination was hard to test because of weakness. His arms drifted when he tried to hold them straight. He could stand without help but could only walk a few steps and his gait was spastic. Reflexes were very strong on the left (3+) and weak on the right (1). Babinski sign was present on both feet. General exam was normal.  \n\n**Course:**  \nOn September 8 1995 his general status was normal. By November 14 1995 he needed a feeding tube because of swallowing problems and risk of aspiration, confirmed by a swallow study. An MRI of his brain on February 19 1996 showed several hemangioblastoma lesions in the cerebellum and brain stem, plus changes from surgery and a cyst in the medulla.  \n\nOn October 25 1996 he had about a week of numbness in both legs from the mid‑thigh down to his toes, and worsening leg weakness. He developed pressure sores on his buttocks. He also had occasional urinary retention for a month, shortness of breath, and swallowing problems. He had been sitting all day because he could not move well and had no help during the day. His exam matched his complaints. He had no sweating, headaches, or high blood pressure.  \n\nAn MRI of his cervical‑thoracic spine on October 26 1996 showed a large fluid cavity (syrinx) extending down to T10. It also showed the previous surgery at C6‑T1 and swelling of the spinal cord. There were multiple nodular lesions inside the spinal canal and in the cisterna magna that were bright on T2, normal on T1, and enhanced with gadolinium. The largest was 1.1 × 1.0 × 2.0 cm. There were also several ring‑shaped lesions in the cerebellum. These were thought to be hemangioblastomas. No surgery or medication was started. He received visiting nursing care and has been followed by his local doctor."
