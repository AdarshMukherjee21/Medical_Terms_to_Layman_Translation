  "medical": "EXAM: CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. INDICATIONS: Abdominal pain. TECHNIQUE: CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after 100 mL of intravenous Isovue-300 contrast administration. Oral contrast was not administered. There was no comparison of studies. FINDINGS CT PELVIS: Within the pelvis, the uterus demonstrates a thickened-appearing endometrium. There is also a 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm hypodense mass in the cervix and lower uterine segment of uncertain etiology. There is also a 2.5 cm intramural hypodense mass involving the dorsal uterine fundus likely representing a fibroid. Several smaller fibroids were also suspected. The ovaries are unremarkable in appearance. There is no free pelvic fluid or adenopathy. CT ABDOMEN: The appendix has normal appearance in the right lower quadrant. There are few scattered diverticula in the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis. The small and large bowels are otherwise unremarkable. The stomach is grossly unremarkable. There is no abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy. There are no adrenal masses. The kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are in unremarkable appearance. The spleen contains several small calcified granulomas, but no evidence of masses. It is normal in size. The lung bases are clear bilaterally. The osseous structures are unremarkable other than mild facet degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1. IMPRESSION: 1. Hypoattenuating mass in the lower uterine segment and cervix of uncertain etiology measuring approximately 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm. 2. Multiple uterine fibroids. 3. Prominent endometrium. 4. Followup pelvic ultrasound is recommended.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  \n**Reason for the scan:** Abdominal pain.  \n\n**How it was done:** A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was taken after giving 100 mL of IV contrast (Isovue‑300). No oral contrast was used. There was no previous study to compare with.  \n\n**Findings**\n\n*Pelvis:*  \n- The uterus shows a thickened lining (endometrium).  \n- There is a 4.4 × 2.5 × 3.4 cm low‑density mass in the cervix and lower part of the uterus; its cause is unclear.  \n- A 2.5 cm low‑density mass in the back part of the uterus likely is a fibroid.  \n- Several smaller fibroids are also suspected.  \n- The ovaries look normal.  \n- No free fluid or swollen lymph nodes in the pelvis.  \n\n*Abdomen:*  \n- The appendix looks normal.  \n- A few small pouches (diverticula) are seen in the sigmoid colon, but there is no inflammation (diverticulitis).  \n- The small and large intestines, stomach, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas all appear normal.  \n- No enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen or behind the kidneys.  \n- No adrenal gland masses.  \n- The spleen has several small calcified spots (granulomas) but no masses; it is the normal size.  \n- The lower lungs are clear.  \n- The bones are normal except for mild wear‑and‑tear changes in the lower back (L4‑L5 and L5‑S1).  \n\n**Impression**\n\n1. A low‑density mass in the lower uterus and cervix, about 4.4 × 2.5 × 3.4 cm, cause unknown.  \n2. Multiple fibroids in the uterus.  \n3. Thickened uterine lining.  \n4. A follow‑up pelvic ultrasound is recommended."
