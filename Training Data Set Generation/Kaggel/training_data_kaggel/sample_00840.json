  "medical": "EXAM: CT stone protocol. REASON FOR EXAM: History of stones, rule out stones. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis per renal stone protocol. FINDINGS: Correlation is made with a prior examination dated 01/20/09. Again identified are small intrarenal stones bilaterally. These are unchanged. There is no hydronephrosis or significant ureteral dilatation. There is no stone along the expected course of the ureters or within the bladder. There is a calcification in the low left pelvis not in line with ureter, this finding is stable and is compatible with a phlebolith. There is no asymmetric renal enlargement or perinephric stranding. The appendix is normal. There is no evidence of a pericolonic inflammatory process or small bowel obstruction. Scans through the pelvis disclose no free fluid or adenopathy. Lung bases aside from very mild dependent atelectasis appear clear. Given the lack of contrast, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas are grossly unremarkable. The gallbladder is present. There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy. IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral intrarenal stones, no obstruction. 2. Normal appendix.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan for kidney stones.  \n**Reason for exam:** You have a history of stones; we want to see if there are any new stones.  \n**Technique:** A non‑contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done following the kidney‑stone protocol.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- Compared with a scan from 01/20/09, the same small stones are still present in both kidneys and have not changed.  \n- The kidneys are not swollen and the tubes that carry urine (ureters) are not enlarged.  \n- No stones were found in the ureters or the bladder.  \n- A small calcified spot was seen in the lower left pelvis; it is not in the ureter and looks like a harmless blood‑clot stone (phlebolith).  \n- The kidneys are the same size and there is no swelling around them.  \n- The appendix looks normal.  \n- There is no sign of inflammation near the colon or blockage of the small intestine.  \n- The pelvis area shows no free fluid or swollen lymph nodes.  \n- The lower lungs are clear except for a very mild collapse of the lung tissue at the bottom.  \n- Because no contrast was used, the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas look normal.  \n- The gallbladder is present and normal.  \n- No free fluid or abnormal lymph nodes were seen in the abdomen.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Small stones in both kidneys, but they are not blocking urine flow.  \n2. Normal appendix."
