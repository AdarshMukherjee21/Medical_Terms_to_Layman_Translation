  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT FOOT CLINICAL: A 49-year-old female with ankle pain times one month, without a specific injury. Patient complains of moderate to severe pain, worse with standing or walking on hard surfaces, with tenderness to palpation at the plantar aspect of the foot and midfoot region and tenderness over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. FINDINGS: Received for second opinion interpretations is an MRI examination performed on 05/27/2005. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space extending along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space posterior to the Achilles tendon. Findings suggest altered biomechanics with crural fascial strains. There is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus with mild tendon thickening. There is possible partial surface tearing of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus (axial inversion recovery image #16) which is a possible hypertrophic tear less than 50% in cross sectional diameter. The study has been performed with the foot in neutral position. Confirmation of this possible partial tendon tear would require additional imaging with the foot in a plantar flexed position with transaxial images of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus oriented perpendicular to the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. There is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths consistent with flexor splinting but intrinsically normal tendons. Normal peroneal tendons. There is tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with thickening but no demonstrated tendon tear. Normal extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum tendons. Normal Achilles tendon. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 2cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon. Normal distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex. Normal lateral, subtalar and deltoid ligamentous complexes. There are no erosions of the inferior neck of the talus and there are no secondary findings of a midfoot pronating force. Normal plantar fascia. There is no plantar calcaneal spur. There is venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot extending along the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves which may be acting as intermittent entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves. Normal tibiotalar, subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux was partially excluded from the field-of-view of this examination. IMPRESSION: Tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening and possible surface fraying / tearing of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus, however, confirmation of this finding would require additional imaging. Minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths, consistent with flexor splinting. Edema of the subcutis adipose space along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle suggesting altered biomechanics and crural fascial strain. Mild tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with mild tendon thickening. Normal plantar fascia and no plantar fasciitis. Venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot which may be acting as entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the left foot  \nCLINICAL: A 49‑year‑old woman has had ankle pain for about a month. She didn’t have a clear injury. She says the pain is moderate to severe and gets worse when she stands or walks on hard ground. The pain is tender when pressed on the bottom of her foot, the middle of her foot, and along the back of the tibialis posterior tendon.\n\nFINDINGS: This MRI was taken on 05/27/2005 and is being reviewed for a second opinion.  \n- There is swelling (edema) in the fat under the skin on both the inside and outside of the ankle.  \n- There is also swelling behind the Achilles tendon.  \n- These changes suggest that the way she moves her leg may be off‑balance, causing strain on the leg’s fascia.  \n- The tibialis posterior tendon, which wraps around the inside of the ankle bone, is thickened and shows signs of wear (tendinosis).  \n- There may be a small tear on the front surface of this tendon just below the ankle bone (less than 50% of the tendon’s width). To confirm this tear, another scan with the foot turned down (plantar‑flexed) would be needed.  \n- The tendons that help flex the toes (flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus) have a little inflammation in their sheaths, which is common when the tendons are overused, but the tendons themselves look normal.  \n- The peroneal tendons (on the outside of the ankle) are normal.  \n- The tibialis anterior tendon (which lifts the front of the foot) is thickened but shows no tear.  \n- The tendons that lift the big toe and other toes (extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum) are normal.  \n- The Achilles tendon is normal.  \n- The soleus muscle (behind the calf) extends close to the Achilles tendon’s attachment.  \n- The ligaments that hold the lower tibia and fibula together, the lateral ankle ligaments, the subtalar joint, and the deltoid ligament are all normal.  \n- The lower part of the talus bone (ankle bone) shows no erosion, and there are no signs of a force that would pull the midfoot outward.  \n- The plantar fascia (bottom of the foot) is normal and there is no heel spur.  \n- The veins under the foot are enlarged along the nerves that run on the inside and outside of the foot, which might sometimes pinch those nerves.  \n- The ankle joint, subtalar joint, talonavicular joint, and calcaneocuboid joint are all normal.  \n- The joint of the big toe was not fully captured in this scan.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n- The tibialis posterior tendon is thickened and shows signs of wear, with a possible small surface tear just below the ankle bone; a confirmatory scan would be needed.  \n- There is mild inflammation in the sheaths of the toe‑flexing tendons, typical of overuse.  \n- Swelling in the skin fat around the ankle suggests altered movement mechanics and strain on the leg fascia.  \n- The tibialis anterior tendon is mildly thickened but not torn.  \n- The plantar fascia is normal, with no heel spur.  \n- Enlarged foot veins may intermittently pinch the nerves that run along the inside and outside of the foot."
