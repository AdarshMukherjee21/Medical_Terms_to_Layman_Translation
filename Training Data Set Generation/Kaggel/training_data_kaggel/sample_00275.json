POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6, greater than C6-C7 and C4-C5 with left radiculopathy. 2. Cervical stenosis with cord compression, C5-C6 (723.0), with surgical findings confirmed. PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior cervical discectomy at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 for neural decompression (63075, 63076, 63076). 2. Anterior interbody fusion at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 (22554, 22585, 22585) utilizing Bengal cages times three (22851). 3. Anterior instrumentation for stabilization by Slim-LOC plate C4, C5, C6, and C7 (22846); with intraoperative x-ray times two. ANESTHESIA: General. SERVICE: Neurosurgery. OPERATION: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces. Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner. Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided. The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status. The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away. Appropriate size Bengal cages were filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position, filled along with fusion putty, and once these were quite tightly applied and checked, further stability was added by the placement of a Slim-LOC plate of appropriate size with appropriate size screws, and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and inspected, and hemostasis was completely achieved and finally the wound was closed in a routine closure by approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was sterilely dressed, and incorporated a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in a routine fashion. At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses:**  \n1. A herniated disc at the C5‑C6 level that is larger than the herniations at C6‑C7 and C4‑C5, causing pain and weakness on the left side.  \n2. Narrowing of the neck spine (cervical stenosis) that is pressing on the spinal cord at C5‑C6 (ICD code 723.0).\n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses:**  \nThe same two conditions were confirmed during surgery.\n\n**Procedures performed:**  \n1. Removed the damaged disc material at C4‑C5, C5‑C6, and C6‑C7 to relieve pressure on the nerves.  \n2. Placed bone‑graft cages (Bengal cages) at the same three levels to fuse the vertebrae together.  \n3. Added a metal plate (Slim‑LOC) and screws from C4 to C7 to keep the spine stable.  \nX‑ray images were taken during the operation.\n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia (the patient was fully unconscious).\n\n**Service:** Neurosurgery.\n\n**Operation summary:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, laid on their back, and put under general anesthesia. The front of the neck was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A straight cut was made just to the right of the midline, down to the muscle that covers the neck. The surgeon lifted the muscle and reached the space in front of the spine. Large bony growths (osteophytes) were seen and removed with a bone‑cutting tool. The surgeon then cut open the discs at C4‑C5, C5‑C6, and C6‑C7 and removed the damaged disc material. Any remaining disc fragments were drilled away to open the space all the way to the spinal canal. The surgeon also removed a ligament that was pressing on the nerves. The spinal cord was fully exposed and the nerve roots were checked and found to be free of pressure.\n\nThe wound was washed with an antibiotic solution and bleeding was stopped with gelfoam. Bone graft material from the patient was packed into the cages, which were then placed into the disc spaces and secured with bone‑filling putty. A Slim‑LOC plate was attached to the front of the vertebrae with screws to add extra stability. X‑ray images confirmed that everything was properly aligned.\n\nThe wound was irrigated again, checked for bleeding, and closed in layers: the muscle was stitched together with 3‑0 Vicryl, the skin was closed with a 4‑0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch, and a sterile dressing was applied. A Penrose drain was placed to remove any fluid and was secured with a safety pin. All instruments, needles, and sponges were counted correctly, and no complications occurred during the surgery."
