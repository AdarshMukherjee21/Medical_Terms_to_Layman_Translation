  "medical": "MM/DD/YYYY XYZ, D.C. 60 Evergreen Place Suite 902 East Orange, NJ 07018 Re: ABC Dear Dr. XYZ: ABC was evaluated today, MM/DD/YYYY, in follow up evaluation. He continues to suffer from neck and lower back pain radiating into both arms and both legs with numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in both arms. He had moderate relief with his prior trigger point injections for approximately one month. His evaluation today continues to reveal restriction of range of motion of the cervical and lumbar region with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature. The exam otherwise was unchanged. Palpable trigger points were noted bilaterally in the lumbar paraspinal musculature. He continues to suffer from ongoing myofascitis and his treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections, which were performed today. He tolerated the procedure well. He is to ice the region intermittently for 15 minutes off and on x 3 and he will be followed for repeat trigger point injections in two weeks' time if indicated. He is to continue with his treatment program under your care and supervision. Yours sincerely,",

He still has neck and lower back pain that spreads into both arms and legs, along with numbness, tingling, and a pins‑and‑needles feeling in his arms. His previous trigger‑point injections helped a little for about a month. Today, his neck and lower back still feel stiff and sore, and the muscles next to his spine are tight and tender. The rest of the exam was the same as before. We found trigger points on both sides of his lower back muscles. ABC still has ongoing muscle inflammation, so we gave him more trigger‑point injections today. He handled the injections well. He should apply ice to the area for 15 minutes on and off, three times a day. We will check him again in two weeks for more injections if needed. Please keep him on your treatment program and supervise his care.\n\nSincerely,"
