  "medical": "ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT) The patient is to undergo a course of angioplasty for in-stent restenosis. The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site. After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter. The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy. The does per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter. Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.",
  "layman": "ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT)\n\nThe patient will have angioplasty to treat a narrowing that has occurred inside a stent. For the radiation part, we will use simulation films to plan the treatment. We will place markers from the Novoste catheter on both sides of the damaged artery. Then we will calculate how long the radioactive strontium sources should stay in place to give the right dose, based on the artery’s size.\n\nThis treatment works better than blade or laser atherectomy because of the way radiation affects the tissue. The dose for each session is tailored to the patient using the same principles and the artery’s size.\n\nBecause the radiation source delivers a very high dose quickly, there is a risk of serious side effects such as heart attack or equipment failure. Therefore, I will closely monitor the patient for changes in the heart’s electrical activity (ST segment elevation) and make sure the machine is working properly."
