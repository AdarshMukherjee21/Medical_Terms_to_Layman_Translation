  "medical": "EXAM: CT cervical spine. REASON FOR EXAM: MVA, feeling sleepy, headache, shoulder and rib pain. TECHNIQUE: Axial images through the cervical spine with coronal and sagittal reconstructions. FINDINGS: There is reversal of the normal cervical curvature at the vertebral body heights. The intervertebral disk spaces are otherwise maintained. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The facets are aligned. The tip of the clivus and occiput appear intact. On the coronal reconstructed sequence, there is satisfactory alignment of C1 on C2, no evidence of a base of dens fracture. The included portions of the first and second ribs are intact. There is no evidence of a posterior element fracture. Included portions of the mastoid air cells appear clear. There is no CT evidence of a moderate or high-grade stenosis. IMPRESSION: No acute process, cervical spine.",
  "layman": "EXAM: CT scan of the neck bones.  \nREASON FOR EXAM: Car accident, feeling drowsy, headache, pain in the shoulder and ribs.  \nTECHNIQUE: Images taken from top to bottom of the neck with side and front‑back views.  \n\nFINDINGS: The normal gentle curve of the neck bones is reversed at the bone heights. The spaces between the discs are still normal. There is no swelling of the soft tissue in front of the bones. The joint surfaces line up correctly. The top part of the skull and the base of the skull look normal. The side view shows that the first neck bone (C1) sits properly on the second neck bone (C2) and there is no break at the base of the dens. The parts of the first and second ribs that were included in the scan are intact. No break is seen in the back parts of the bones. The air cells in the mastoid area look clear. The scan does not show any moderate or severe narrowing of the spinal canal.  \n\nIMPRESSION: No new or urgent problems in the cervical spine."
