  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right renal mass. 2. Hematuria. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right renal mass. 2. Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Right retrograde pyelogram. 3. Right ureteral pyeloscopy. 4. Right renal biopsy. 5. Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement. ANESTHESIA: Sedation. SPECIMEN: Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies. INDICATION: The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria. He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria. He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation. PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder. The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing. Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder. There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice. A retrograde pyelogram was performed. Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side. At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire. The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities. The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire. The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance. The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter. The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction. The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed. A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation. The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system. Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system. The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass. Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed. The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis. The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room. It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy. He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses:**  \n1. Mass in the right kidney.  \n2. Blood in the urine.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses:**  \n1. Mass in the right kidney.  \n2. Blockage at the junction where the ureter meets the kidney (right ureteropelvic junction).  \n\n**Procedures performed:**  \n1. Cystourethroscopy (look inside the bladder and urethra).  \n2. Right retrograde pyelogram (X‑ray of the right kidney and ureter).  \n3. Right ureteral pyeloscopy (look inside the right ureter).  \n4. Right kidney biopsy.  \n5. Placement of a 4.5 mm × 26 mm double‑J ureteral stent.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** Sedation.  \n\n**Specimens collected:**  \n- Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity.  \n- Urine from the right kidney pelvis for cytology.  \n- Biopsies from the upper pole of the right kidney.  \n\n**Indication:**  \nA 74‑year‑old man first came to the office because he had blood in his urine. He was later taken to the hospital for other medical problems and still had blood in his urine. A CT scan showed an abnormal right kidney, so doctors decided he would benefit from a cystoscope examination.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter the patient gave consent, he was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. He received IV sedation and was positioned on his back with legs apart (dorsal lithotomy). The area was cleaned and covered in the usual way.  \n\nA #21 French cystoscope was inserted through the urethra into the bladder. The doctors noted that the patient has a mild enlargement of the prostate, but it was not blocking urine flow. The bladder lining showed some small bumps (tuberculation) but no masses or other problems.  \n\nThey then focused on the opening of the right ureter. A catheter was inserted into the right ureter, and a retrograde pyelogram was performed. The upper part of the right kidney’s collecting system was not seen. A guidewire was passed through the catheter, the catheter was removed, and the bladder was drained.  \n\nA rigid ureteroscope was then inserted into the bladder and guided into the right ureter with the help of a second guidewire. The scope was advanced to just below the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) and no obvious problems were seen. The scope was removed, and an Amplatz wire was passed up into the kidney’s collecting system.  \n\nA dilating sheath was then placed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under X‑ray guidance. The sheath was removed, and a flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter. The scope reached the UPJ, where the doctors found a blockage. They passed a wire through the scope, removed the scope, and then used a balloon dilator over the wire to widen the UPJ.  \n\nAfter dilation, the cystoscope was re‑inserted into the right ureter and successfully entered the kidney’s collecting system. They saw a papillary mass in the upper part of the collecting system. Biopsy forceps were passed through the scope, and two tissue samples were taken from the mass.  \n\nThe guidewire was left in place, the scope was removed, and the cystoscope was re‑inserted into the bladder. A 26 mm × 4.5 mm ureteral stent was placed over the wire into the right kidney pelvis under X‑ray and cystoscopic guidance. The stent was seen clearly in the kidney and bladder.  \n\nThe bladder was drained, the cystoscope was removed, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He was sent to recovery and then back to his room.  \n\nThe doctors discussed with his primary physician that he will probably need a kidney removal (nephrectomy). He will have an echocardiogram tomorrow, and if he is stable, a nephrectomy may be scheduled for Wednesday."
