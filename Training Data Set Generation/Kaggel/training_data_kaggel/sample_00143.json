  "medical": "PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Inguinal herniorrhaphy. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A standard inguinal incision was made and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel, and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle. This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery. The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures. The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery. Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature. The sac was excised and went to Pathology. The ends of the suture were then cut and the stump retracted back into the abdomen. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped and draped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing consisting of a 2 x 2 and OpSite was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Inguinal hernia repair. PROCEDURE: After the patient gave permission, she was taken to the operating room and laid on her back on the table. She was put under general anesthesia through a breathing tube with no problems. The area was cleaned and covered in the usual sterile way. A normal incision was made in the groin and the surgeon cut down to the outer layer of the abdominal wall using scissors and a small electric cautery device. The outer layer was cleared of any stuck tissue, and the outer ring of the groin was identified. The outer layer was cut open with a scalpel, and the cut was extended to the outer ring using scissors. Once the groin canal was exposed, the surgeon gently separated the spermatic cord from the canal, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord near the pubic bone. The drain was used to hold the cord in place when needed. Any muscle stuck to the cord was freed with the cautery. The cord was then examined with sharp and blunt tools, and the hernia sac was found in front of the cord. The sac was freed from the cord with blunt tools and cautery. When the surgeon reached the fat layer inside the abdomen, the dissection stopped and the sac was tied off with a 2‑0 silk suture at that level. The sac was removed and sent to pathology. The suture ends were cut and the remaining piece was pushed back into the abdomen. The Penrose drain was taken out. The wound was washed with sterile salt water, and bleeding was stopped with cautery. The outer layer incision was closed with a 3‑0 Vicryl stitch in a running pattern, restoring the outer ring. The skin was closed with a 4‑0 Vicryl stitch under the skin. The skin was cleaned with benzoin, and Steri‑Strips were applied. A 2 × 2 dressing and OpSite were then put on. All instruments and sponges were counted correctly. The patient tolerated the surgery well, was taken off the breathing tube, and went to recovery in good, stable condition."
