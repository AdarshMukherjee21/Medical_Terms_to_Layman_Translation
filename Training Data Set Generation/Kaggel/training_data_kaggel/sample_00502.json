POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stenosing tenosynovitis first dorsal extensor compartment/de Quervain tendonitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Release of first dorsal extensor compartment. ASSISTANT: None. ANESTHESIA: Bier block. TOURNIQUET TIME: 30 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS: The above patient is a 47-year-old right hand dominant black female who has signs and symptomology of de Quervain's stenosing tenosynovitis. She was treated conservatively with steroid injections, splinting, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents without relief. She is presenting today for release of the first dorsal extensor compartment. She is aware of the risks, benefits, alternatives and has consented to this operation. PROCEDURE: The patient was given intravenous prophylactic antibiotics. She was taken to the operating suite under the auspices of Anesthesiology. She was given a left upper extremity bier block. Her left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the normal fashion with Betadine solution. Afterwards, a transverse incision was made over the extensor retinaculum of the first dorsal extensor compartment. Dissection was carried down through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue. The dorsal radial sensory branches were kept out of harm's way. They were retracted gently to the ulnar side of the wrist. The retinaculum was incised with a #15 scalpel blade in the longitudinal fashion and the retinaculum was released completely both proximally and distally. Both the extensor pollices brevis and abductor pollices longus tendons were identified. There was no pathology noted within the first dorsal extensor compartment. The wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery. The wound was infiltrated with _0.25% Marcaine solution and then closure performed with #6-0 nylon suture utilizing a horizontal mattress stitch. Sterile occlusive dressing was applied along with the thumb spica splint. The tourniquet was released and the patient was transported to the recovery area in stable and satisfactory condition.",

She tried steroid injections, splinting, and pain‑relief medications but did not get relief. She has decided to have surgery to release the first dorsal extensor compartment. She understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives and has signed the consent form.  \n\nPROCEDURE:  \nThe patient received a preventive antibiotic through an IV. She was taken to the operating room and given a Bier block on her left arm. The arm was cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes. A horizontal cut was made over the extensor retinaculum of the first dorsal compartment. The surgeon cut through the skin and the tissue beneath it, taking care to protect the small nerves on the back of the wrist. The nerves were gently moved to the side. The retinaculum was cut lengthwise with a #15 scalpel, fully releasing it from the top to the bottom. The two tendons in this compartment, the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus, were seen and were normal. The wound was washed, and bleeding was stopped with bipolar cautery. A local anesthetic (0.25% Marcaine) was injected into the wound. The incision was closed with a #6‑0 nylon suture using a horizontal mattress stitch. A sterile dressing and a thumb‑spica splint were applied. The tourniquet was released and the patient was moved to recovery in stable condition."
