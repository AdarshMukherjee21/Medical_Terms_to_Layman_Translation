  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lateral malleolus fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lateral malleolus fracture. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open reduction and internal fixation of left lateral malleolus. ANESTHESIA: General. TOURNIQUET TIME: 59 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Negligible. CLOSURE: 2-0 Vicryl and staples. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: This is a young gentleman with soccer injury to his left ankle and an x-ray showed displaced lateral malleolus fracture with widening of the mortise now for ORIF. The risks and perceivable complications of the surgeries were discussed with the patient via a translator as well as nonsurgical treatment options and this was scheduled emergently. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room where general anesthesia was successfully introduced. The right ankle was prepped and draped in standard fashion. The tourniquet was applied about the right upper thigh. An Esmarch tourniquet was used to exsanguinate the ankle. The tourniquet was insufflated to a pressure 325 mm for approximately 59 minutes. An approximately 6 inch longitudinal incision was made just over the lateral malleolus. Care was taken to spare overlying nerves and vessels. An elevator was used to expose the fracture. The fracture was freed of old hematoma and reduced with a reducing clamp. An interfragmentary cortical screw was placed of 28 mm with excellent purchase. The intraoperative image showed excellent reduction. A 5-hole semitubular plate was then contoured to the lateral malleolus and fixed with 3 cortical screws proximally and 2 cancellous screws distally. Excellent stability of fracture was achieved. Final fluoroscopy showed a reduction to be anatomic in 2 planes. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. Deep tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl. The skin was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and closed with staples. Dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure, was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Broken left ankle bone (lateral malleolus).  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as pre‑operative.  \n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Surgery to straighten and hold the broken bone in place (open reduction and internal fixation).  \n\nANESTHESIA: General (you were asleep).  \n\nTOURNIQUET TIME: 59 minutes (the tourniquet was on for this time).  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \n\nBLOOD LOSS: Negligible.  \n\nCLOSURE: The wound was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl stitches and staples.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: A young man had a soccer injury to his left ankle. X‑ray showed a displaced break in the lateral malleolus with the ankle joint widened, so surgery was needed. The risks and possible complications were explained to him with a translator, along with non‑surgical options, and the surgery was scheduled as an emergency.  \n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and put under general anesthesia. The right ankle (note: the text says right ankle, but the injury was left; we keep the original) was cleaned and covered. A tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh and an Esmarch band was used to remove blood from the ankle. The tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg for about 59 minutes.  \n\nA 6‑inch long cut was made just above the lateral malleolus, taking care not to damage nearby nerves or blood vessels. An elevator tool exposed the broken bone. Old blood clots were removed and the bone was straightened with a clamp. A 28‑mm cortical screw was inserted to hold the pieces together. X‑ray images during the operation showed the bone was well aligned.  \n\nA 5‑hole semitubular plate was shaped to fit the lateral malleolus and fixed with three cortical screws near the top and two cancellous screws near the bottom, giving the fracture strong stability. Final X‑ray confirmed the bone was properly aligned in two planes.  \n\nThe wound was washed thoroughly with normal saline. The deep tissue was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl stitches, the skin was brought together with 2‑0 Vicryl and staples, and a sterile dressing was applied.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the surgery, woke up, and was taken to recovery in stable condition."
