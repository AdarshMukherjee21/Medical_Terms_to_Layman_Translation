POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Recurrent intractable low back and left lower extremity pain with history of L4-L5 discectomy. 2. Epidural fibrosis with nerve root entrapment. OPERATION PERFORMED: Left L4-L5 transforaminal neuroplasty with nerve root decompression and lysis of adhesions followed by epidural steroid injection. ANESTHESIA: Local/IV sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. SUMMARY: The patient in the operating room, status post transforaminal epidurogram (see operative note for further details). Using AP and lateral fluoroscopic views to confirm the needle location the superior most being in the left L4 neural foramen and the inferior most in the left L5 neural foramen, 375 units of Wydase was injected through each needle. After two minutes, 3.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine and 80 mg of Depo-Medrol was injected through each needle. These needles were removed and the patient was discharged in stable condition.",

Scar tissue in the epidural space that is squeezing the nerve root.  \n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Same as above. 2. Same as above.  \n\nOPERATION PERFORMED: A left L4‑L5 transforaminal neuroplasty was done to relieve pressure on the nerve root and break up scar tissue, followed by an epidural steroid injection.  \n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with IV sedation.  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \n\nSUMMARY: The patient was in the operating room after a transforaminal epidurogram (see the operative note for details). Using AP and lateral X‑ray views, the surgeon confirmed the needle was in the left L4 neural foramen at the top and the left L5 neural foramen at the bottom. 375 units of Wydase were injected through each needle. After two minutes, 3.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine and 80 mg of Depo‑Medrol were injected through each needle. The needles were removed and the patient was sent home in stable condition."
