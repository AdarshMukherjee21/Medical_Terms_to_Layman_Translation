  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cecal polyp. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cecal polyp. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic resection of cecal polyp. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General oral endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE: After adequate general anesthesia was administered the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically. Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the right upper quadrant where a small incision was made. Blunt dissection was carried down to the fascia which was grasped with Kocher clamps. A bladed 11-mm port was inserted without difficulty. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained using C02. Under direct vision 2 additional, non-bladed, 11-mm trocars were placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the right lower quadrant. There was some adhesion noted to the anterior midline which was taken down using the harmonic scalpel. The cecum was visualized and found to have tattoo located almost opposite the ileocecal valve. This was in what appeared to be an appropriate location for removal of this using the Endo GIA stapler without impinging on the ileocecal valve or the appendiceal orifice. The appendix was somewhat retrocecal in position but otherwise looked normal. The patient was also found to have ink marks in the peritoneal cavity diffusely indicating possible extravasation of dye. There was enough however in the wall to identify the location of the polyp. The lesion was grasped with a Babcock clamp and an Endo GIA stapler used to fire across this transversely. The specimen was then removed through the 12-mm port and examined on the back table. The lateral margin was found to be closely involved with the specimen so I did not feel that it was clear. I therefore lifted the lateral apex of the previous staple line and created a new staple line extending more laterally around the colon. This new staple line was then opened on the back table and examined. There was some residual polypoid material noted but the margins this time appeared to be clear. The peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with antibiotic solution. There were a few small areas of bleeding along the staple line which were treated with pinpoint electrocautery. The trocars were removed under direct vision. No bleeding was noted. The bladed trocar site was closed using a figure-of-eight O Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were closed with running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures. Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed followed by sterile Tegaderm dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.",

A local anesthetic was injected into the right upper abdomen where a small cut was made. The surgeon cut gently down to the muscle layer and used clamps to hold it. A 11‑mm surgical port was inserted easily. The abdomen was inflated with carbon dioxide. Two more 11‑mm ports were placed, one in the left lower abdomen and one in the right lower abdomen, all under direct vision.  \n\nSome scar tissue was found along the front midline and was cut away with a harmonic scalpel. The cecum (the first part of the large intestine) was seen, and a small ink mark was found near the ileocecal valve. This was a good spot to remove the polyp without touching the valve or the opening of the appendix. The appendix was a bit behind the cecum but looked normal. Ink was also seen scattered in the abdominal cavity, showing that dye had leaked out, but enough ink was still in the wall to locate the polyp.  \n\nThe polyp was grabbed with a clamp and a stapling device (Endo GIA) was used to cut across it. The piece was taken out through the 12‑mm port and examined. The side edge of the cut was close to the polyp, so the surgeon made a new, wider staple line further out on the colon. The new cut was checked and a small amount of polyp tissue was still left, but the edges now looked clear.  \n\nThe abdominal cavity was washed with an antibiotic solution. A few tiny bleeding spots along the staple line were sealed with a fine electric cautery. The ports were removed while watching the inside of the abdomen. No bleeding was seen. The main port site was closed with a figure‑of‑eight stitch using Vicryl. All skin cuts were closed with a running stitch of 4‑0 Monocryl under the skin. Mastisol and Steri‑Strips were applied, then a sterile Tegaderm dressing.  \n\nThe patient had a smooth operation with no complications."
