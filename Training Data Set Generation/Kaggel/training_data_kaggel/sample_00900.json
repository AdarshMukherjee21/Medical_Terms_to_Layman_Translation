  "medical": "The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on operating table in supine position. After adequate general endotracheal intubation, the patient underwent general anesthesia. The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A subumbilical skin incision was made. The Veress needle was inserted, and the patient's abdominal cavity was insufflated with moderate pressure all times. A subumbilical trocar was inserted. The camera was inserted in the panoramic view. The abdomen demonstrated some inflammation around the gallbladder. A 10-mm midepigastric trocar was inserted. A. 2 mm and 5 mm trocars were inserted. The most lateral trocar grasping forceps was inserted and grasped the fundus of the gallbladder and placed in tension at liver edge. Using the dissector, the cystic duct was identified and double Hemoclips were invited well away from the cystic-common duct junction. The cystic artery was identified and double Hemoclips applied. The gallbladder was taken down from the liver bed using Endoshears and electrocautery. Hemostasis was obtained. The gallbladder was removed from the midepigastric trocar site without difficulty. The trocars were removed and the skin incisions were reapproximated using 4-0 Monocryl. Steri-Strips and sterile dressing were placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "The patient was taken to the operating room and laid flat on the table. After the doctor put a breathing tube into the windpipe and gave general anesthesia, the surgeon cleaned and covered the belly in a sterile way. A small cut was made just below the belly button. A Veress needle was used to create a small amount of gas in the belly so the surgeon could see inside. A trocar (a tube) was then inserted through that cut. A camera was put in to give a wide view. The surgeon saw some inflammation around the gallbladder. Another 10‑mm trocar was placed in the upper middle belly. Two more small (2‑mm and 5‑mm) trocars were added. The outermost trocar was used to grab the top part of the gallbladder and pull it toward the liver edge. With a dissector, the surgeon found the cystic duct and put two Hemoclips on it, far from where it meets the main bile duct. The cystic artery was found and also clipped with two Hemoclips. The gallbladder was cut away from the liver using Endoshears and a small electric cautery. Bleeding was stopped. The gallbladder was removed through the 10‑mm trocar without any trouble. All the trocars were taken out and the small cuts were stitched together with 4‑0 Monocryl. Steri‑Strips and a sterile dressing were applied. The patient had no problems during the surgery and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
