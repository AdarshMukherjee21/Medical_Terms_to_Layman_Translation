  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right both bone forearm refracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right both bone forearm refracture. PROCEDURE: Closed reduction and pinning of the right ulna with placement of a long-arm cast. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine plain. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. HARDWARE: Hardware was 0.79 K-wire. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 5-year-old male who sustained refracture of his right forearm on 12/05/2007. The patient was seen in the emergency room. The patient had a complete fracture of both bones with shortening bayonet apposition. Treatment options were offered to the family including casting versus closed reduction and pinning. The parents opted for the latter. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. Risks of surgery included risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, cast tightness. All questions were answered, and the parents agreed to the above plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. A small incision was made at the tip of the olecranon. Initially, a 1.11 guidewire was placed, but this was noted to be too wide for this canal. This was changed for a 0.79 K-wire. This was driven up to the fracture site. The fracture was manually reduced and then the K-wire passed through the distal segment. This demonstrated adequate fixation and reduction of both bones. The pin was then cut short. The fracture site and pin site was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine. The incision was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. The wounds were cleaned and dried. Dressed with Xeroform, 4 x 4. The patient was then placed in a well-moulded long-arm cast. He tolerated the procedure well. He was subsequently taken to Recovery in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be maintain current pin, and long-arm cast for 4 weeks at which time he will return for cast removal. X-rays of the right forearm will be taken. The patient may need additional mobilization time. Once the fracture has healed, we will take the pin out, usually at the earliest 3 to 4 months. Intraoperative findings were relayed to the parents. All questions were answered.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑surgery diagnosis:** The boy’s right forearm had broken again in both bones.  \n**After surgery diagnosis:** Same – a repeat break in both forearm bones.  \n\n**What was done:** The broken bones were straightened without opening the arm and a metal pin was inserted into the ulna. A long‑arm cast was then applied.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** The boy was put under general anesthesia (he was asleep). A local anesthetic (10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine) was also used.  \n\n**Complications:** None during the operation.  \n**Drains:** None.  \n**Specimens:** None taken.  \n**Hardware:** A 0.79 mm K‑wire was used.  \n\n**History and physical exam:**  \nThe patient is a 5‑year‑old boy who broke his right forearm again on December 5, 2007. He was seen in the emergency room. The break was complete in both bones and the ends were slightly overlapped. The family was given two treatment options: a cast or a closed reduction with pinning. They chose the pinning. The risks of surgery (anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in feeling or movement, possible hardware failure, need to remove the hardware later, and cast tightness) were explained and the parents agreed.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. He was given general anesthesia and a pre‑operative antibiotic (Ancef). The right arm was cleaned and covered. A small cut was made near the elbow tip. A 1.11 mm guidewire was first tried but was too large, so a 0.79 mm K‑wire was used instead. The wire was guided to the break, the bones were straightened by hand, and the wire was passed through the lower bone segment. This held the bones in the correct position. The wire was cut short. The break and wire site were numbed with 0.25% Marcaine. The small cut was closed with 4‑0 Monocryl stitches. The wound was cleaned, dried, and covered with Xeroform dressing (4 × 4). A well‑molded long‑arm cast was then applied. The boy tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in stable condition.  \n\n**Post‑surgery plan:**  \nThe boy will keep the pin and cast for about 4 weeks, then return for cast removal. X‑rays of the right forearm will be taken. He may need more time to move the arm. Once the fracture has healed, the pin will be removed, usually between 3 and 4 months. The parents were informed of the findings and all their questions were answered."
