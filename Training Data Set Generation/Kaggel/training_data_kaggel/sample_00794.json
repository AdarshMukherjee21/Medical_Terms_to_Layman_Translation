  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Follow up adenomas. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Two colon polyps, removed. 2. Small internal hemorrhoids. 3. Otherwise normal examination of cecum. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 150 mcg and Versed 7 mg slow IV push. INDICATIONS: This is a 60-year-old white female with a history of adenomas. She does have irregular bowel habits. FINDINGS: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. There was a 4 mm descending colon polyp, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle one. There was a 10 mm pale, flat polyp in the distal rectum, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle 2. There were small internal hemorrhoids. The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. IMPRESSION: 1. Two colon polyps, removed. 2. Small internal hemorrhoids. 3. Otherwise normal examination to cecum. PLAN: I will await the results of the colon polyp histology. The patient was told the importance of daily fiber.",

Small internal hemorrhoids.  \n3. The rest of the colon looked normal.  \n\n**Medications given:** Fentanyl 150 mcg and Versed 7 mg, slowly injected into a vein.  \n\n**Why the procedure was done:** A 60‑year‑old white woman with a history of colon polyps and irregular bowel movements.  \n\n**What happened during the procedure:**  \n- The patient lay on her left side.  \n- The doctor gave the medications.  \n- A flexible tube (colonoscope) was inserted and guided to the cecum, the first part of the large intestine, by looking for the ileocecal valve, the opening of the appendix, and a blind pouch.  \n- The scope was slowly pulled back while the doctor carefully examined the lining of the colon, including a special backward view of the rectum.  \n- A 4 mm polyp was found in the descending colon and removed with large forceps; it was placed in a bottle for lab testing.  \n- A 10 mm flat, pale polyp was found in the lower rectum and also removed with large forceps; it was put in a second bottle for lab testing.  \n- Small internal hemorrhoids were seen.  \n- The rest of the colon up to the cecum was normal.  \n- The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n1. Two colon polyps removed.  \n2. Small internal hemorrhoids.  \n3. The rest of the colon was normal.  \n\n**Next steps:** Wait for the lab results of the removed polyps. The patient was advised to eat more fiber every day."
