  "medical": "EXAM: Two views of the pelvis. HISTORY: This is a patient post-surgery, 2-1/2 months. The patient has a history of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) bilaterally. TECHNIQUE: Frontal and lateral views of the hip and pelvis were evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated MM/DD/YYYY. Lateral view of the right hip was evaluated. FINDINGS: Frontal view of the pelvis and a lateral view of the right hip were evaluated and correlated with the patient's most recent priors dated MM/DD/YYYY. Current films reveal stable appearing post-surgical changes. Again demonstrated is a single intramedullary screw across the left femoral neck and head. There are 2 intramedullary screws through the greater trochanter of the right femur. There is a lucency along the previous screw track extending into the right femoral head and neck. There has been interval removal of cutaneous staples and/or surgical clips. These were previously seen along the lateral aspect of the right hip joint. Deformity related to the previously described slipped capital femoral epiphysis is again seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable-appearing right hip joint status-post pinning. 2. Interval removal of skin staples as described above.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Two X‑ray views of the pelvis.  \nHISTORY: The patient had surgery 2½ months ago. The patient has had slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) on both hips.  \n\nTECHNIQUE: We took front (frontal) and side (lateral) X‑rays of the hips and pelvis and compared them with the previous film from MM/DD/YYYY. The side view of the right hip was also examined.  \n\nFINDINGS: The front view of the pelvis and the side view of the right hip were compared with the patient’s most recent prior X‑ray from MM/DD/YYYY. The new images show that the surgical changes look stable. A single screw runs inside the left femoral neck and head. Two screws run inside the greater trochanter of the right femur. There is a clear line along the old screw path that extends into the right femoral head and neck. Skin staples and/or surgical clips that were previously seen on the outside of the right hip joint have been removed. The shape change caused by the earlier SCFE is still visible.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. The right hip looks stable after pinning.  \n2. Skin staples were removed as described."
