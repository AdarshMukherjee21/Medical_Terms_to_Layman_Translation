  "medical": "2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM Multiple views of the heart and great vessels reveal normal intracardiac and great vessel relationships. Cardiac function is normal. There is no significant chamber enlargement or hypertrophy. There is no pericardial effusion or vegetations seen. Doppler interrogation, including color flow imaging, reveals systemic venous return to the right atrium with normal tricuspid inflow. Pulmonary outflow is normal at the valve. Pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium. The interatrial septum is intact. Mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are normal. The aortic valve is trileaflet. The coronary arteries appear to be normal in their origins. The aortic arch is left-sided and patent with normal descending aorta pulsatility.",
  "layman": "2‑D ECHOCARDIOGRAM\n\nThe heart and its main blood vessels look normal. The heart’s pumping ability is fine. The chambers are the right size and not thickened. There is no fluid around the heart or any abnormal growths. Blood flow from the body to the right atrium and through the tricuspid valve is normal. Blood leaves the heart through the pulmonary valve normally. Blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium normally. The wall between the two atria is intact. Blood flows through the mitral valve and the ascending aorta normally. The aortic valve has three leaflets. The coronary arteries start normally. The aortic arch is on the left side and open, and the descending aorta shows normal blood flow."
