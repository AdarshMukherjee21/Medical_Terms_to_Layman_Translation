The slices were 5 mm thick, and we also took 2.5 mm slices without any contrast dye. We made side‑view and front‑view images from the data.  \n\nDISCUSSION: Nothing urgent was seen inside the skull. There is no swelling of the brain, no shift of the brain’s center, no large growths or abnormal fluid pockets. The brain’s outer layer looks normal. The sinuses are clear. No bone problems were found. Dr. Xyz gave a preliminary report to the emergency room when the scan finished.  \n\nIMPRESSION: No urgent problems inside the skull."
