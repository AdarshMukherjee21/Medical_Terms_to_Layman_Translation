OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Subcutaneous transposition of the right ulnar nerve. ANESTHESIA: General TOURNIQUET TIME: Forty minutes. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated. The tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg. An incision was made on the medial aspect of the arm and carried out anterior to the medial epicondyle across the antecubital fossa. Using blunt dissection, branches of the medial brachial, and antebrachial cutaneous nerves were dissected and retracted out of the operative field. Anterior flap was further dissected across the medial epicondyle anterior to the antebrachial fasciae. The medial intermuscular septum was then dissected from the arcade of Struthers to its insertion on the medial epicondyle and excised in toto. Care was taken to protect the underlying ulnar nerve. Ulnar nerve was then dissected from surrounding soft tissue with its vascular leash from the proximal incision to the level of the cubital tunnel. At the cubital tunnel, the interval between the heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon were then incised longitudinally along the antebrachial fasciae. The ulnar nerve was then further dissected into the cubital tunnel to the level of the first motor branch. The nerve was freed from surrounding soft tissue with care taken to protect motor branch. The ulnar nerve was then transposed anterior to the medial epicondyle. The elbow was put through full range of motion. No compression points or acute angles were identified. An Eaton sling was then fashioned from antebrachial fasciae and sutured to the anterior skin flap, using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Again, the elbow was put through full motion and no compression points were identified. The skin was allowed to resume its normal anatomical position, and closed in a layered fashion using 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous stitches and running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Sterile dressing were then applied to all wounds, over the sterile dressing a sugar-tong splint with the hand in sage position was then applied. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",

Right cubital tunnel syndrome.  \n\n**Operation performed:**  \nSubcutaneous transposition of the right ulnar nerve.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** General.  \n\n**Tourniquet time:** 40 minutes.  \n\n**Procedure description:**  \nThe patient was given general anesthesia. The arm was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Blood was removed from the arm and a tourniquet was set to 290 mm Hg.  \n\nA small cut was made on the inner side of the arm, just above the elbow, and extended across the front of the elbow. Using gentle, blunt tools, the small nerves that run along the inner arm were carefully moved out of the way. The skin and tissue over the inner elbow were further cut and moved aside. The muscle wall that separates the inner arm from the inner forearm was cut from the point where it attaches to the inner elbow and removed entirely, taking care not to damage the ulnar nerve underneath.  \n\nThe ulnar nerve was freed from the surrounding tissue and its blood supply was followed from the first cut to the level of the elbow tunnel. At the elbow tunnel, the space between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle was cut lengthwise along the forearm fascia. The nerve was then moved into the tunnel up to the first motor branch, and all surrounding tissue was removed while protecting that branch.  \n\nThe nerve was moved to the front of the inner elbow. The elbow was moved through its full range of motion; no tight spots or sharp angles were found. A sling was made from the forearm fascia and sewn to the skin flap with 3‑0 Vicryl stitches. The elbow was moved again and no compression points were seen.  \n\nThe skin was returned to its normal position and closed in layers: subcutaneous stitches with 3‑0 Vicryl and a running subcuticular stitch with 3‑0 Prolene. Sterile dressings were applied, and over them a sugar‑tong splint was placed with the hand in a neutral position. The tourniquet was released. The patient woke up from anesthesia and was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the surgery well."
