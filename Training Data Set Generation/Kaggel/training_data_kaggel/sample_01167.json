  "medical": "PROCEDURES: 1. Right frontal craniotomy with resection of right medial frontal brain tumor. 2. Stereotactic image-guided neuronavigation for resection of tumor. 3. Microdissection and micro-magnification for resection of brain tumor. ANESTHESIA: General via endotracheal tube. INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of left-sided weakness and headaches. She has a previous history of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, treated 2 years ago. An MRI was obtained which showed a large enhancing mass in the medial right frontal lobe consistent with a metastatic lesion or possible primary brain tumor. After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room for surgery. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift, probable metastatic lung carcinoma. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was wheeled into the operating room and satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained via endotracheal tube. She was positioned on the operating room table in the Sugita frame with the head secured. Using the preoperative image-guided MRI, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor. We marked external landmarks. Then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area. This area was then sterilely prepped and draped. Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted. A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline. This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips. The skin flap was retracted medially. Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected. One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap. Hemostasis was obtained. Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was. The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus. We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain. The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor. We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins. Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor. Subsequently, we entered the tumor. The tumor itself was extremely hard. Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma. We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins. Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case. We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally. Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor. Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely. In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out. We resected the entire tumor. Neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained. Hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and Gelfoam. We also lined the cavity with Surgicel. The cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained. The dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 Nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion. Surgicel was placed over the dural closure. The bone flap was repositioned and held in place using CranioFIX cranial fixators. The galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples. The wound was dressed. The patient was returned to the intensive care unit. She was awake and moving extremities well. No apparent complications were noted. Needle and sponge counts were listed as correct at the end of the procedure. Estimated intraoperative blood loss was approximately 150 mL and none was replaced.",
  "layman": "**Procedures:**  \n1. A right frontal craniotomy to remove a tumor in the right medial frontal part of the brain.  \n2. Use of stereotactic image‑guided neuronavigation to locate the tumor.  \n3. Use of a microscope and micro‑dissection tools to remove the tumor.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia delivered through an endotracheal tube.\n\n**Indications for the procedure:**  \nThe patient is a 71‑year‑old woman who has had left‑side weakness and headaches. She was treated for non‑small cell lung cancer two years ago. An MRI showed a large, bright‑appearing mass in the right medial frontal lobe that could be a metastasis from her lung cancer or a primary brain tumor. After she gave informed consent, she was taken to the operating room.\n\n**Pre‑operative diagnosis:**  \nA tumor in the right medial frontal lobe with swelling around it, pushing the brain to the left.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:**  \nSame tumor with swelling and brain shift; most likely a metastasis from lung cancer.\n\n**Description of the procedure:**  \nThe patient was wheeled into the operating room and put under general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube. She was positioned on the table with a Sugita frame to keep her head steady. Using the pre‑operative MRI, we matched the image to the patient’s skull and used stereotactic navigation to find the tumor. We marked external landmarks, shaved the right medial frontal area, and cleaned and draped it. We monitored evoked potentials and sensory potentials throughout, with no changes.\n\nA horseshoe‑shaped skin flap was made on the right side and moved to the midline. We opened it and stopped bleeding with Raney clips. The flap was pulled back toward the middle. Two small holes (burr holes) were drilled and connected. One hole was over the sinus; we removed a rectangular piece of bone. Bleeding was controlled.\n\nWith neuronavigation, we located the tumor. The dura (outer brain covering) was opened with a horseshoe flap over the medial sinus. We pulled it back and saw the brain surface, which was discolored and irritated by the tumor. Using the navigation, we mapped the tumor’s edges. We used a bipolar cautery to seal a thin layer of brain over the tumor, then entered the tumor. The tumor was very hard. We took samples for frozen section, which showed probable metastatic cancer. We carefully dissected around the tumor’s edges. Under the microscope, we used micro‑dissection tools to create planes around the tumor in all directions. We then used a Cavitron ultrasonic aspirator to core out the center of the tumor, collapsing it and removing it completely. The entire tumor was removed. Neuronavigation confirmed no visible tumor remained. We stopped bleeding with bipolar cautery and Gelfoam, and lined the cavity with Surgicel. The cavity was dry and bleeding was well controlled.\n\nThe dura was closed with multiple interrupted 4‑0 Nurolon sutures to make a watertight seal, and Surgicel was placed over the closure. The bone flap was put back and secured with CranioFIX cranial fixators. The galea (skin layer) was re‑approximated and the skin was closed with staples. The wound was dressed.\n\nThe patient was taken to the intensive care unit. She was awake and moving all limbs well. No complications were noted. The counts of needles and sponges were correct. Estimated blood loss during the operation was about 150 mL, and no blood was replaced."
