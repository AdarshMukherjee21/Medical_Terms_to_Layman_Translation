  "medical": "EXAM:MRI SPINAL CORD CERVICAL WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:Right arm pain, numbness and tingling. FINDINGS: Vertebral alignment and bone marrow signal characteristics are unremarkable. The C2-3 and C3-4 disk levels appear unremarkable. At C4-5, broad based disk/osteophyte contacts the ventral surface of the spinal cord and may mildly indent the cord contour. A discrete cord signal abnormality is not identified. There may also be some narrowing of the neuroforamina at this level. At C5-6, central disk-osteophyte contacts and mildly impresses on the ventral cord contour. Distinct neuroforaminal narrowing is not evident. At C6-7, mild diffuse disk-osteophyte impresses on the ventral thecal sac and contacts the ventral cord surface. Distinct cord compression is not evident. There may be mild narrowing of the neuroforamina at his level. A specific abnormality is not identified at the C7-T1 level. IMPRESSION: Disk/osteophyte at C4-5 through C6-7 with contact and may mildly indent the ventral cord contour at these levels. Some possible neuroforaminal narrowing is also noted at levels as stated above.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the cervical (neck) spinal cord without contrast  \nCLINICAL: Right arm pain, numbness, and tingling  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n- The bones and bone marrow look normal.  \n- The discs at C2‑3 and C3‑4 are normal.  \n- At C4‑5, a broad disc and bone spur touch the front of the spinal cord and may slightly press on it. No clear cord damage is seen. The openings where nerves exit (neuroforamina) may be a little narrowed.  \n- At C5‑6, a disc and bone spur touch the front of the cord and slightly press on it. The nerve openings are not noticeably narrowed.  \n- At C6‑7, a mild disc and bone spur touch the front of the protective sac around the cord and contact the front of the cord. No obvious cord compression is seen. The nerve openings may be mildly narrowed.  \n- At C7‑T1, nothing abnormal is seen.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \nDisc and bone spur changes at C4‑5 through C6‑7 touch the front of the spinal cord and may slightly press on it. Possible narrowing of the nerve openings is also noted at these levels."
