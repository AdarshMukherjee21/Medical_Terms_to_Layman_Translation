  "medical": "EXAM: Barium enema. CLINICAL HISTORY: A 4-year-old male with a history of encopresis and constipation. TECHNIQUE: A single frontal scout radiograph of the abdomen was performed. A rectal tube was inserted in usual sterile fashion, and retrograde instillation of barium contrast was followed via spot fluoroscopic images. A post-evacuation overhead radiograph of the abdomen was performed. FINDINGS: The scout radiograph demonstrates a nonobstructive gastrointestinal pattern. There are no suspicious calcifications seen or evidence of gross free intraperitoneal air. The visualized lung bases and osseous structures are within normal limits. The rectum and colon is of normal caliber throughout its course. There is no evidence of obstruction, as contrast is seen to flow without difficulty into the right colon and cecum. A small amount of contrast is seen to opacify small bowel loops on the post-evacuation image. There is also opacification of a normal-appearing appendix documented. IMPRESSION: Normal barium enema.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Barium enema.  \nCLINICAL HISTORY: A 4‑year‑old boy who has been having constipation and occasional soiling.  \n\nTECHNIQUE: A quick front‑view X‑ray of the belly was taken. A tube was gently put into the rectum, and barium liquid was pushed back into the colon while a few quick X‑ray images were taken. After the barium was drained, another X‑ray from above was taken.  \n\nFINDINGS: The initial X‑ray shows a normal looking gut with no blockages. No unusual stones or free air in the belly were seen. The lower lungs and bones look normal. The rectum and colon are the right size all the way through. The barium moved easily into the right side of the colon and the cecum, showing no blockage. A small amount of barium also filled some small bowel loops on the second X‑ray. The appendix also filled with barium and looks normal.  \n\nIMPRESSION: The barium enema is normal."
