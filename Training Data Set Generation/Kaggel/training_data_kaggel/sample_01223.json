  "medical": "EXAM: Bilateral diagnostic mammogram and right breast ultrasound. History of palpable abnormality at 10 o'clock in the right breast. Family history of a sister with breast cancer at age 43. TECHNIQUE: CC and MLO views of both breasts were obtained. Spot compression views of the palpable area were also obtained. Right breast ultrasound was performed. Comparison is made with mm/dd/yy. FINDINGS: The breast parenchymal pattern is stable with heterogeneous scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue. No new mass or architectural distortion is evident. Asymmetric density in the upper outer posterior left breast and a nodule in the upper outer right breast are unchanged. There is no suspicious cluster of microcalcifications. Directed ultrasonography of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast revealed no cystic or hypoechoic solid mass. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable mammographic appearance from mm/dd/yy. 2. No sonographic evidence of a mass at 10 o'clock in the right breast to correspond to the palpable abnormality. The need for further assessment of a palpable abnormality should be determined clinically. BIRADS Classification 2 - Benign",
  "layman": "EXAM: We did a mammogram of both breasts and an ultrasound of the right breast. The patient says she feels a lump at the 10 o’clock position on the right side. Her sister had breast cancer at age 43.\n\nTECHNIQUE: We took standard craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views of both breasts. We also took extra images of the area where the lump is felt. We performed an ultrasound of the right breast. The images were compared with those taken on mm/dd/yy.\n\nFINDINGS: The overall look of the breast tissue is the same as before, with mixed fibrous and glandular areas. No new lump or distortion of the breast shape is seen. The uneven density in the upper outer back part of the left breast and a small nodule in the upper outer part of the right breast are unchanged. There are no suspicious clusters of tiny calcium deposits. The ultrasound of the upper outer part of the right breast did not show any cysts or solid masses.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. The mammogram looks the same as it did on mm/dd/yy.\n2. The ultrasound does not show a mass at the 10 o’clock spot on the right breast that matches the lump the patient feels. Whether more tests are needed for the lump should be decided by the doctor.\nBIRADS Classification 2 – Benign."
