  "medical": "CC: Memory difficulty. HX: This 64 y/o RHM had had difficulty remembering names, phone numbers and events for 12 months prior to presentation, on 2/28/95. This had been called to his attention by the clerical staff at his parish--he was a Catholic priest. He had had no professional or social faux pas or mishaps due to his memory. He could not tell whether his problem was becoming worse, so he brought himself to the Neurology clinic on his own referral. MEDS: None. PMH: 1)appendectomy, 2)tonsillectomy, 3)childhood pneumonia, 4)allergy to sulfa drugs. FHX: Both parents experienced memory problems in their ninth decades, but not earlier. 5 siblings have had no memory trouble. There are no neurological illnesses in his family. SHX: Catholic priest. Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP131/74, HR78, RR12, 36.9C, Wt. 77kg, Ht. 178cm. MS: A&O to person, place and time. 29/30 on MMSE; 2/3 recall at 5 minutes. 2/10 word recall at 10 minutes. Unable to remember the name of the President (Clinton). 23words/60 sec on Category fluency testing (normal). Mild visual constructive deficit. The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable and there were no extrapyramidal signs or primitive reflexes noted. COURSE: TSH 5.1, T4 7.9, RPR non-reactive. Neuropsychological evaluation, 3/6/95, revealed: 1)well preserved intellectual functioning and orientation, 2) significant deficits in verbal and visual memory, proper naming, category fluency and working memory, 3)performances which were below expectations on tests of speed of reading, visual scanning, visual construction and clock drawing, 4)limited insight into the scope and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction. The findings indicated multiple areas of cerebral dysfunction. With the exception of the patient's report of minimal occupational dysfunction ( which may reflect poor insight), the clinical picture is consistent with a progressive dementia syndrome such as Alzheimer's disease. MRI brain, 3/6/95, showed mild generalized atrophy, more severe in the occipital-parietal regions. In 4/96, his performance on repeat neuropsychological evaluation was relatively stable. His verbal learning and delayed recognition were within normal limits, whereas delayed recall was &quot;moderately severely&quot; impaired. Immediate and delayed visual memory were slightly below expectations. Temporal orientation and expressive language skills were below expectation, especially in word retrieval. These findings were suggestive of particular, but not exclusive, involvement of the temporal lobes. On 9/30/96, he was evaluated for a 5 minute spell of visual loss, OU. The episode occurred on Friday, 9/27/96, in the morning while sitting at his desk doing paperwork. He suddenly felt that his gaze was pulled toward a pile of letters; then a &quot;curtain&quot; came down over both visual fields, like &quot;everything was in the shade.&quot; During the episode he felt fully alert and aware of his surroundings. He concurrently heard a &quot;grating sound&quot; in his head. After the episode, he made several phone calls, during which he reportedly sounded confused, and perseverated about opening a bank account. He then drove to visit his sister in Muscatine, Iowa, without accident. He was reportedly &quot;normal&quot; when he reached her house. He was able to perform Mass over the weekend without any difficulty. Neurologic examination, 9/30/96, was notable for: 1)category fluency score of 18items/60 sec. 2)VFFTC and EOM were intact. There was no RAPD, INO, loss of visual acuity. Glucose 178 (elevated), ESR ,Lipid profile, GS, CBC with differential, Carotid duplex scan, EKG, and EEG were all normal. MRI brain, 9/30/96, was unchanged from previous, 3/6/95. On 1/3/97, he had a 30 second spell of lightheadedness without vertigo, but with balance difficulty, after picking up a box of books. The episode was felt due to orthostatic changes. 1/8/97 neuropsychological evaluation was stable and his MMSE score was 25/30 (with deficits in visual construction, orientation, and 2/3 recall at 1 minute). Category fluency score 23 items/60 sec. Neurologic exam was notable for graphesthesia in the left hand. In 2/97, he had episodes of anxiety, marked fluctuations in job performance and resigned his pastoral position. His neurologic exam was unchanged. An FDG-PET scan on 2/14/97 revealed decreased uptake in the right posterior temporal-parietal and lateral occipital regions.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nTrouble remembering things.\n\n**History**  \nA 64‑year‑old Roman Catholic priest had been having difficulty remembering names, phone numbers and events for about a year before he came to the clinic on February 28, 1995. The staff at his parish noticed the problem. He had not made any professional or social mistakes because of his memory, and he was not sure if it was getting worse, so he decided to see a neurologist on his own.\n\n**Medications**  \nNone.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \n- Appendectomy  \n- Tonsillectomy  \n- Childhood pneumonia  \n- Allergy to sulfa drugs\n\n**Family History**  \nBoth parents had memory problems when they were in their 90s, but not earlier. Five siblings had no memory problems. No family members had neurological diseases.\n\n**Social History**  \nHe is a Catholic priest. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.\n\n**Physical Exam**  \n- Blood pressure 131/74 mm Hg  \n- Heart rate 78 bpm  \n- Respirations 12/min  \n- Temperature 36.9 °C  \n- Weight 77 kg, Height 178 cm  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place and time  \n- Mini‑Mental State Examination (MMSE) 29/30  \n  - Remembered 2 of 3 items after 5 minutes  \n  - Remembered 2 of 10 words after 10 minutes  \n  - Could not name the current President (Clinton)  \n- Category‑fluency: 23 words in 60 seconds (normal)  \n- Mild visual‑construction deficit  \n- Rest of neurological exam normal; no abnormal movements or reflexes\n\n**Course of Illness**  \n\n| Date | Findings | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|\n| **March 6, 1995** | Neuropsychological evaluation | General intellect and orientation good; significant deficits in verbal & visual memory, naming, fluency, working memory; slower reading, scanning, construction, clock drawing; limited insight into cognitive problems. Suggests progressive dementia (Alzheimer’s‑type). |\n| | MRI | Mild overall brain shrinkage, worse in occipital‑parietal region. |\n| **April 1996** | Repeat neuropsychological test | Stable. Verbal learning & delayed recognition normal; delayed recall moderately to severely impaired. Immediate & delayed visual memory slightly below normal. Temporal‑lobe involvement suggested. |\n| **September 30, 1996** | Evaluation after 5‑minute visual‑loss episode | Episode occurred on September 27 while at desk. He felt his gaze pulled toward a pile of letters, a “curtain” fell over both visual fields, and he heard a “grating” sound. He was alert and aware. Afterward he made confused phone calls, kept talking about opening a bank account, then drove safely to his sister in Muscatine, Iowa, and performed Mass over the weekend without difficulty. |\n| | Neurological exam | Category‑fluency 18/60 seconds. Visual‑field testing & eye movements normal. No pupillary defect, no internuclear ophthalmoplegia, no loss of visual acuity. |\n| | Labs | Glucose 178 mg/dL (high). ESR, lipid profile, glucose, CBC, carotid duplex, ECG, EEG all normal. |\n| | MRI | Unchanged from March 1995. |\n| **January 3, 1997** | 30‑second light‑headedness episode | No vertigo, but balance difficulty after picking up a box of books. Likely orthostatic change. |\n| **January 8, 1997** | Neuropsychological evaluation | MMSE 25/30; deficits in visual construction, orientation, 2/3 recall after 1 minute. Category‑fluency 23/60 seconds. |\n| | Neurological exam | Able to feel touch on left hand (graphesthesia). |\n| **February 1997** | Episodes of anxiety, marked job‑performance changes, resignation from pastoral position | Neurological exam unchanged. |\n| | FDG‑PET (February 14, 1997) | Decreased activity in right posterior temporal‑parietal and lateral occipital regions. |\n\n**Summary**  \nThe patient shows progressive memory and cognitive decline consistent with a dementia syndrome such as Alzheimer’s disease. Imaging and neuropsychological testing indicate involvement of multiple brain regions, especially the temporal lobes. He has experienced brief visual‑loss episodes and light‑headedness, but these have not altered the overall neurological picture."
