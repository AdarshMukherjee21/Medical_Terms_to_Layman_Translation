  "medical": "EXAM: Nuclear medicine tumor localization, whole body. HISTORY: Status post subtotal thyroidectomy for thyroid carcinoma, histology not provided. FINDINGS: Following the oral administration of 4.3 mCi Iodine-131, whole body planar images were obtained in the anterior and posterior projections at 24, 48, and 72 hours. There is increased uptake in the left upper quadrant, which persists throughout the examination. There is a focus of increased activity in the right lower quadrant, which becomes readily apparent at 72 hours. Physiologic uptake in the liver, spleen, and transverse colon is noted. Physiologic urinary bladder uptake is also appreciated. There is low-grade uptake in the oropharyngeal region. IMPRESSION: Iodine-avid foci in the right lower quadrant and left upper quadrant medially suspicious for distant metastasis. Anatomical evaluation, i.e., CT is advised to determine if there are corresponding mesenteric lesions. Ultimately (provided that the original pathology of the thyroid tumor with iodine-avid) PET scanning may be necessary. No evidence of iodine added locoregional metastasis.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Whole‑body scan using nuclear medicine to find cancer spots.  \nHISTORY: The patient had part of the thyroid removed because of thyroid cancer; the exact tissue details are not known.  \n\nFINDINGS: After taking 4.3 mCi of Iodine‑131 by mouth, pictures of the whole body were taken from the front and back at 24, 48, and 72 hours.  \n- There is more iodine in the left upper part of the body, and this stays visible at all times.  \n- A spot of extra iodine shows up in the right lower part of the body, becoming clear at 72 hours.  \n- Normal iodine is seen in the liver, spleen, and middle part of the colon.  \n- The bladder also shows normal iodine.  \n- A small amount of iodine is seen in the throat area.  \n\nIMPRESSION: The iodine‑positive spots in the right lower and left upper areas look like possible distant cancer spread. A CT scan is recommended to see if there are matching tissue changes in the belly area. If the original thyroid cancer was iodine‑positive, a PET scan might also be needed. No iodine‑positive cancer was found near the original thyroid site."
