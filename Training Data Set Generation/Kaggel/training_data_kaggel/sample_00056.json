  "medical": "PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following a barium enema prep and lidocaine ointment to the rectal vault, perirectal inspection and rectal exam were normal. The Olympus video colonoscope then introduced into the rectum and passed by directed vision to the distal descending colon. Withdrawal notes an otherwise normal descending, rectosigmoid and rectum. Retroflexion noted no abnormality of the internal ring. No hemorrhoids were noted. Withdrawal from the patient terminated the procedure.",
  "layman": "After preparing the bowel with a barium enema and applying lidocaine ointment to the rectum, the doctor checked the area around the rectum and performed a rectal exam; everything looked normal. An Olympus video colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum and guided to the lower part of the descending colon. As the scope was pulled back, the descending colon, rectosigmoid, and rectum all appeared normal. When the scope was bent back (retroflexion), the internal opening looked normal. No hemorrhoids were seen. The procedure was finished when the scope was removed."
