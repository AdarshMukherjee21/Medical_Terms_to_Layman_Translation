PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Microscopic assisted lumbar laminotomy with discectomy at L5-S1 on the left. ANESTHESIA: General via endotracheal tube. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 50 cc. SPECIMENS: Disc that was not sent to the lab. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. SURGICAL PROGNOSIS: Remains guarded due to her ongoing pain condition and Tarlov cyst at the L5 nerve root distally. SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 51-year-old female who has had unrelenting low back pain that radiated down her left leg for the past several months. The symptoms were unrelieved by conservative modalities. The symptoms were interfering with all aspects of daily living and inability to perform any significant work endeavors. She is understanding the risks, benefits, potential complications, as well as all treatment alternatives. She wished to proceed with the aforementioned surgery due to her persistent symptoms. Informed consent was obtained. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to OR room #5 where she was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia. She was subsequently placed on the Jackson spinal table with the Wilson attachment in the prone position. Palpation did reveal the iliac crest and suspected L5-S1 interspace. Thereafter the lumbar spine was serially prepped and draped. A midline incision was carried over the spinal process of L5 to S1. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply. Electrocautery provided hemostasis. Electrocautery was then utilized to dissect through the subcutaneous tissues to the lumbar fascia. Lumbar fascia was identified and the decussation of fibers was identified at the L5-S1 interspace. On the left side, superior aspect dissection was carried out with the Cobb elevator and electrocautery. This revealed the interspace of suspect level of L5-S1 on the left. A Kocher clamp was placed between the spinous processes of the suspect level of L5-S1. X-ray did confirm the L5-S1 interval. Angled curet was utilized to detach the ligamentum flavum from its bony attachments at the superior edge of S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina. Meticulous dissection was undertaken and the ligamentum flavum was removed. Laminotomy was created with Kerrison rongeur, both proximally and distally. The microscope was positioned and the dura was inspected. A blunt Penfield elevator was then utilized to dissect and identify the L5-S1 nerve root on the left. It was noted to be tented over a disc extrusion. The nerve root was protected and medialized. It was retracted with a nerve root retractor. This did reveal a subligamentous disc herniation at approximately the L5-S1 disc space and neuroforaminal area. A #15 Bard-Parker blade was utilized to create an annulotomy. Medially, disc material was extruding through this annulotomy. Two tier rongeur was then utilized to grasp the disc material and the disc was removed from the interspace. Additional disc material was then removed, both to the right and left of the annulotomy. Up and downbiting pituitary rongeurs were utilized to remove any other loose disc pieces. Once this was completed, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. The Penfield elevator was placed in the disc space of L5-S1 and a crosstable x-ray did confirm this level. Nerve root was again expected exhibiting the foramina. A foraminotomy was created with a Kerrison rongeur. Once this was created, the nerve root was again inspected and deemed free of tension. It was mobile within the neural foramina. The wound was again copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. A free fat graft was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissues and placed over the exposed dura. Lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl interrupted fashion, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, and #4-0 undyed Vicryl was utilized to approximate the skin. Compression dressing was applied. The patient was turned, awoken, and noted to be moving all four extremities without apparent deficits. She was taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded due to her ongoing pain syndrome that has been requiring significant narcotic medications.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** A herniated disc at the L5‑S1 level on the left side.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same herniated disc at L5‑S1 on the left.  \n\n**Procedure performed:** A microscopic assisted removal of the disc (discectomy) and a small cut in the bone (laminotomy) at L5‑S1 on the left side.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia delivered through a breathing tube.  \n\n**Estimated blood loss:** Less than 50 cc.  \n\n**Specimens:** The removed disc was not sent to the lab.  \n\n**Drains:** None placed.  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**Surgical prognosis:** The outcome is uncertain because the patient still has ongoing pain and a Tarlov cyst near the L5 nerve root.  \n\n**Surgical indications:**  \nA 51‑year‑old woman has had severe lower back pain that radiates down her left leg for several months. Conservative treatments (medication, physical therapy, etc.) have not helped. The pain interferes with daily activities and work. She understands the risks, benefits, possible complications, and alternative treatments. She chose surgery to relieve her symptoms and gave informed consent.  \n\n**Operative technique (simplified):**  \n1. The patient was taken to the operating room and put under general anesthesia.  \n2. She was positioned face‑down on a special table. The surgeon identified the L5‑S1 space by feeling the hip bones and the spine.  \n3. The skin and tissue over the spine were cleaned and cut along a midline from L5 to S1.  \n4. The surgeon used cautery to stop bleeding and to cut through the tissue to reach the bone.  \n5. The ligament covering the bone (ligamentum flavum) was carefully removed to expose the spinal canal.  \n6. A small opening (laminotomy) was made in the bone on the left side with a bone‑cutting tool.  \n7. Under a microscope, the surgeon located the L5‑S1 nerve root, which was bulging over the herniated disc. The nerve was protected and moved aside.  \n8. A small cut (annulotomy) was made in the disc to access the herniated material. The protruding disc tissue was removed with specialized forceps. Additional loose disc pieces were also removed.  \n9. The area was washed thoroughly with antibiotic solution and dried.  \n10. The surgeon checked the level again with a small X‑ray to confirm the correct spot.  \n11. A second small opening (foraminotomy) was made to relieve pressure on the nerve root. The nerve was inspected again and found to be free of tension.  \n12. The wound was washed again and dried.  \n13. A small piece of fat from the surrounding tissue was placed over the exposed dura (the outer covering of the spinal cord).  \n14. The layers of tissue were stitched back together: bone and muscle with #1 Vicryl, under‑skin tissue with #2‑0 Vicryl, and skin with #4‑0 Vicryl. A compression dressing was applied.  \n\nThe patient was turned, awakened, and could move all four limbs without obvious problems. She was sent to recovery in good condition. The overall outlook remains uncertain because she continues to need strong pain medication for her chronic pain."
