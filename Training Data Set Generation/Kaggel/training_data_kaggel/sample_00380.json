  "medical": "NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY/CARDIAC STRESS REPORT INDICATION FOR STUDY: Recurrent angina pectoris in a patient with documented ischemic heart disease and underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy. PROCEDURE: The patient was studied in the resting state following intravenous delivery of adenosine triphosphate at 140 mcg/kg/min delivered over a total of 4 minutes. At completion of the second minute of infusion, the patient received technetium Cardiolite per protocol. During this interval, the blood pressure 150/86 dropped to near 136/80 and returned to near 166/84 at completion. No diagnostic electrocardiographic abnormalities were elaborated during this study. REGIONAL MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION WITH ADENOSINE PROVOCATION: Scintigraphic study reveals at this time multiple fixed defects in perfusion suggesting indeed multivessel coronary artery disease, yet no active ischemia at this time. A fixed defect is seen in the high anterolateral segment. A further fixed perfusion defect is seen in the inferoapical wall extending from close to the septum. There is no evidence for active ischemia in either distribution. Lateral wall moving towards the apex of the left ventricle is further involved from midway through the ventricle moving upward and into the high anterolateral vicinity. When viewed from the vertical projection, the high septal wall is preserved with significant loss of the mid anteroapical wall moving to the apex and in a wraparound fashion in the inferoapical wall. A limited segment of apical myocardium is still viable. No gated wall motion study was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiolite perfusion findings support multivessel coronary artery disease and likely previous multivessel infarct as has been elaborated above. There is no indication for active ischemia at this time.",
  "layman": "**Nuclear Cardiology / Cardiac Stress Test Report**\n\n**Reason for the test**  \nThe patient has chest pain that comes and goes (recurrent angina) and already has known heart disease caused by poor blood flow (ischemic heart disease) and weakened heart muscle (ischemic cardiomyopathy).\n\n**What was done**  \nThe test was performed while the patient was resting. A medicine called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was given through a vein at a rate of 140 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute for 4 minutes. After the second minute, the patient received a radioactive tracer called technetium Cardiolite, which is used to image the heart. During the test the blood pressure fell from 150/86 to about 136/80 and then rose back to about 166/84. The heart’s electrical activity (ECG) showed no new problems during the test.\n\n**Heart blood flow during the test**  \nThe imaging shows several areas where blood flow is permanently reduced, indicating that the patient has blockages in multiple coronary arteries. However, at the time of the test there is no evidence of new or active heart muscle stress (ischemia).  \n- One permanently reduced area is in the upper front part of the heart (high anterolateral segment).  \n- Another is in the lower front part near the center of the heart (inferoapical wall).  \n- The side wall of the heart that moves toward the tip of the left ventricle is also affected, especially from the middle of the ventricle upward into the high front area.  \n- When looking from above, the upper front wall is still working, but the middle front wall toward the tip is badly damaged and the lower front wall wraps around.  \n- A small part of the tip of the heart is still alive.  \nNo special test of the heart’s motion was done.\n\n**Summary**  \nThe Cardiolite images confirm that the patient has blockages in several coronary arteries and likely has had multiple past heart attacks. There is no sign of new or active heart muscle stress at this time."
