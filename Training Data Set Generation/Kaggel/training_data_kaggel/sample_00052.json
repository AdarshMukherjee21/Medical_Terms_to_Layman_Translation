TITLE OF THE OPERATION: Right frontotemporal craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma, biopsy of membranes, microtechniques. ASSISTANT: None. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 75-year-old man with a 6-week history of decline following a head injury. He was rendered unconscious by the head injury. He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi. This workup was negative. The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker. The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma. There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes. I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity. The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion. There was a roll beneath the right shoulder. The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint. Markings were applied. Sterile drapes were applied. A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline. Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia. Weitlaner retractors were inserted. A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle. I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis. A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm. The bone was set aside. The dura was clearly discolored and very tense. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade. There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure. Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity. The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section. The margins of the membrane were coagulated. The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery. The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none. The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon. Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system. The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers. Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl. Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon. Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL. Sponge and needle counts were correct. FINDINGS: Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane. I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure. Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood.",

He was checked for fainting problems in Mississippi and that workup was normal. He has a heart pacemaker. He was admitted to ABCD three days ago and had a CT scan yesterday that showed a large subdural hematoma. Because he has a history of bladder tumors, a contrast scan was done and it showed that the membranes around the blood were thick and bright. The blood was layered in the space. The surgeon decided to do a craniotomy (removing a piece of skull) instead of a small hole drainage because of the thick membranes, the bladder tumor history, and the layered blood. The patient and his family understood the surgery, its reasons, and its risks and agreed to proceed.  \n\n**Description of procedure:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia with a breathing tube. His head was turned to the left and supported on a cushion, with a roll under the right shoulder. The skull on the right side was shaved and cleaned with Betadine. The surgical area was marked and covered with sterile drapes. A straight cut was made along the coronal suture from just above the ear to near the middle of the head. The skin and underlying tissue were cut with a scalpel and a cautery device was used to cut the galea and temporalis muscle. Retractors were placed. A single small hole was made under the temporalis muscle. The craniotomy was positioned low for better cosmetic results. A cookie‑cutter shaped bone window about 5 cm × 4 cm was cut and set aside. The dura (the outer brain covering) was dark and tight. It was opened in a cross shape with a #15 blade. Immediately, a thin fluid shot out under high pressure, moving several inches from the first cut. The dura was pulled back and a small sample of the thick membrane was taken for permanent lab analysis. The edges of the membrane were cauterized. A microscope was used to see that the space had many septations (walls). These walls were cut with bipolar cautery. The wound was washed thoroughly and checked for bleeding – none was found. The dura was closed tightly with a running locking stitch of 4‑0 Nurolon. The bone flap was returned and fixed to the skull with a Lorenz plate system. The wound was washed again and closed in layers: muscle fascia and galea with interrupted 2‑0 Vicryl, and skin with a running locking 3‑0 nylon. Blood loss was less than 30 mL. All sponges and needles were counted correctly.  \n\n**Findings:** A chronic subdural hematoma with many septations and a thickened membrane. The arachnoid layer was not cut, and there was no blood in the subarachnoid space—only subdural blood."
