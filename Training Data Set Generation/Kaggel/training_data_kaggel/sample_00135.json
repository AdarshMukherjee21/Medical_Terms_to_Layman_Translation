  "medical": "CC: Depressed mental status. HX: 29y/o female fell down a flight of stairs on 2/20/95, striking the right side of her head. She then walked over to and lay down on a living room couch. She was found there, the next morning, by her boyfriend, poorly responsive and amidst a coffee ground like emesis. She was taken to a local ER and HCT revealed a right supraorbital fracture, right SDH and left SAH. Spine X-rays revealed a T12 vertebral body fracture. There were retinal hemorrhages, OU. She continued to be minimally responsive and was transferred to UIHC for lack of insurance and for neurologic/neurosurgical care. MEDS: (on transfer): Dilantin, Zantac, Proventil MDI, Tylenol. PMH: 1)pyelonephritis, 2) multiple STD's, 3) Polysubstance Abuse (ETOH, MJ, Amphetamine), 4)G5P4. FHX: unknown. SHX: polysubstance abuse. smoked 1 pack per day for 15years. EXAM: BP127/97, HR83, RR25, 37.2C MS: Minimal to no spontaneous speech. Unresponsive to verbal commands. Lethargic and somnolent. Groaned &quot;yes&quot; inappropriately. CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. VFFTT. Retinal hemorrhages, OU. EOM difficult to assess. Facial movement appeared symmetric. Tongue midline. Corneal and gag responses were intact. MOTOR: no spontaneous movement. withdrew extremities to noxious stimulation (e.g. deep nail bed pressure). Sensory: withdrew to noxious stimuli. Coord/Station/Gait: not tested. Reflexes: 2+/2+ BUE. 2/2 BLE. Babinski signs were present, bilaterally. HEENT: Periorbital and upper lid ecchymoses about the right eye. Scleral hemorrhage, OD. GEN EXAM: mild bruising of the extremities. COURSE: 2/27/95 HCT revealed a small liner high attenuation area lateral to the right parietal lobe with subtle increased attenuation of the tentorium cerebelli. These findings were felt to represent a right subdural hematoma and possible subarachnoid hemorrhage. 2/28/95 brain MRI revealed: 1)a small right-sided SDH, 2) Abnormal signal in the right occipital lobe with effacement of the gyri and sulci in the right PCA division most likely representing ischemic/vascular injury, 3)abnormal signal within the right basal ganglia/caudate nucleus consistent with ischemia, 4) abnormal signal in the uncal portion of the right frontal lobe consistent with contusion, 5) small parenchymal hemorrhage in the inferior anterior right temporal lobe, and 6) opacification of the right maxillary sinus. EEG, 2/28/95, was abnormal with occasional sharp transients in the left temporal region, and irregular (more or less continuous) right greater than left delta slow waves and decreased background activity in the right hemisphere: the findings were consistent with focal pathology on the right, seizure tendency in the left temporal region, and bilateral cerebral dysfunction. By the time of discharge, 4/17/95, she was verbalizing one or two words and required assistance with feeding and ambulation. She could not function independently.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** She was feeling very down and confused.  \n\n**History:** A 29‑year‑old woman fell down a flight of stairs on February 20, 1995, hitting the right side of her head. She walked to the living room couch and lay down. The next morning her boyfriend found her there, barely awake and vomiting coffee‑ground‑like material. She was taken to a local emergency room. A head CT scan showed a fracture above her eye, a right‑sided subdural hematoma (blood under the skull), and a left‑sided subarachnoid hemorrhage (blood in the space around the brain). X‑rays of her spine found a fracture in the T12 vertebra. Eye exams revealed bleeding in both retinas. Because she had no insurance and needed specialist care, she was transferred to UIHC.\n\n**Medications on transfer:** Dilantin, Zantac, Proventil inhaler, Tylenol.  \n\n**Past medical history:** 1) kidney infection, 2) several sexually transmitted diseases, 3) use of alcohol, marijuana, and amphetamines, 4) she has had five pregnancies and four births.  \n\n**Family history:** Unknown.  \n\n**Social history:** She uses multiple substances and smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for 15 years.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 127/97, heart rate 83, breathing 25 breaths/min, temperature 37.2 °C.  \n- Mental status: barely speaking, did not respond to spoken commands, sleepy and drowsy, made a “yes” sound when not appropriate.  \n- Eyes: pupils equal and 4 mm, got smaller to light. Vision was fine. Retinal bleeding in both eyes. Eye movements hard to see. Face looked even on both sides. Tongue was in the middle. Reflexes to the cornea and gag were normal.  \n- Motor: no movement on her own. She pulled her arms and legs back when something painful was pressed.  \n- Sensation: she pulled back when something painful was applied.  \n- Reflexes: normal in both arms and legs. Babinski sign (a sign of brain injury) was present on both sides.  \n- Head/neck: bruising around the right eye and upper eyelid, bleeding in the white part of the right eye.  \n- General: mild bruises on arms and legs.\n\n**Course of treatment:**  \n- February 27: CT showed a small high‑density area next to the right parietal lobe and a slightly thicker tentorium (the membrane covering the brain). These were thought to be a right subdural hematoma and possible subarachnoid bleed.  \n- February 28: MRI of the brain found:  \n  1. Small right‑sided subdural hematoma.  \n  2. Abnormal signal in the right occipital lobe with swelling, likely a stroke or vascular injury.  \n  3. Abnormal signal in the right basal ganglia/caudate nucleus, also likely a stroke.  \n  4. Abnormal signal in the right frontal lobe, a contusion (bruise).  \n  5. Small bleed in the lower front part of the right temporal lobe.  \n  6. Opacified right maxillary sinus.  \n  EEG on February 28 showed occasional sharp waves in the left temporal area, irregular slow waves more on the right side, and reduced background activity on the right, indicating focal brain problems on the right, a tendency to seizures on the left, and overall brain dysfunction.  \n- By discharge on April 17, she could say one or two words and needed help eating and walking. She could not live on her own."
