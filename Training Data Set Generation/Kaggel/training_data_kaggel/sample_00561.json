Two weeks prior to her evaluation at UIHC she agreed to have her sister pick her up for church at 8:15AM, Sunday morning. That Sunday she went to pick up her sister at her sister's home and when her sister was not there (because the sister had gone to pick up the patient) the patient left. She later called the sister and asked her if she (sister) had overslept. During her UIHC evaluation she denied she knew anything about the incident. No other complaints were brought forth by the patients family. PMH: Unremarkable. MEDS: None FHX: Father died of an MI, Mother had DM type II. SHX: Denies ETOH/illicit drug/Tobacco use. ROS: Unremarkable. EXAM: Afebrile, 80BPM, BP 158/98, 16RPM. Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Euthymic. 29/30 on Folstein's MMSE with deficit on drawing. Recalled 2/6 objects at five minutes and could not recite a list of 6 objects in 6 trials. Digit span was five forward and three backward. CN: mild right lower facial droop only. MOTOR: Full strength throughout. SENSORY: No deficits to PP/Vib/Prop/LT/Temp. COORD: Poor RAM in LUE only. GAIT: NB and ambulated without difficulty. STATION: No drift or Romberg sign. REFLEXES: 3+ bilaterally with flexor plantar responses. There were no frontal release signs. LABS: CMB, General Screen, FT4, TSH, VDRL were all WNL. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION, 12/7/92: Verbal associative fluency was defective. Verbal memory, including acquisition, and delayed recall and recognition, was severely impaired. Visual memory, including immediate and delayed recall was also severely impaired. Visuoperceptual discrimination was mildly impaired, as was 2-D constructional praxis. HCT, 12/7/92: Diffuse cerebral atrophy with associative mild enlargement of the ventricles consistent with patient's age. Calcification is seen in both globus pallidi and this was felt to be a normal variant.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint**  \nMemory loss.\n\n**History**  \nA 77‑year‑old woman with right‑handed heart failure has had worsening memory loss for the past year. Two weeks before she was seen at the hospital she had agreed to let her sister pick her up for church at 8:15 a.m. That Sunday she went to her sister’s house to pick her up, but her sister was not there because the sister had gone to pick up the patient. The patient then left. She later called her sister and asked if she had overslept. When she was examined at the hospital she said she did not know what had happened. No other problems were mentioned by her family.\n\n**Past medical history**  \nNothing notable.  \n**Medications**  \nNone.  \n**Family history**  \nFather died of a heart attack; mother has type‑2 diabetes.  \n**Social history**  \nNo alcohol, no illegal drugs, no smoking.  \n**Review of systems**  \nNo abnormal findings.\n\n**Physical exam**  \nShe had no fever, a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure 158/98, and 16 breaths per minute. She was awake, aware of who she was, where she was, and what time it was. She was calm. On a memory test she scored 29 out of 30, but had trouble with a drawing task. She remembered 2 of 6 items after five minutes and could not repeat a list of six items in six tries. She could count forward to five and backward to three. She had a slight droop on the lower part of her right face. Strength was normal in all limbs. She had no problems with touch, vibration, pain, temperature, or light touch. Her right arm had poor coordination. She walked normally, with no balance problems. Reflexes were a little brisk on both sides, and her feet pointed down when tapped. There were no obvious brain‑stem signs.\n\n**Labs**  \nComplete blood count, basic metabolic panel, thyroid tests, and a syphilis screen were all normal.\n\n**Neuropsychological testing (Dec 7 1992)**  \nShe had trouble finding words, and her verbal and visual memory were severely impaired. Her ability to see and use objects was mildly affected, and she had mild difficulty drawing simple shapes.\n\n**Brain scan (Dec 7 1992)**  \nThe scan showed overall shrinkage of the brain with a small increase in the size of the fluid spaces, which is normal for her age. There were small calcium deposits in both parts of the brain that are usually harmless."
