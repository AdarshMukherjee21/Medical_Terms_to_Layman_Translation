  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. INDICATIONS: Hematochezia, Personal history of colonic polyps. MEDICATIONS: Midazolam 2 mg IV, Fentanyl 100 mcg IV PROCEDURE: A History and Physical has been performed, and patient medication allergies have been reviewed. The patient's tolerance of previous anesthesia has been reviewed. The risks and benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and risks were discussed with the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained. Mental Status Examination: alert and oriented. Airway Examination: normal oropharyngeal airway and neck mobility. Respiratory Examination: clear to auscultation. CV Examination: RRR, no murmurs, no S3 or S4. ASA Grade Assessment: P1 A normal healthy patient. After reviewing the risks and benefits, the patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure. The anesthesia plan was to use conscious sedation. Immediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care were monitored throughout the procedure. The physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the procedure. After I obtained informed consent, the scope was passed under direct vision. Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturations were monitored continuously. The colonoscope was introduced through the anus and advanced to the cecum, identified by appendiceal orifice & IC valve. The quality of the prep was good. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: 1. A sessile, non-bleeding polyp was found in the rectum. The polyp was 5 mm in size. Polypectomy was performed with a saline injection-lift technique using the snare. Resection and retrieval were complete. Estimated blood loss was minimal. 2. One pedunculated, non-bleeding polyp was found in the sigmoid colon. The polyp was 7 mm in size. Polypectomy was performed with a hot forceps. Resection and retrieval were complete. Estimated blood loss was minimal. 3. Multiple large-mouthed diverticula were found in the descending colon. 4. Internal, non-bleeding, prolapsed with spontaneous reduction (grade II) hemorrhoids were found on retroflexion. IMPRESSION: 1. One 5 mm benign appearing polyp in the rectum. Resected and retrieved. 2. One 7 mm polyp in the sigmoid colon. Resected and retrieved. 3. Diverticulosis. 4. Internal hemorrhoids were found. RECOMMENDATION: 1. High fiber diet. 2. Await pathology results. 3. Repeat colonoscopy for surveillance in 3 years. 4. The findings and recommendations were discussed with the patient. CPT CODE(S): 45385, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by snare technique. 45384, 59, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by hot biopsy forceps or bipolar cautery. 45381, 59, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with directed submucosal injection(s), any substance.

  "layman": "**Procedure:** Colonoscopy  \n**Reason for the procedure:** Blood in stool (hematochezia) and a personal history of colon polyps.  \n\n**Medications given before the procedure:**  \n- Midazolam 2 mg IV (a sedative)  \n- Fentanyl 100 mcg IV (a pain reliever)  \n\n**Before the colonoscopy:**  \n- A full history and physical exam were done.  \n- The patient’s medication allergies and past reactions to anesthesia were checked.  \n- The risks and benefits of the colonoscopy and the sedation options were explained.  \n- All questions were answered and the patient gave informed consent.  \n- The patient was alert, oriented, and had a normal airway, breathing, and heart rhythm.  \n- The patient was considered healthy enough for the procedure.  \n\n**During the colonoscopy:**  \n- Conscious sedation was used.  \n- The patient’s heart rate, breathing, oxygen level, blood pressure, and overall response were monitored continuously.  \n- The colonoscope was inserted through the anus and advanced to the cecum (the beginning of the large intestine).  \n- The bowel prep was good and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n1. A 5 mm flat, non‑bleeding polyp in the rectum. It was removed with a snare after a saline lift.  \n2. A 7 mm stalked, non‑bleeding polyp in the sigmoid colon. It was removed with hot forceps.  \n3. Several large‑mouth diverticula (small pouches) in the descending colon.  \n4. Internal hemorrhoids that were prolapsed but had reduced on their own (grade II).  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- One 5 mm benign rectal polyp removed.  \n- One 7 mm benign sigmoid polyp removed.  \n- Diverticulosis (pouches in the colon).  \n- Internal hemorrhoids.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Eat a high‑fiber diet.  \n2. Wait for pathology results of the removed polyps.  \n3. Schedule a follow‑up colonoscopy in 3 years for surveillance.  \n4. Discussed all findings and recommendations with the patient.  \n\n**Coding (for billing):**  \n- 45385 – Colonoscopy with removal of lesions by snare.  \n- 45384, 59 – Colonoscopy with removal of lesions by hot forceps or cautery.  \n- 45381, 59 – Colonoscopy with submucosal injection.  \n\n**Diagnosis codes:**  \n- 211.4 – Benign tumor of rectum/anal canal.  \n- 211.3 – Benign tumor of colon.  \n- 562.10 – Diverticulosis of colon.  \n- 455.2 – Internal hemorrhoids with complications.  \n- 578.1 – Blood in stool.  \n- v12.72 – Personal history of colon polyps."
