  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female with moderate pain, severe swelling and a growth on the arm which is reportedly enlarging with limited range of motion for three months. FINDINGS: There is diffuse subcutis space edema extending along the posteromedial aspect of the elbow adjacent to the medial epicondyle, extending to the olecranon process and along the superficial aspect of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. There is no demonstrated solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion. There is enlargement with hyperintense signal of the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel. There is inflammation with mild laxity of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. The combined findings are most consistent with a ulnar nerve neuritis possibly secondary to a subluxing ulnar nerve however the ulnar nerve at this time is within the cubital tunnel. There is no accessory muscle within the cubital tunnel. The common flexor tendon origin is normal. Normal ulnar collateral ligamentous complex. There is mild epimysial sheath edema of the pronator teres muscle consistent with a mild epimysial sheath sprain but no muscular tear. There is minimal intratendinous inflammation of the common extensor tendon origin consistent with a mild tendinitis. There is no demonstrated common extensor tendon tear. Normal radial collateral ligamentous complex. Normal radiocapitellum and ulnotrochlear articulations. Normal triceps and biceps tendon insertions. There is peritendinous inflammation of the brachialis tendon insertion but an intrinsically normal tendon. IMPRESSION: Edema of the subcutis adipose space overlying the posteromedial aspect of the elbow with interstitial inflammation of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. Enlarged edematous ulnar nerve most compatible with ulnar nerve neuritis. The above combined findings suggest a subluxing ulnar nerve. Mild epimysial sheath strain of the pronator teres muscle but no muscular tear. Mild lateral epicondylitis with focal tendinitis of the origin of the common extensor tendon. Peritendinous edema of the brachialis tendon insertion. No solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion.",
  "layman": "A middle‑aged woman has moderate pain, severe swelling, and a bump on her arm that has been getting larger for three months and limits how far she can move her elbow.\n\n**Findings**  \n- The scan shows swelling in the fatty tissue just under the skin on the inside‑back side of the elbow, extending to the elbow tip and along a ligament near the elbow.  \n- No lump or mass is seen.  \n- The ulnar nerve inside the elbow tunnel is enlarged and looks inflamed.  \n- The ligament near the elbow is slightly loose and inflamed.  \n- These changes fit with inflammation of the ulnar nerve, possibly because the nerve is moving out of place, but it is still inside the tunnel.  \n- No extra muscle is seen in the tunnel.  \n- The tendons that pull the forearm muscles are normal.  \n- The ligament that supports the inside of the elbow is normal.  \n- The pronator teres muscle has mild swelling of its outer covering but no tear.  \n- The common extensor tendon at its origin has mild inflammation but no tear.  \n- The other ligaments and joint surfaces are normal.  \n- The tendon that pulls the brachialis muscle shows swelling around it but the tendon itself is fine.\n\n**Impression**  \n- Swelling in the fatty tissue under the skin on the inside‑back side of the elbow and inflammation of the ligament.  \n- The ulnar nerve is enlarged and inflamed, suggesting nerve inflammation and possible movement out of place.  \n- Mild strain of the outer covering of the pronator teres muscle but no tear.  \n- Mild inflammation of the common extensor tendon.  \n- Swelling around the brachialis tendon.  \n- No lump or mass."
