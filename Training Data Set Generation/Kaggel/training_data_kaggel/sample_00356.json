  "medical": "REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity. The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain. This has subsequently resolved. She started vigorous workouts in November 2005. In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician. By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made. She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits. She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe. Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe. She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm. She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg. Symptoms have been mildly progressive. She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above. She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms. No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below. She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised. At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Ocular migraines. 2. Myomectomy. 3. Infertility. 4. Hyperglycemia. 5. Asthma. 6. Hypercholesterolemia. MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort. ALLERGIES: Penicillin and aspirin. Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet. Of note, she does not drink or smoke. She is married with two adopted children. She is a paralegal specialist. She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds. Pain scale is 0. A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart. Of note, she has a normal general examination. Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk. She has mild postural tremor in both arms. She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities. Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis. She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left. Babinski's are downgoing. PERTINENT DATA: MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed. MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits. MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level. She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression. History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy. Results were discussed with the patient and her mother. I am concerned about progressive symptoms. Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis. If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis. I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation. I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem. I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving. The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically.",
  "layman": "**Reason for Neurological Consultation**  \nThe patient has cervical spondylosis (age‑related wear on the neck bones) and a kyphotic deformity (a forward curve of the spine). I saw her with Dr. X, took her history, did the exam, and made a plan.\n\n**History of Present Illness**  \nThe patient is a 45‑year‑old African‑American woman. About a year and a half ago she first felt pain in her left shoulder and neck; that pain went away. She started doing intense workouts in November 2005. In March of this year she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and went to her primary doctor. She had a nerve test that showed radiculopathy (nerve root irritation). An MRI of her lower back was normal. Later she felt tingling in her right middle toe, then numbness in her knees, elbows, and left middle toe. She also began feeling numbness in her left hand and arm. She says her knees feel a little wobbly and she drags her left leg a bit. Her symptoms have slowly gotten worse. She thinks the intense workouts might be the cause. She has no bowel or bladder problems and no position that helps. She has had two MRIs of her neck, which I reviewed. We discussed the possibility of surgery, but she is hesitant.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \n1. Ocular migraines  \n2. Myomectomy (uterine fibroid removal)  \n3. Infertility  \n4. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)  \n5. Asthma  \n6. High cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia)\n\n**Medications**  \nLipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac gel, Loprox cream, Rhinocort.\n\n**Allergies**  \nPenicillin and aspirin.\n\n**Family, Social, and Review of Systems**  \nShe does not drink or smoke. She is married with two adopted children and works as a paralegal specialist. She used to exercise vigorously but has been told to stop and now only walks. She reports mild blurred vision that has happened before and seems linked to headaches.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \nVitals: BP 138/82, pulse 90, breathing 14/min, weight 176.5 lbs. Pain score 0.  \nGeneral exam is normal.  \nNeurologic exam: She thinks clearly and her cranial nerves are fine. She has a mild tremor in both arms. She has slightly less sensation in the right palm and less light touch in the right palm. She has reduced vibration sense in both lower legs. Muscle strength is normal, but when she walks she shows a very subtle weakness on the left side. Reflexes are higher than normal in both legs, worse on the left. The Babinski sign is normal (downward).  \n\n**Pertinent Imaging**  \nBrain MRI (May 2006) is basically normal.  \nNeck MRIs (May 2006 and July 2006) show a large herniated disc at C6‑C7 with mild pressure on the spinal cord and a signal change that suggests swelling of the cord. There is also a large disc at C3‑C4 that slightly deforms the cord but does not show swelling.\n\n**Impression and Plan**  \nThe patient has cervical spondylosis with a large herniated disc at C6‑C7 that is mildly compressing the spinal cord and causing changes in the cord. There is a smaller disc at C3‑C4 with only subtle compression. Her history and exam show signs of myelopathy (spinal cord dysfunction). I discussed the findings with her and her mother. I am concerned that her symptoms could get worse and that she might develop paralysis, especially if she has a neck injury such as a car accident. I strongly recommended that she follow up soon for a surgical evaluation. I agree with previous doctors that she should avoid vigorous exercise, as it likely contributed to her problem. I also advised her to wear a hard collar while driving. I talked with the referring doctor on the phone about these results."
