  "medical": "CT ANGIOGRAPHY CHEST WITH CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Shortness of breath for two weeks and a history of pneumonia. The patient also has a history of left lobectomy. TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the chest were obtained for pulmonary embolism protocol utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of any acute pulmonary arterial embolism. The main pulmonary artery is enlarged showing a diameter of 4.7 cm. Cardiomegaly is seen with mitral valvular calcifications. Postsurgical changes of a left upper lobectomy are seen. Left lower lobe atelectasis is noted. A 7 mm and a 5 mm pulmonary nodule are seen within the left lower lobe (image #12). A small left pleural effusion is noted. Right lower lobe atelectasis is present. There is a right pleural effusion, greater than as seen on the left side. A right lower lobe pulmonary nodule measures 1.5 cm. There is a calcified granuloma within the right lower lobe. IMPRESSION: 1. Negative for pulmonary arterial embolism. 2. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery as can be seen with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 3. Cardiomegaly with mitral valvular calcifications. 4. Postsurgical changes of a left upper lobectomy. 5. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. 6. Bilateral lower lobe nodules, pulmonary nodules, and interval followup in three months to confirm stability versus further characterization with prior studies is advised.",
  "layman": "CT ANGIOGRAPHY CHEST WITH CONTRAST  \n**Reason for exam:** The patient has been short of breath for two weeks and has a history of pneumonia. The patient also had a left lung lobe removed in the past.  \n\n**Technique:** Chest CT images were taken using a pulmonary embolism protocol with 100 mL of Isovue‑300 contrast.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- No evidence of a new blood clot in the lung arteries.  \n- The main pulmonary artery is enlarged (4.7 cm in diameter).  \n- The heart is enlarged and the mitral valve shows calcium deposits.  \n- Changes from the previous left upper lobe removal are visible.  \n- The left lower lobe of the lung is partially collapsed.  \n- Two small nodules (7 mm and 5 mm) are seen in the left lower lobe.  \n- A small fluid collection (effusion) is present on the left side of the chest.  \n- The right lower lobe is also partially collapsed.  \n- A larger fluid collection is present on the right side.  \n- A 1.5 cm nodule is seen in the right lower lobe.  \n- A calcified granuloma (scar tissue with calcium) is present in the right lower lobe.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. No pulmonary embolism.  \n2. Enlarged main pulmonary artery, which can be seen with high blood pressure in the lungs.  \n3. Enlarged heart with calcium on the mitral valve.  \n4. Surgical changes from the left upper lobe removal.  \n5. Fluid on both sides of the chest, more on the right, and collapsed lower lobes on both sides.  \n6. Nodules in both lower lobes; a follow‑up scan in three months is recommended to see if they stay the same or need further evaluation."
