POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Large herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6 with myelopathy (722.21). 2. Cervical spondylosis. 3. Cervical stenosis, C5-C6 secondary to above (723.0), with surgical findings confirmed. PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 with spinal cord and spinal canal decompression (63075). 2. Anterior interbody fusion at C5-C6, (22554) utilizing Bengal cage (22851). 3. Anterior instrumentation for stabilization by Uniplate construction, C5-C6, (22845); with intraoperative x-ray times two. ANESTHESIA: General. SERVICE: Neurosurgery. OPERATION: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected only in a subplatysmal manner bluntly, and with only blunt dissection at the prevertebral space where a localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained, once self-retaining retractors were placed along the mesial edge of a cauterized longus colli muscle, to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case. A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved. This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section. Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well. A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status. At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation. Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied. Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner. The wound was inspected, and irrigated again with antibiotic solution and after further inspection was finally closed in a routine closure in a multiple layer event by first approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was Steri-Stripped for reinforcement, and a sterile dressing was applied, incorporating a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in the usual manner. Once the sterile dressing was applied, the patient was taken from the operating room to the recovery area having left in stable condition. At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.",

General wear‑and‑tear of the neck bones (cervical spondylosis).  \n3. Narrowing of the spinal canal at C5‑C6 because of the disc problem – code 723.0.  \n\n**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES**  \n1. Large herniated disc at C5‑C6 with myelopathy – code 722.21.  \n2. Cervical spondylosis.  \n3. Cervical stenosis at C5‑C6 confirmed by the surgery – code 723.0.  \n\n**PROCEDURES**  \n1. Front‑side removal of the damaged disc at C5‑C6 and relief of pressure on the spinal cord and canal (procedure code 63075).  \n2. Fusion of the two vertebrae at C5‑C6 using a special cage called a Bengal cage (procedure code 22554).  \n3. Attachment of a plate (Uniplate) to hold the bones steady (procedure code 22845). Two intra‑operative x‑rays were taken.  \n\n**ANESTHESIA**  \nGeneral anesthesia.  \n\n**SERVICE**  \nNeurosurgery.  \n\n**OPERATION**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and placed on his back. General anesthesia was given. The neck was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A straight cut was made along the skin fold just to the right of the middle of the neck, reaching the edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. The skin was cut to the platysma muscle, which was lifted gently. The surgeon used blunt tools to reach the space in front of the vertebrae and took an x‑ray to confirm the location. Retractors were placed along the edge of the longus colli muscle to protect surrounding tissues.  \n\nA large bone spur at C5‑C6 was found and removed with a rongeur; the bone fragments were saved. The disc was opened with a #11 blade and removed with forceps; pieces were sent to pathology. Remaining bone spurs and disc fragments were removed with small rongeurs; drilling extended into normal bone as needed. Thickened ligament and posterior spurs were removed until the dura (the covering of the spinal cord) bulged, showing that the pressure had been relieved. No cerebrospinal fluid leak was seen, and bleeding was controlled with Gelfoam and antibiotic irrigation.  \n\nThe decompression was checked with a double‑ball dissector; the dura bulged and pulsed. A Bengal cage filled with the patient’s own bone and fusion putty was placed and secured. A Uniplate with screws was added for extra stability.  \n\nThe wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution, then closed in layers: the platysma was stitched with 3‑0 Vicryl, the skin with a 4‑0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch, and the area was reinforced with Steri‑Strips. A Penrose drain was placed from the prevertebral space to the skin and secured with a safety pin.  \n\nAfter dressing, the patient was moved to the recovery area in stable condition. All instruments, needles, and sponges were counted correctly, and there were no complications during the surgery."
