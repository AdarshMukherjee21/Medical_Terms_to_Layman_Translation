  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:Left knee pain. FINDINGS: Comparison is made with 10/13/05 radiographs. There is a prominent suprapatellar effusion. Patient has increased signal within the medial collateral ligament as well as fluid around it, compatible with type 2 sprain. There is fluid around the lateral collateral ligament without increased signal within the ligament itself, compatible with type 1 sprain. Medial and lateral menisci contain some minimal increased signal centrally that does not extend through an articular surface and findings are felt to represent minimal myxoid degeneration. No tear is seen. Anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligaments are intact. There is a bone bruise of medial patellar facet measuring approximately 8 x 5 mm. There is suggestion of some mild posterior aspect of the lateral tibial plateau. MR signal on the bone marrow is otherwise normal. IMPRESSION: Type 2 sprain in the medial collateral ligament and type sprain in the lateral collateral ligament. Joint effusion and bone bruise with suggestion of some minimal overlying chondromalacia and medial patellar facet.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the left knee without contrast  \nCLINICAL: The patient has pain in the left knee.  \n\nFINDINGS: The scan was compared with X‑rays taken on 10/13/05.  \n- There is a large fluid collection above the kneecap (suprapatellar effusion).  \n- The medial collateral ligament (inner knee ligament) shows increased signal and has fluid around it, indicating a type 2 sprain.  \n- The lateral collateral ligament (outer knee ligament) has fluid around it but no signal change in the ligament itself, indicating a type 1 sprain.  \n- Both the medial and lateral menisci (cartilage pads) have a small amount of increased signal in the center that does not reach the joint surface; this is thought to be mild degeneration. No tears are seen.  \n- The anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament are intact.  \n- There is a bone bruise on the medial side of the patella measuring about 8 × 5 mm.  \n- There is a slight change at the back of the lateral tibial plateau.  \n- Bone marrow signal is otherwise normal.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Type 2 sprain of the medial collateral ligament and type 1 sprain of the lateral collateral ligament. The knee has fluid and a bone bruise, with a small amount of cartilage wear over the medial patellar facet."
