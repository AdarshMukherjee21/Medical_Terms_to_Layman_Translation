  "layman": "This is a 37‑year‑old woman who is pregnant with twins and is at risk of going into labor early.  \n\n**General findings**  \n- Twin B’s heart is beating normally at 166 beats per minute.  \n- The babies are lying side‑by‑side, with Twin B facing the mother’s right side.  \n- Both babies are head‑first (cephalic).  \n- The placenta is fused and located at the back of the uterus (grade I‑II).  \n- The uterus and cervix are normal and the cervix is closed.  \n- The area around the ovaries (adnexa) is not visible.  \n- Amniotic fluid is low: the fluid index is 5.5 cm in one pocket.  \n\n**Measurements**  \n- Biparietal diameter (BPD): 7.9 cm → about 31 weeks 5 days.  \n- Head circumference (HC): 31.1 cm → about 33 weeks 3 days.  \n- Abdominal circumference (AC): 30.0 cm → about 34 weeks 0 days.  \n- Femur length (FL): 6.4 cm → about 33 weeks 1 day.  \n\n**Ratios**  \n- BPD/OFD: 77 (normal range 70‑86).  \n- FL/BPD: 81 (normal 71‑87).  \n- FL/HC: 21.3 (normal 19.9‑21.5).  \n- FL/AC: 21 (normal 20‑24).  \n- HC/AC: 1.00 (normal 0.96‑1.11).  \n\n**Gestational age**  \n- By this ultrasound: 33 weeks 0 days (± 2 weeks 2 days).  \n- Estimated fetal weight: 2194 g (4 lb 13 oz) – 6th percentile.  \n- Estimated due date (EDD) from this scan: July 30, 2007.  \n\n**Other dates**  \n- By dates: 35 weeks 5 days.  \n- Last menstrual period (LMP) not given.  \n- EDD by dates: July 11, 2007.  \n- Previous ultrasound (April 20, 2007): 35 weeks 2 days, EDD July 13, 2007.  \n\n**Anatomy**  \n- Heart chambers, ventricles, cerebellum, skull, face, nose, mouth, diaphragm, stomach, kidneys, bladder, limbs, spine, and abdominal wall all look normal.  \n- The umbilical cord has three vessels and is wrapped around the neck (nuchal cord).  \n\n**Impression**  \n- The twins share one placenta but have two separate amniotic sacs (monochorionic diamniotic).  \n- Twin B is smaller than expected for its age and is similar in size to Twin A.  \n- There is a nuchal cord and low amniotic fluid."
