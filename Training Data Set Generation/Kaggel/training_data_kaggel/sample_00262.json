  "medical": "OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Colonoscopy and biopsies, epinephrine sclerotherapy, hot biopsy cautery, and snare polypectomy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Colon cancer screening. 2. Family history of colon polyps. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Multiple colon polyps (5). 2. Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon. 3. Internal hemorrhoids. ENDOSCOPE USED: EC3870LK. BIOPSIES: Biopsies taken from all polyps. Hot biopsy got applied to one. Epinephrine sclerotherapy and snare polypectomy applied to four polyps. ANESTHESIA: Fentanyl 75 mcg, Versed 6 mg, and glucagon 1.5 units IV push in divided doses. Also given epinephrine 1:20,000 total of 3 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus after appropriate sedation. Digital rectal examination was done, which was normal. Endoscope was introduced and passed through a rather spastic tortuous sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula seen all the way through transverse colon where about 1 cm x 1 cm sessile polyp was seen. It was biopsied and then in piecemeal fashion removed using snare polypectomy after base was infiltrated with epinephrine. Pedunculated polyp next to it was hard to see and there was a lot of peristalsis. The scope then was advanced through rest of the transverse colon to ascending colon and cecum. Terminal ileum was briefly reviewed, appeared normal and so did cecum after copious amount of fecal material was irrigated out. Ascending colon was unremarkable. At hepatic flexure may be proximal transverse colon, there was a sessile polyp about 1.2 cm x 1 cm that was removed in the same manner with a biopsy taken, base infiltrated with epinephrine and at least two passes of snare polypectomy and subsequent hot biopsy cautery removed to hold polypoid tissue, which could be seen. In transverse colon on withdrawal and relaxation with epinephrine, an additional 1 mm to 2 mm sessile polyp was removed by hot biopsy. Then in the transverse colon, additional larger polyp about 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm was removed in piecemeal fashion again with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare polypectomy. Subsequently pedunculated polyp in distal transverse colon near splenic flexure was removed with snare polypectomy. The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were unremarkable. Diverticulosis was again seen with almost constant spasm despite of glucagon. Sigmoid colon did somewhat hinder the inspection of that area. Rectum, retroflexion posterior anal canal showed internal hemorrhoids moderate to large. Excess of air insufflated was removed. The endoscope was withdrawn. PLAN: Await biopsy report. Pending biopsy report, recommendation will be made when the next colonoscopy should be done at least three years perhaps sooner besides and due to multitude of the patient's polyps.",
  "layman": "**OPERATIVE PROCEDURES**  \nThe doctor performed a colonoscopy and took tissue samples (biopsies). They also used epinephrine sclerotherapy, hot biopsy cautery, and a snare to remove polyps.\n\n**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES**  \n1. Screening for colon cancer.  \n2. Family history of colon polyps.\n\n**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES**  \n1. Five colon polyps were found.  \n2. Diverticulosis (small pouches) in the sigmoid colon.  \n3. Internal hemorrhoids.\n\n**ENDOSCOPE USED**  \nEC3870LK.\n\n**BIOPSIES**  \nAll polyps were sampled. One polyp was treated with hot biopsy cautery. Four polyps were treated with epinephrine sclerotherapy and snare removal.\n\n**ANESTHESIA**  \nThe patient received:  \n- Fentanyl 75 mcg  \n- Versed 6 mg  \n- Glucagon 1.5 units IV, given in divided doses  \n- Epinephrine 1:20,000, total 3 mL  \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n**PROCEDURE**  \nThe patient lay on her left side after sedation. A digital rectal exam was normal. The endoscope was inserted and passed through a tight, twisting sigmoid colon that had many diverticula. It continued through the transverse colon where a 1 cm × 1 cm flat polyp was seen. The polyp was biopsied and then removed in pieces with a snare after the base was injected with epinephrine. A nearby stalked polyp was hard to see because of strong muscle contractions.\n\nThe scope was then advanced through the rest of the transverse colon, the ascending colon, and the cecum. The terminal ileum and cecum looked normal after cleaning out stool. The ascending colon was normal. At the hepatic flexure (or upper part of the transverse colon) a 1.2 cm × 1 cm flat polyp was removed in the same way: biopsy, epinephrine injection, at least two snare passes, and hot biopsy cautery to remove the tissue. While withdrawing the scope, a small 1–2 mm flat polyp was removed with hot biopsy. A larger 1.3 cm × 1.2 cm flat polyp was then removed piece by piece with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare. A stalked polyp near the splenic flexure was removed with a snare. The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were normal. Diverticulosis was again seen, and the colon stayed spasm‑y despite glucagon. The sigmoid colon made it hard to see that area. In the rectum, a retroflexed view of the posterior anal canal showed moderate to large internal hemorrhoids. Extra air was removed, and the scope was withdrawn.\n\n**PLAN**  \nWe will wait for the biopsy results. Once the results are in, we will decide when the next colonoscopy should be scheduled—at least in three years, but possibly sooner because of the many polyps found."
