  "medical": "EXAM:MRI RIGHT FOOT CLINICAL:Pain and swelling in the right foot. FINDINGS: Obtained for second opinion interpretation is an MRI examination performed on 11-04-05. There is a transverse fracture of the anterior superior calcaneal process of the calcaneus. The fracture is corticated however and there is an active marrow stress phenomenon. There is a small ganglion measuring approximately 8 x 5 x 5mm in size extending along the bifurcate ligament. There is no substantial joint effusion of the calcaneocuboid articulation. There is minimal interstitial edema involving the short plantar calcaneal cuboid ligament. Normal plantar calcaneonavicular spring ligament. Normal talonavicular articulation. There is minimal synovial fluid within the peroneal tendon sheaths. Axial imaging of the ankle has not been performed orthogonal to the peroneal tendon distal to the retromalleolar groove. The peroneus brevis tendon remains intact extending to the base of the fifth metatarsus. The peroneus longus tendon can be identified in its short axis extending to its distal plantar insertion upon the base of the first metatarsus with minimal synovitis. There is minimal synovial fluid within the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath with pooling of the fluid in the region of the knot of Henry. There is edema extending along the deep surface of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle. Normal anterior, subtalar and deltoid ligamentous complex. Normal naviculocuneiform, intercuneiform and tarsometatarsal articulations. The Lisfrancs ligament is intact. The Achilles tendon insertion has been excluded from the field-of-view. Normal plantar fascia and intrinsic plantar muscles of the foot. There is mild venous distention of the veins of the foot within the tarsal tunnel. There is minimal edema of the sinus tarsus. The lateral talocalcaneal and interosseous talocalcaneal ligaments are normal. Normal deltoid ligamentous complex. Normal talar dome and no occult osteochondral talar dome defect. IMPRESSION: Transverse fracture of the anterior calcaneocuboid articulation with cortication and cancellous marrow edema. Small ganglion intwined within the bifurcate ligament. Interstitial edema of the short plantar calcaneocuboid ligament. Minimal synovitis of the peroneal tendon sheaths but no demonstrated peroneal tendon tear. Minimal synovitis of the flexor tendon sheaths with pooling of fluid within the knot of Henry. Minimal interstitial edema extending along the deep surface of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** MRI of the right foot  \n**Clinical:** Pain and swelling in the right foot.  \n\n**Findings:**  \nThe MRI was done on 11‑04‑05 for a second opinion.  \n- There is a horizontal break (fracture) in the front part of the heel bone (calcaneus). The break shows signs of healing (cortication) and the bone marrow around it is stressed.  \n- A small fluid‑filled sac (ganglion) about 8 × 5 × 5 mm is seen along the bifurcate ligament.  \n- The joint between the heel and the cuboid bone (calcaneocuboid joint) does not have much fluid.  \n- A little swelling (edema) is present in the short plantar calcaneocuboid ligament.  \n- The spring ligament under the foot (plantar calcaneonavicular) looks normal.  \n- The joint between the talus and navicular bones is normal.  \n- Only a small amount of fluid is in the sheaths around the peroneal tendons.  \n- Axial images of the ankle were not taken in the proper plane beyond the retromalleolar groove.  \n- The peroneus brevis tendon is intact all the way to the base of the fifth toe.  \n- The peroneus longus tendon is visible in its short axis and reaches its normal spot on the base of the first toe, with only a little inflammation.  \n- A small amount of fluid is in the sheaths of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendons, pooling near the knot of Henry.  \n- Swelling is seen along the deep side of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle.  \n- The front, subtalar, and deltoid ligaments are normal.  \n- The joints between the navicular and cuneiform bones, the cuneiforms themselves, and the tarsometatarsal joints are normal.  \n- The Lisfranc ligament is intact.  \n- The Achilles tendon insertion was not included in the scan.  \n- The plantar fascia and the small muscles inside the foot are normal.  \n- The veins in the foot show mild enlargement within the tarsal tunnel.  \n- There is a little swelling in the sinus tarsus.  \n- The lateral talocalcaneal and interosseous talocalcaneal ligaments are normal.  \n- The deltoid ligament complex is normal.  \n- The top of the talus (talar dome) is normal, with no hidden bone or cartilage defect.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- Horizontal fracture of the front part of the heel‑cuboid joint, with healing signs and bone marrow swelling.  \n- Small ganglion tied to the bifurcate ligament.  \n- Swelling in the short plantar calcaneocuboid ligament.  \n- Minor inflammation in the peroneal tendon sheaths, but no tendon tear.  \n- Minor inflammation in the flexor tendon sheaths, with fluid pooling near the knot of Henry.  \n- Minor swelling along the deep side of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle."
