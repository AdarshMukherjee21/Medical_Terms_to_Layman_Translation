  "medical": "CLINICAL HISTORY: A 68-year-old white male with recently diagnosed adenocarcinoma by sputum cytology. An abnormal chest radiograph shows right middle lobe infiltrate and collapse. Patient needs staging CT of chest with contrast. Right sided supraclavicular and lower anterior cervical adenopathy noted on physical exam. TECHNIQUE: Multiple transaxial images utilized in 10 mm sections were obtained through the chest. Intravenous contrast was administered. FINDINGS: There is a large 3 x 4 cm lymph node seen in the right supraclavicular region. There is a large right paratracheal lymph node best appreciated on image #16 which measures 3 x 2 cm. A subcarinal lymph node is enlarged also. It measures 6 x 2 cm. Multiple pulmonary nodules are seen along the posterior border of the visceral as well as parietal pleura. There is a pleural mass seen within the anterior sulcus of the right hemithorax as well as the right crus of the diaphragm. There is also a soft tissue density best appreciated on image #36 adjacent to the inferior aspect of the right lobe of the liver which most likely also represents metastatic deposit. The liver parenchyma is normal without evidence of any dominant masses. The right kidney demonstrates a solitary cyst in the mid pole of the right kidney. IMPRESSION: 1. Greater than twenty pulmonary nodules demonstrated on the right side to include pulmonary nodules within the parietal as well as various visceral pleura with adjacent consolidation most likely representing pulmonary neoplasm. 2. Extensive mediastinal adenopathy as described above. 3. No lesion seen within the left lung at this time. 4. Supraclavicular adenopathy.",
  "layman": "CLINICAL HISTORY: A 68‑year‑old white man was recently found to have lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) from a sputum test. A chest X‑ray shows an area of infection and collapse in the right middle lung. He needs a CT scan of the chest with contrast to see how far the cancer has spread. On exam, enlarged lymph nodes were found above the right collarbone and in the lower front neck.\n\nTECHNIQUE: The CT scan used many cross‑sectional images taken every 10 mm through the chest. A contrast dye was given through a vein.\n\nFINDINGS:  \n- A large lymph node (3 × 4 cm) is seen above the right collarbone.  \n- A big lymph node (3 × 2 cm) is next to the trachea on the right side.  \n- Another enlarged lymph node (6 × 2 cm) is below the trachea.  \n- Many small lung nodules are seen along the back edge of the lung lining (visceral pleura) and the outer lung lining (parietal pleura).  \n- A mass in the front part of the right chest cavity and near the right side of the diaphragm is present.  \n- A soft‑tissue spot (likely a cancer spread) is seen next to the lower part of the right liver lobe. The liver itself looks normal with no big tumors.  \n- The right kidney has one small cyst in its middle part.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. More than twenty lung nodules on the right side, including nodules in the lung lining and nearby lung tissue, most likely from cancer.  \n2. Large spread of lymph nodes in the chest area.  \n3. No abnormal spots in the left lung at this time.  \n4. Enlarged lymph nodes above the collarbone."
