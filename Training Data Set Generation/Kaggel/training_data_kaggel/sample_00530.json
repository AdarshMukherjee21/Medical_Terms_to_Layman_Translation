  "medical": "EXAM: Noncontrast CT scan of the lumbar spine REASON FOR EXAM: Left lower extremity muscle spasm. COMPARISONS: None. FINDINGS: Transaxial thin slice CT images of the lumbar spine were obtained with sagittal and coronal reconstructions on emergency basis, as requested. No abnormal paraspinal masses are identified. There are sclerotic changes with anterior effusion of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally. There is marked intervertebral disk space narrowing at the L5-S1 level with intervertebral disk vacuum phenomenon and advanced endplate degenerative changes. Posterior disk osteophyte complex is present, most marked in the left paracentral to lateral region extending into the lateral recess on the left. This most likely will affect the S1 nerve root on the left. There are posterior hypertrophic changes extending into the neural foramina bilaterally inferiorly. There is mild neural foraminal stenosis present. Small amount of extruded disk vacuum phenomenon is present on the left in the region of the exiting nerve root. There is facet sclerosis bilaterally. Mild lateral recess stenosis just on the right, there is prominent anterior spondylosis. At the L4-5 level, mild bilateral facet arthrosis is present. There is broad based posterior annular disk bulging or protrusion, which mildly effaces the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and extends into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina bilaterally. No moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified. At the L3-4 level anterior spondylosis is present. There are endplate degenerative changes with mild posterior annular disk bulging, but no evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the L2-3 level, there is mild bilateral ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. Mild posterior annular disk bulging is present without evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the T12-L1 and L1-2 levels, there is no evidence of herniated disk protrusion, central canal, or neural foraminal stenosis. There is arteriosclerotic vascular calcification of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries without evidence of aneurysm or dilatation. No bony destructive changes or acute fractures are identified. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Advanced degenerative disk disease at the L5-S1 level. 2. Probable chronic asymmetric herniated disk protrusion with peripheral calcification at the L5-S1 level, laterally in the left paracentral region extending into the lateral recess causing lateral recess stenosis. 3. Mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at the L5-S1 level. 4. Posterior disk bulging at the L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5 levels without evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal stenosis. 5. Facet arthrosis to the lower lumbar spine. 6. Arteriosclerotic vascular disease.",
  "layman": "EXAM: CT scan of the lower back without contrast  \nREASON: Muscle spasm in the left leg  \nCOMPARISONS: None  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n- Thin‑slice CT images of the lumbar spine were taken quickly, with side‑by‑side and front‑to‑back views.  \n- No abnormal masses were seen next to the spine.  \n- Both sacroiliac joints (where the spine meets the pelvis) show hardening and fluid buildup.  \n- The disc space between the L5 and S1 vertebrae is very narrow, with gas pockets and severe wear on the bone ends.  \n- A bony growth (osteophyte) at the back of the disc is most prominent on the left side, reaching into the space where the left S1 nerve root exits.  \n- The back of the disc and surrounding bone are thickened, narrowing the openings (foramina) on both sides at the lower levels.  \n- A small disc fragment with gas is present on the left near the exiting nerve root.  \n- The facet joints on both sides show hardening.  \n- Mild narrowing of the right side’s lateral recess, with prominent front‑side bone growth.  \n- At L4‑5, mild wear of the facet joints on both sides.  \n- A broad bulge of the disc at L4‑5 slightly presses on the front of the spinal fluid sac and extends into the lower part of the foramina on both sides. No moderate or severe narrowing of the central canal or foramina is seen.  \n- At L3‑4, front‑side bone growth is present. Mild disc bulge on the back, but no moderate or severe narrowing.  \n- At L2‑3, mild thickening of the ligament that runs along the spine. Mild disc bulge on the back, no moderate or severe narrowing.  \n- At T12‑L1 and L1‑2, no disc herniation or narrowing.  \n- The abdominal aorta and iliac arteries show calcification from hardening of the vessels, but no aneurysm or enlargement.  \n- No bone destruction or recent fractures.  \n\nCONCLUSIONS:  \n1. Severe disc degeneration at L5‑S1.  \n2. Likely chronic, uneven disc herniation with calcified edges at L5‑S1, on the left side, causing narrowing of the lateral recess.  \n3. Mild narrowing of the foramina on both sides at L5‑S1.  \n4. Disc bulges at L2‑3, L3‑4, and L4‑5, but no moderate or severe central canal narrowing.  \n5. Wear of the facet joints in the lower lumbar spine.  \n6. Hardening of the blood vessels."
