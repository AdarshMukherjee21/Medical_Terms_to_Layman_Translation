  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Sleep study. CLINICAL INFORMATION: This patient is a 56-year-old gentleman who had symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea with snoring, hypertension. The test was done 01/24/06. The patient weighed 191 pounds, five feet, seven inches tall. SLEEP QUESTIONNAIRE: According to the patient's own estimate, the patient took about 15 minutes to fall asleep, slept for six and a half hours, did have some dreams. Did not wake up and the sleep was less refreshing. He was sleepy in the morning. STUDY PROTOCOL: An all night polysomnogram was recorded with a Compumedics E Series digital polysomnograph. After the scalp was prepared, Ag/AgCl electrodes were applied to the scalp according to the International 10-20 System. EEG was monitored from C4-A1, C3-A2, O2-A1 and O2-A1. EOG and EMG were continuously monitored by electrodes placed at the outer canthi and chin respectively. Nasal and oral airflow were monitored using a triple port Thermistor. Respiratory effort was measured by piezoelectric technology employing an abdominal and thoracic belt. Blood oxygen saturation was continuously monitored by pulse oximetry. Heart rate and rhythm were monitored by surface electrocardiography. Anterior tibialis EMG was studied by using surface mounted electrodes placed 5 cm apart on both legs. Body position and snoring level were also monitored. TECHNICAL QUALITY OF STUDY: Good. ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC MEASUREMENTS: Total recording time 406 minutes, total sleep time 365 minutes, sleep latency 25.5 minutes, REM latency 49 minutes, _____ 90%, sleep latency measured 86%. _____ period was obtained. The patient spent 10% of the time awake in bed. Stage I: 3.8 Stage II: 50.5 Stage III: 14% Stage REM: 21.7% The patient had relatively good sleep architecture, except for excessive waking. RESPIRATORY MEASUREMENTS: Total apnea/hypopnea 75, age index 12.3 per hour. REM age index 15 per hour. Total arousal 101, arousal index 15.6 per hour. Oxygen desaturation was down to 88%. Longest event 35 second hypopnea with an FiO2 of 94%. Total limb movements 92, PRM index 15.1 per hour. PRM arousal index 8.9 per hour. ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS: Heart rate while asleep 60 to 64 per minute, while awake 70 to 78 per minute. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with moderately loud snoring and significant apnea/hypopnea index. RECOMMENDATIONS: AXIS B: Overnight polysomnography. AXIS C: Hypertension. The patient should return for nasal CPAP titration. Sleep apnea if not treated, may lead to chronic hypertension, which may have cardiovascular consequences. Excessive daytime sleepiness, dysfunction and memory loss may also occur.",

The study was done on 01/24/06.  \n\n**Sleep questionnaire:** He says it takes him about 15 minutes to fall asleep, sleeps for about 6½ hours, and has some dreams. He does not wake up during the night, but his sleep feels less refreshing. He feels sleepy in the morning.  \n\n**Study protocol:** An overnight sleep test (polysomnogram) was recorded with a Compumedics E Series machine. After cleaning his scalp, electrodes were placed on his head using the standard 10‑20 system. Brain waves were recorded from C4‑A1, C3‑A2, O2‑A1, and O2‑A1. Eye movements and muscle tone were monitored with electrodes on the outer corners of his eyes and his chin. Airflow through his nose and mouth was measured with a triple‑port thermistor. Breathing effort was measured with belts around his abdomen and chest. Blood oxygen levels were continuously checked with a pulse oximeter. Heart rate and rhythm were monitored with a surface ECG. Muscle activity in his lower legs was measured with electrodes on both legs. His body position and snoring level were also recorded.  \n\n**Technical quality:** Good.  \n\n**Electrophysiologic measurements:**  \n- Total recording time: 406 minutes  \n- Total sleep time: 365 minutes  \n- Time to fall asleep: 25.5 minutes  \n- Time to first REM sleep: 49 minutes  \n- 90 % of the time was spent in sleep stages (stage I: 3.8 %, stage II: 50.5 %, stage III: 14 %, REM: 21.7 %)  \n- He was awake in bed 10 % of the time.  \n\n**Respiratory measurements:**  \n- 75 total apnea/hypopnea events (average 12.3 per hour)  \n- REM apnea/hypopnea index: 15 per hour  \n- 101 total arousals (15.6 per hour)  \n- Lowest oxygen level: 88 %  \n- Longest event: 35‑second hypopnea with 94 % oxygen  \n- 92 limb movements (15.1 per hour)  \n- 8.9 per hour of limb movement arousals  \n\n**Heart observations:**  \n- Heart rate while asleep: 60‑64 beats per minute  \n- Heart rate while awake: 70‑78 beats per minute  \n\n**Conclusions:** The patient has obstructive sleep apnea with moderately loud snoring and a significant apnea/hypopnea index.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Axis B: Overnight polysomnography.  \n- Axis C: Hypertension.  \n- He should return for a nasal CPAP titration test.  \n\n(Additional notes: Untreated sleep apnea can worsen high blood pressure and may lead to heart problems. It can also cause daytime sleepiness, trouble functioning, and memory issues.)"
