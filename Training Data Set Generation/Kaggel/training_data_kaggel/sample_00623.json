Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation from C3 to C6 using a Synthes Small Stature Plate, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This 62-year-old man has severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at C5-C6. There was a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at C4-C5. C3-C4 was the source of neck pain as documented by facet injections. A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the pros and cons of the surgery by two levels versus three levels. Because of the severe component of the neck pain that has been relieved with facet injections, we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. I explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risks and alternatives. He clearly understands and has no further questions and requests that I proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position. The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosages. The left side of the neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A transverse incision was made in the neck crease. Dissection was carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine was exposed. The medial borders of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachments to the spine. Caspar self-retaining pins were placed into the bodies of C3, C4, C5, and C6 and x-ray localization was obtained. A needle was placed in what was revealed to be the disk space at C4-C5 and an x-ray confirmed proper localization. Self-retaining retractors were then placed in the wound, taking great care to keep the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles. First I removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophytes at C5-C6 and distracted the space. The high-speed cutting bur was used to drill back the osteophytes towards the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. An incision was then made at C4-C5 and the annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. The retractors were then adjusted and again discectomy was performed at C3-C4 back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. The operating microscope was then utilized. Working under magnification, I started at C3-C4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament. The ligament was incised and the underlying dura was exposed. I worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the C4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen. There were a large number of veins overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding, I left them intact. However, I could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right. The microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved. The retractors were readjusted and attention was turned to C4-C5. I worked down through bony osteophytes and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament. The ligament was incised; and as I worked to the right of the midline, I encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces. The C5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen. The root had a somewhat high takeoff but I worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it. Again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved. Central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression. This was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm Cloward punches. Attention was then turned to the C5-C6 space. Here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord. I slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm Cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord. This necessitated undercutting the bodies of both C5 and C6 extensively, but I was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord. I exposed the C6 root and widely decompressed it until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right. The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved. Attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis. A high-speed Cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of C5-C6, C4-C5 and C3-C4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration. Bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use. Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis. Using the various Synthes sizers, I selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at C5-C6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at C4-C5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at C3-C4. Each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge. I decided to use BMP in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks. The BMP sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft. Under distraction, the graft was placed at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 as described. An x-ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis. Attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation. Various sizes of Synthes plates were selected until I decided that a 54-mm plate was appropriate. The plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush. The holes were drilled and the screws were placed. Eight screws were placed with two screws at C3, two screws at C4, two screws at C5, and two screws at C6. All eight screws had good purchase. The locking screws were tightly applied. An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws. Attention was turned to closure. The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained. A medium Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin. The wound was then carefully closed in layers. Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition. The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct. There were no intraoperative complications. Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue.",

Attached a metal plate from C3 to C6 with screws (Synthes Small Stature Plate) using a microscope and careful tissue handling.  \n\n**Why the surgery was done**  \nThe patient, 62 years old, had severe neck bone disease that was pressing on his spinal cord and nerves. The disc at C4‑C5 was bulging and also pressing on nerves, causing pain in his arm. Pain in the neck came from the C3‑C4 area, confirmed by pain‑relieving injections. After discussing the risks and benefits of fixing two levels versus three levels, the patient chose to have surgery on all three levels (C3‑C4, C4‑C5, C5‑C6). He understood the procedure and its risks and gave permission to proceed.  \n\n**Surgery details**  \nThe patient was positioned on the operating table, intubated, and his neck was kept straight. Steroids were given to protect the spinal cord. The left side of his neck was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A horizontal cut was made in the neck crease, and the tissue was cut back through the platysma muscle to expose the front of the spine. The longus colli muscle was freed from the spine. Pins (Caspar pins) were placed into the vertebrae at C3, C4, C5, and C6, and X‑ray images confirmed the correct positions.  \n\nA needle was used to confirm the disc space at C4‑C5. Retractors were placed to keep the wound open, carefully staying under the longus colli muscle.  \n\nThe surgeon first removed large bone spurs that were sticking out at C5‑C6 and pulled the vertebrae apart. A high‑speed drill was used to shave the spurs back toward the back of the vertebrae. Then the disc at C4‑C5 was cut open and removed back to the back of the vertebrae. The same was done at C3‑C4.  \n\nUnder a microscope, the surgeon worked from C3‑C4 down to the posterior longitudinal ligament (a tough band on the back of the vertebrae). The ligament was cut, exposing the dura (the covering of the spinal cord). The surgeon widened the opening for the C4 nerve root on both sides, taking care not to cut many veins that were bleeding. The nerve root was felt along the pedicle into the foramen and was widely opened on the right side. The microscope was then angled to the left side to do the same.  \n\nAt C4‑C5, the surgeon cut through bone spurs, opened the ligament, and removed bulging disc material in large pieces. The C5 nerve root was exposed and widely opened on both sides. The surgeon also removed a moderate amount of spinal cord compression by gently shaving the bone with 1‑ and 2‑mm punches.  \n\nAt C5‑C6, large bone spurs were pressing on the spinal cord. The surgeon used a high‑speed drill and 1‑ and 2‑mm punches to remove the spurs and relieve the cord. This required shaving the bodies of C5 and C6, but the cord was then well decompressed. The C6 nerve root was widened on both sides.  \n\nNext, the surgeon prepared the vertebrae for fusion. A high‑speed drill (Cornerstone bur) was used to create a small shelf on the back of the vertebrae at C5‑C6, C4‑C5, and C3‑C4 to keep the graft from moving backward. Bone dust from the drilling was saved for later use.  \n\nThree bone grafts were chosen: a 7‑mm lordotic graft for C5‑C6, an 8‑mm lordotic graft for C4‑C5, and a 9‑mm lordotic graft for C3‑C4. Each graft was packed with the patient’s own bone and a sponge soaked in bone‑growth protein (BMP). BMP was used because the patient was a heavy smoker who had quit only two weeks earlier and because three levels were being fused. The grafts were placed in the disc spaces while the vertebrae were gently pulled apart. An X‑ray confirmed good placement and that the natural neck curve (lordosis) was preserved.  \n\nThe metal plate (Synthes Small Stature Plate) was chosen to be 54 mm long. It was bent slightly downward and the vertebrae were drilled so the plate would sit flush. Eight screws were inserted: two at each of C3, C4, C5, and C6. All screws had good purchase, and the locking screws were tightened. An X‑ray confirmed proper placement of the graft, plate, and screws.  \n\nFor closure, the wound was washed thoroughly with a Bacitracin solution and bleeding was stopped carefully. A medium‑size Hemovac drain was placed in the space in front of the vertebrae and brought out through a small separate incision. The wound was closed in layers, covered with sterile dressings, and the operation was finished.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the surgery well, had no complications during the operation, and was sent to the recovery room in good condition. All counts (sponges, needles) were correct, and the removed disc, bone, and soft tissue were sent for pathology."
