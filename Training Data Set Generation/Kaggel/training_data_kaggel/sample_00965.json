  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral inguinal hernias with bilateral hydroceles after right inguinal hernia repair, cerebral palsy, asthma, seizure disorder, developmental delay, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles, and right torsed appendix testis. PROCEDURE: Right inguinal exploration, left inguinal hernia repair, bilateral hydrocele repair, and excision of right appendix testis. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 700 mL of crystalloid. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. SPECIMENS: Tissue sent to pathology is calcified right appendix testis. TUBES/DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. COUNTS: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic and 0.25% Marcaine ilioinguinal nerve block, 30 mL given per surgeon. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 14-1/2-year-old boy with multiple medical problems, primarily due to cerebral palsy, asthma, seizures, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and developmental delay. He had a hernia repair done on the right in the past, but developed a new hernia on the right and a smaller on the left. The plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in the supine position. IV antibiotics were given. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. A right inguinal incision was made in the previous incisional site with a 15-blade knife, extended down through the subcutaneous tissue and Scarpa fascia with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised. There was a moderate amount of scar tissue noted, but we were able to incise that and go down into the right inguinal canal. Upon dissection there, we did not find any hernias; however, he did have a fairly sizable hydrocele. We went down towards the external ring and found that this was indeed tight without any hernias. We then closed up the external oblique fascia and made an incision after doing a shave on the right and left scrotum into the upper scrotal sac with a curvilinear incision with a 15-blade knife. We then extended down to the subcutaneous tissue. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The hydrocele sac was visualized and then drained after incising into it with a curved Metzenbaum scissors. The testis was then delivered and found to have a moderate amount of scar tissue with a calcified appendix testis, which was then excised and sent to pathology. We then checked the upper aspect of the tunica vaginalis pouch and found that there was indeed no other connection, was up above, so we then wrapped the sac around the back of the testis, and closed it with a 4-0 chromic suture in a Lord maneuver. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic and placed the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation. We then used an ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation on both incisional areas with 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine; 15 mL was given. We performed a similar procedure on the left, incising it at the scrotal area first, rather than below, and found this tunica vaginalis, and dissected it in a similar fashion and cauterized the appendix testis, which was not torsed. This was a smaller hydrocele, but because of the __________ shunt, we went up above and found that there was a very small connection, which was then dissected off the cord structures gently, twisted upon itself, suture ligated with a 2-0 Vicryl suture. The ilioinguinal nerve block and other wound instillations again with 15 mL total of 0.25% Marcaine were then done by the surgeon as well. The external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 2-0 Vicryl. 4-0 chromic was then used to close the Scarpa fascia. The skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. The scrotal incisions were closed with a subcutaneous and dartos closure using 4-0 chromic. IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on all 4 incisions. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses**  \nThe boy has:  \n- Hernias on both sides of the groin with fluid collections (hydroceles) on both sides after a previous right‑groin hernia repair.  \n- Cerebral palsy, asthma, seizures, developmental delay, and acid reflux.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \n- Left‑groin hernia, fluid collections on both sides, and a twisted right testicular appendix.  \n\n**Procedure**  \nThe surgeon performed:  \n- A look into the right groin, repair of the left groin hernia, repair of the fluid collections on both sides, and removal of the twisted right testicular appendix.  \n\n**Fluids**  \n- 700 mL of crystalloid fluid was given.  \n\n**Blood loss**  \n- About 10 mL.  \n\n**Specimens**  \n- The removed right testicular appendix was sent to pathology and was calcified.  \n\n**Tubes or drains**  \n- None were used.  \n\n**Counts**  \n- All sponges and needles were counted correctly.  \n\n**Anesthesia**  \n- General inhaled anesthesia plus a 0.25% Marcaine nerve block of the ilioinguinal nerve (30 mL total).  \n\n**Indications for surgery**  \nThe 14½‑year‑old boy has many medical problems mainly from cerebral palsy, asthma, seizures, reflux, and developmental delay. He had a right‑groin hernia repair before, but now has a new right hernia and a smaller left one. Surgery was planned to fix these problems.  \n\n**Description of the operation**  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room, checked for correct patient, site, and consent. He was put under general anesthesia and laid on his back. Antibiotics were given through an IV. The surgical area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nA right‑groin incision was made at the old scar site, cut through the skin, fat, and Scarpa fascia with a 15‑blade knife and cautery. The external oblique muscle fascia was cut open. Scar tissue was seen but was cut through to reach the right groin canal. No hernia was found there, but a large fluid collection (hydrocele) was present. The surgeon went to the external ring, confirmed it was tight and had no hernia, then closed the external oblique fascia.  \n\nThe surgeon then made a curved incision on the upper part of the right and left scrotum, cut through the skin and fat, and used cautery to stop bleeding. The hydrocele sac was seen and opened with curved scissors. The testis was pulled out and had scar tissue and a calcified testicular appendix, which was removed and sent to pathology. The surgeon checked the upper part of the tunica vaginalis (the sac around the testis) and found no other connections. The sac was wrapped around the back of the testis and closed with a 4‑0 chromic suture in a “Lord” technique. The upper part of the subdartos pouch was closed with a purse‑string 4‑0 chromic suture, and the testis was placed back into the scrotum in the correct position.  \n\nA nerve block and wound soak with 0.25% Marcaine (no epinephrine) were given on both incision sites (15 mL total).  \n\nThe left side was treated similarly. The incision was made on the scrotum first, then the tunica vaginalis was dissected and the non‑torsed testicular appendix was cauterized. The left hydrocele was smaller. Because of a small connection to the cord, the surgeon carefully separated it, twisted it, and tied it off with a 2‑0 Vicryl suture. The nerve block and wound soak were repeated (15 mL total).  \n\nThe external oblique fascia on both sides was closed with a running 2‑0 Vicryl suture. Scarpa fascia was closed with 4‑0 chromic. The skin was closed with a 4‑0 Rapide subcuticular stitch. The scrotal incisions were closed with subcutaneous and dartos layers using 4‑0 chromic. An IV dose of Toradol was given at the end. Dermabond adhesive was applied to all four incisions.  \n\nThe boy tolerated the surgery well and was stable when moved to recovery."
