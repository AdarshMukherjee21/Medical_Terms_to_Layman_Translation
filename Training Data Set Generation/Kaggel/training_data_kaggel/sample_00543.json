  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penile skin bridges after circumcision. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penile skin bridges after circumcision. PROCEDURE: Excision of penile skin bridges about 2 cm in size. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Same as above. ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMENS: No tissue sent to Pathology. TUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. COUNT: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old boy with a history of newborn circumcision who developed multiple skin bridges after circumcision causing curvature with erection. Plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient is taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, the caudal block was placed and IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Once he was prepped and draped, we used a straight mosquito clamp and went under the bridges and crushed them, and then excised them with a curved iris and curved tenotomy scissors. We removed the excessive skin on the shaft skin and on the glans itself. We then on the ventrum excised the bridge and did a Heinecke-Mikulicz closure with interrupted figure-of-eight and interrupted suture of 5-0 chromic. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Once this was done, we then used Dermabond tissue adhesive and Surgicel to prevent the bridges from returning again. IV Toradol was given at the end of procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The boy had skin bridges on his penis after a circumcision.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as before.  \n\nPROCEDURE: The surgeon cut out the skin bridges, which were about 2 cm long.  \n\nABNORMAL FINDINGS: Same as above.  \n\nANESTHESIA: The child was given general inhaled anesthesia and a caudal block (a local block near the spine).  \n\nFLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloid fluid was given.  \n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.  \n\nSPECIMENS: No tissue was sent to pathology.  \n\nTUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used.  \n\nCOUNT: Sponge and needle counts were correct twice.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: A 2‑year‑and‑3‑month‑old boy who had a circumcision as a newborn now has several skin bridges that cause his penis to curve when he is erect. Surgery was planned to fix this.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room, and the surgical team confirmed his identity and the surgical site. After anesthesia was started, a caudal block was placed and IV antibiotics were given. He was laid flat on his back, and the area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Using a straight mosquito clamp, the surgeon went under the skin bridges and crushed them. Then the bridges were cut out with a curved iris and curved tenotomy scissors. Extra skin on the shaft and on the glans was removed. On the underside of the penis, the bridge was cut out and closed with a Heinecke‑Mikulicz technique, using figure‑of‑eight and simple interrupted stitches of 5‑0 chromic suture. Electrocautery was used to stop bleeding. After the wound was closed, Dermabond tissue adhesive and Surgicel were applied to help prevent the bridges from forming again. IV Toradol was given at the end of the surgery. The boy tolerated the procedure well and was stable when moved to the recovery room."
