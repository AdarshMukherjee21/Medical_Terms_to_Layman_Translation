  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Right inguinal hernia repair. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This patient is a 9-year-old boy with a history of intermittent swelling of the right inguinal area consistent with a right inguinal hernia. The patient is being taken to the operating room for inguinal hernia repair. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient's inguinal and scrotal area were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An incision was made in the right inguinal skin crease. The incision was taken down to the level of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, which was incised up to the level of the external ring. The hernia sac was verified and dissected at the level of the internal ring and a high ligation performed. The distal remnant was taken to its end and excised. The testicle and cord structures were placed back in their native positions. The aponeurosis of the external oblique was reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl as well as the Scarpa's, the skin closed with 5-0 Monocryl and dressed with Steri-Strips. The patient was extubated in the operating room and taken back to the recovery room. The patient tolerated the procedure well.",

He is having surgery to fix it.\n\n**What was done during the surgery:**  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room, laid on his back, and given general anesthesia through a breathing tube. The area around his right groin and scrotum was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A small cut was made along the natural crease of the right groin. The surgeon went down to the muscle layer (aponeurosis of the external oblique) and cut it up to the level of the external ring. The hernia sac was found and carefully separated at the internal ring. The sac was tied off high and cut away. The testicle and its supporting structures were put back in their normal places. The muscle layer was stitched back together with 3‑0 Vicryl, the deeper Scarpa’s fascia was also stitched, and the skin was closed with 5‑0 Monocryl. The wound was covered with Steri‑Strips. The boy was taken out of anesthesia in the operating room and sent to recovery. He tolerated the surgery well."
