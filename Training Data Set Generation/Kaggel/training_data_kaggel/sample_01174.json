  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Circumcision. PRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Normal male phallus. POST-PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Normal male phallus. ANESTHESIA: 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. INDICATIONS: The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the parents. The risks are infection, hemorrhage, and meatal stenosis. The benefits are ease of care and cleanliness and fewer urinary tract infections. The parents understand this and have signed a permit. FINDINGS: The infant is without evidence of hypospadias or chordee prior to the procedure. TECHNIQUE: The infant was given a dorsal penile block with 1% lidocaine without epinephrine using a tuberculin syringe and 0.5 cc of lidocaine was delivered subcutaneously at 10:30 and at 1:30 o'clock at the dorsal base of the penis. The infant was prepped then with Betadine and draped with a sterile towel in the usual manner. Clamps were placed at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock and the adhesions between the glans and mucosa were instrumentally lysed. Dorsal hemostasis was established and a dorsal slit was made. The foreskin was fully retracted and remaining adhesions between the glans and mucosa were manually lysed. The infant was fitted with a XX-cm Plastibell. The foreskin was retracted around the Plastibell and circumferential hemostasis was established. The excess foreskin was removed with scissors and the infant tolerated the procedure well with a minimum amount of blood loss. Instructions for continuing care are to watch for any evidence of hemorrhage or urination and the parents are instructed in the care of the circumcised penis.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Circumcision  \n**Before the procedure:** The baby’s penis looked normal.  \n**After the procedure:** The baby’s penis still looks normal.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** 1% lidocaine (no epinephrine).  \n\n**Why the procedure was done:**  \nThe parents were told about the risks (infection, bleeding, narrowing of the urinary opening) and the benefits (easier cleaning, fewer urinary infections). They understood and signed permission.  \n\n**What was found:** No problems like hypospadias or chordee were seen before the surgery.  \n\n**How it was done:**  \n1. The baby received a local block on the back of the penis with 0.5 cc of lidocaine at two spots (10:30 and 1:30).  \n2. The area was cleaned with Betadine and covered with a sterile towel.  \n3. Clamps were placed at the 10‑ and 2‑o’clock positions and the tissue sticking the foreskin to the head of the penis was cut away.  \n4. Bleeding was stopped on the back of the penis and a small cut (slit) was made.  \n5. The foreskin was pulled back and any remaining stuck tissue was cut by hand.  \n6. A Plastibell ring (size XX cm) was fitted. The foreskin was pulled over the ring and bleeding was stopped around the ring.  \n7. The extra foreskin was cut off with scissors.  \n8. The baby had very little blood loss and tolerated the procedure well.  \n\n**Aftercare:** Watch for bleeding or problems with urination. The parents were taught how to care for the baby’s new circumcised penis."
