  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Open carpal tunnel release. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and general anesthesia the Left upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was made in line with the 4th ray. The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis, which was cut. The distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat. The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat. The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with scissors. After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the skin was repaired with 4-0 nylon interrupted stitches. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound, which was then dressed and splinted. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",

The left arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. Blood was removed from the arm with an Esmarch bandage and a tourniquet was set to 250 mmHg. A straight cut was made along the line of the fourth finger. The surgeon went down to the thin sheet of tissue (aponeurosis) and cut it. The edge of the transverse carpal ligament was found with a clamp. The clamp was carefully placed under the ligament to keep the contents of the carpal tunnel safe, and the ligament was cut on its side toward the little finger with a knife right onto the clamp. The forearm fascia was cut up close to the skin with scissors. The wound was washed thoroughly with normal saline. The skin was stitched together with 4‑0 nylon stitches. A local anesthetic (Marcaine) with epinephrine was injected into the wound, then it was covered and a splint was applied. The patient went to recovery in good condition and tolerated the surgery well."
