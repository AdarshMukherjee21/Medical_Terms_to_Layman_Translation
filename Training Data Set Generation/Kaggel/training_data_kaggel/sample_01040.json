  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT SHOULDER CLINICAL:This is a 51-year-old female with left shoulder pain and restricted external rotation and abduction x 6 months. Received for second opinion. Study performed on 10/04/05. FINDINGS: The patient was scanned in a 1.5 Tesla magnet. There is a flat undersurface of the acromion (Type I) morphology, with anterior downsloping orientation. There is inflammation of the anterior rotator interval capsule with peritendinous edema involving the intracapsular long biceps tendon best appreciated on the (axial gradient echo T2 series #3 images #6-9). There is edema with thickening of the superior glenohumeral ligament (axial T2 series #3 image #7). There is flattening of the long biceps tendon as it enters the bicipital groove (axial T2 series #3 image #9-10), but no subluxation. The findings suggest early changes of a hidden lesion. Normal biceps labral complex and superior labrum, and there is no demonstrated superior labral tear. There is minimal tendinitis with intratendinous edema of the insertion of the subscapularis tendon (axial T2 series #3 image #10). There is minimal fluid within the glenohumeral joint capsule within normal physiologic volume limits. Normal anterior and posterior glenoid labra. Normal supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons. Normal muscles of the rotator cuff and there is no muscular atrophy. There is minimal fluid loculated within the labral ligamentous capsular complex along the posterior-superior labrum (sagittal T2 series #7 image #5; coronal T2 series #5 image #7), but there is no demonstrated posterior-superior labral tear or paralabral cyst or ganglion. Normal acromioclavicular articulation. IMPRESSION: Inflammation of the anterior rotator interval capsule with interstitial edema of the superior glenohumeral ligament. Flattening of the long biceps tendon as it enters the bicipital groove, but no subluxation. Findings suggest early changes of a hidden lesion. Mild tendinitis of the distal insertion of the subscapularis tendon, but no tendon tear. Normal supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons and muscular complexes. Type I morphology with an anterior downsloping orientation of the acromion, but no inferior acromial osteophyte.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** MRI of the left shoulder  \n**Clinical:** A 51‑year‑old woman has had left shoulder pain and limited ability to rotate and lift her arm for 6 months. She is getting a second opinion. The scan was done on 10/04/05.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The MRI was performed on a 1.5‑Tesla machine.  \n- The underside of the acromion (part of the shoulder blade) is flat (Type I) and slopes downward toward the front.  \n- The capsule at the front of the shoulder joint (rotator interval) is inflamed, with swelling around the long biceps tendon inside the joint. This is best seen on the axial T2 images #6‑9.  \n- The superior glenohumeral ligament (a ligament that helps stabilize the shoulder) shows swelling and thickening (seen on axial T2 image #7).  \n- The long biceps tendon becomes flattened as it enters the bicipital groove, but it has not moved out of place.  \n- These changes suggest early signs of a hidden problem.  \n- The biceps labral complex and the superior labrum look normal; no tear is seen.  \n- The subscapularis tendon (one of the rotator cuff muscles) has a small amount of tendon inflammation and swelling at its attachment point (seen on axial T2 image #10).  \n- There is a small amount of fluid in the shoulder joint, within normal limits.  \n- The front and back labra of the glenoid (socket of the shoulder joint) are normal.  \n- The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons are normal.  \n- The rotator cuff muscles show no wasting.  \n- A small pocket of fluid is seen along the back‑upper part of the labrum, but there is no tear, cyst, or ganglion there.  \n- The acromioclavicular joint (where the collarbone meets the shoulder blade) is normal.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- Inflammation of the front shoulder capsule and swelling of the superior glenohumeral ligament.  \n- Flattening of the long biceps tendon as it enters the groove, but no displacement.  \n- Early signs of a hidden issue.  \n- Mild inflammation of the subscapularis tendon’s attachment, no tear.  \n- The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons and muscles are normal.  \n- The acromion is flat with a downward slope, and there is no bone spur."
