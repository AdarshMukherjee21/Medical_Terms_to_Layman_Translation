PROCEDURE: Closing wedge osteotomy, fifth metatarsal with internal screw fixation, right foot. ANESTHESIA: Local infiltrate with IV sedation. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems. The problem has been progressive in nature. The preoperative discussion with the patient included alternative treatment options, the procedure was explained, and the risk factors such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and the postoperative management were discussed. The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patient have less pain and improved function, all questions were thoroughly answered. The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interfere with normal daily activity. The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate pain and discomfort. DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The patient was given 1 g of Ancef IV for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure. The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. No tourniquet was utilized. IV sedation was achieved followed by a local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site. The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Balanced anesthesia was obtained. PROCEDURE: Closing wedge osteotomy, fifth metatarsal with internal screw fixation, right foot. A dorsal curvilinear incision was made extending from the base of the proximal phalanx fifth digit to a point 1.5 cm from the base of the fifth metatarsal. Care was taken to identify and retract all vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery. The extensor tendon was identified and retracted medially. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue down to the periosteal layer. A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision. The capsular tissue and periosteal layer was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface. Inspection of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint revealed articular cartilage to be perverse and hypertrophic changes to the lateral and dorsolateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal head. An oscillating saw was utilized to carefully resect the hypertrophic portion of the fifth metatarsal head to a more normal configuration. The both edges were rasped smooth. Attention was then focused on the fifth metatarsal. The periosteal layer proximal to the fifth metatarsal head was underscored, free from its underlying attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface. An excess guide position perpendicular to the weightbearing surface was placed to define apex of the osteotomy. Using an oscillating saw, a vertically placed, wedge-shaped oblique ostomy was made with the apex being proximal, lateral, and the base medial and distal. Generous amounts of lateral cortex were preserved for the lateral hinge. The wedge was removed from the surgical field. The fifth metatarsal was placed in the appropriate position and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then countersunk and a 3-0 x 40 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position. Good purchase was noted at the osteotomy site. Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the fourth intermetatarsal angle with the fifth metatarsal in good alignment and position. The surgical site was flushed with copious amounts of normal saline irrigation. The periosteal and capsular layers were closed with running sutures of 3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin edges were closed with 4-0 nylon in a running interrupted fashion. A dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, confirming bandages, and ACE wrap to provide mild compression was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to the recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by normal capillary refill time, and all digits were warm and pink. A walker boot was dispensed and applied. The patient should wear that all the time when standing or walking and be nonweightbearing with crutches and to clear by me. Office visit will be in 4 days. The patient was given prescriptions for Keflex 500 mg one p.o. t.i.d. for 10 days and Ultram ER, #15 one p.o. daily along with written and oral home instructions including a number on which I can be reached 24 hours a day if any problem arises. After short recuperative period, the patient was discharged home with a vital sign stable in no acute distress.",

We talked about other ways to treat the problem, explained the surgery, and discussed risks such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, ongoing pain, the chance the problem could come back, and how to care for the foot after surgery. The patient was told that most people feel less pain and can move better after this surgery, but we could not promise a cure. All questions were answered. The patient chose surgery because the bunion was interfering with daily activities and wanted relief from pain and discomfort.  \n\n**Details of the procedure:**  \n- 30 minutes before surgery, the patient received 1 g of the antibiotic Ancef IV.  \n- The patient was placed lying on their back in the operating room. No tourniquet was used.  \n- IV sedation was given, then a local anesthetic (about 10 mL of a 1:1 mix of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine) was injected near the surgical area.  \n- The leg was cleaned and covered in a sterile way.  \n\n**Surgical steps:**  \n1. A curved incision was made on the top of the foot, from the base of the fifth toe to about 1.5 cm from the base of the fifth metatarsal.  \n2. Important structures were identified and moved aside; any small vessels were cauterized if needed.  \n3. The extensor tendon was moved to the inside of the foot.  \n4. Tissue was cut through the skin, fat, and the outer bone layer (periosteum) to expose the bone.  \n5. The joint of the fifth toe was examined; the cartilage was worn and the bone head was thickened.  \n6. An oscillating saw removed the thickened part of the bone head to make it more normal. Both edges were smoothed.  \n7. The bone itself was prepared for the wedge cut. A guide was placed perpendicular to the weight‑bearing surface to mark the top of the wedge.  \n8. Using the saw, a wedge‑shaped cut was made with the tip of the wedge toward the inside of the foot and the base toward the outside. A large part of the outer bone was left to act as a hinge.  \n9. The wedge was removed. The bone was positioned correctly and held with a guide pin. A 3‑0 × 40 mm cannulated screw was then placed over the pin to lock the bone in place.  \n10. The joint angle between the fourth and fifth metatarsals looked good and the fifth metatarsal was properly aligned.  \n11. The area was washed with plenty of normal saline.  \n12. The outer layers (periosteum and capsule) were stitched closed with 3‑0 Vicryl.  \n13. The under‑skin tissue was closed with 4‑0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4‑0 nylon in a running interrupted stitch.  \n14. A dressing of Adaptic bandages and an ACE wrap was applied for mild compression.  \n\n**After the surgery:**  \nThe patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well. Vital signs were stable, and the foot had good blood flow (normal capillary refill, warm and pink toes). A walker boot was fitted. The patient should wear the boot all the time when standing or walking, use crutches, and not put weight on the foot until cleared by the surgeon.  \n\n**Follow‑up:**  \nAn office visit is scheduled in 4 days.  \n\n**Medications prescribed:**  \n- Keflex 500 mg, three times a day for 10 days.  \n- Ultram ER, one tablet daily.  \n\n**Home instructions:**  \nWritten and verbal instructions were given. The patient can call the office 24 hours a day if any problem occurs.  \n\n**Discharge:**  \nAfter a short recovery period, the patient was sent home with stable vital signs and no acute distress."
