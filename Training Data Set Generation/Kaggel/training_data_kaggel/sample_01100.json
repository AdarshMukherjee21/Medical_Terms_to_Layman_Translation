  "medical": "EXAM: Left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and StarClose closure of right common femoral artery. REASON FOR EXAM: Abnormal stress test and episode of shortness of breath. PROCEDURE: Right common femoral artery, 6-French sheath, JL4, JR4, and pigtail catheters were used. FINDINGS: 1. Left main is a large-caliber vessel. It is angiographically free of disease, 2. LAD is a large-caliber vessel. It gives rise to two diagonals and septal perforator. It erupts around the apex. LAD shows an area of 60% to 70% stenosis probably in its mid portion. The lesion is a type A finishing before the takeoff of diagonal 1. The rest of the vessel is angiographically free of disease. 3. Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 are angiographically free of disease. 4. Left circumflex is a small-to-moderate caliber vessel, gives rise to 1 OM. It is angiographically free of disease. 5. OM-1 is angiographically free of disease. 6. RCA is a large, dominant vessel, gives rise to conus, RV marginal, PDA and one PL. RCA has a tortuous course and it has a 30% to 40% stenosis in its proximal portion. 7. LVEDP is measured 40 mmHg. 8. No gradient between LV and aorta is noted. Due to contrast concern due to renal function, no LV gram was performed. Following this, right common femoral angiogram was performed followed by StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery. IMPRESSION: 1. 60% to 70% mid left anterior descending stenosis. 2. Mild 30% to 40% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery. 3. Status post StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery. PLAN: Plan will be to perform elective PCI of the mid LAD.",
  "layman": "EXAM: A left heart catheterization, a selective coronary angiogram, a right common femoral artery angiogram, and a StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.  \n\nREASON FOR EXAM: An abnormal stress test and a recent episode of shortness of breath.  \n\nPROCEDURE: A 6‑French sheath was inserted into the right common femoral artery. JL4, JR4, and pigtail catheters were used.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n1. The left main coronary artery is a large vessel and shows no disease.  \n2. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery is large. It gives off two diagonal branches and a septal perforator and runs toward the heart’s apex. The LAD has a 60% to 70% narrowing, probably in its middle part, before the first diagonal branch. The rest of the LAD is clear.  \n3. Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 are clear.  \n4. The left circumflex artery is small to medium in size, gives off one obtuse marginal branch, and is clear.  \n5. The obtuse marginal branch is clear.  \n6. The right coronary artery (RCA) is large and dominant. It gives off a conus branch, a right ventricular marginal branch, a posterior descending artery, and one posterolateral branch. The RCA is twisted and has a 30% to 40% narrowing near its beginning.  \n7. The left ventricular end‑diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was 40 mmHg.  \n8. There was no pressure difference between the left ventricle and the aorta. Because of concerns about kidney function, no left ventricular angiogram was done. After this, a right femoral artery angiogram was performed and the artery was closed with a StarClose device.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. A 60% to 70% narrowing in the middle of the LAD.  \n2. A mild 30% to 40% narrowing in the beginning of the RCA.  \n3. The right femoral artery was successfully closed with StarClose.  \n\nPLAN: The next step is to plan an elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to open the narrowed part of the LAD."
