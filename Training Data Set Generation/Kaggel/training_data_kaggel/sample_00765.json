  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. PROCEDURE: Exploratory laparotomy and drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with control of leakage. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General oroendotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE: After adequate general anesthesia was administered, the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically. Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact. The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: A leak at the connection between the esophagus and stomach after surgery.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same leak.  \nPROCEDURE: Open the abdomen to find and drain any pus collections and stop the leak.  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with a breathing tube.  \n\nAfter the patient was fully anesthetized, the belly was cleaned and covered. Old stitches and staples were taken out. The belly was opened. A few early scar tissues were easy to separate. The surgeon moved up toward the upper belly and found the colon was stuck down and full of stool. The colon was pulled down to see the stomach. There were several scar tissues around the stomach, which were carefully cut away to expose the area where the stomach was closed after the previous surgery. It looked like it might be leaking, but it was actually closed. The pyloroplasty (a small opening in the stomach) was also intact and not leaking.  \n\nFurther up toward the diaphragm, a pus pocket was found. It was sent for testing, drained, and cleaned. The pocket followed the path up to the diaphragm. The stomach looked healthy with no dead tissue. The top part of the stomach was also healthy. The surgeon did not pull the stomach and esophagus back into the belly from the chest. Instead, a suction tube was put into the chest area where more cloudy fluid was found. A 10‑mm flat drain was carefully placed through the diaphragm into the chest to control the leaking area. Two more drains were put through the tissue between the stomach and liver, where most of the drainage had gathered. The surgeon had talked with Dr. Sageman and decided that moving the stomach to redo the connection in the chest would not be safe for the patient, so no attempt was made to repair the connection.  \n\nAfter the drains were in place, they were brought out through the belly wall and tied with 3‑0 silk stitches and attached to suction. The belly’s middle layer was closed with running #2 Prolene stitches and extra support stitches. The tissue under the skin was washed thoroughly, and the skin was closed loosely with staples. A dry gauze dressing was applied. The patient had no problems during the operation."
