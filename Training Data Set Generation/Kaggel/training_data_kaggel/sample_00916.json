  "medical": "Twin pregnancy with threatened preterm labor. GENERAL EVALUATION: (Twin A) Fetal Cardiac Activity: Normal at 166 BPM Fetal Lie: Twin A lies to the maternal left. Fetal Presentation: Cephalic Placenta: Posterior fused placenta Grade I-II Uterus: Normal Cervix: Closed Adnexa: Not seen Amniotic Fluid: There is a single 3.9cm anterior pocket. BIOMETRY: BPD: 8.7cm consistent with 35 weeks, 1 day HC: 30.3cm consistent with 33 weeks, 5 days. AC: 28.2cm consistent with 32 weeks, 1 day FL: 6.2cm consistent with 32 weeks 1 day CI (BPD/OFD): 85 (70-86) FL/BPD: 71 (71-87) FL/HC: 20.5 (19.9-21.5) FL/AC 22 (20-24) HC/AC: 1.07 (0.96-1.11).

Fetal Abdominal Wall: Normal Fetal Spine: Normal Fetal Kidneys: Normal Fetal Bladder: Normal Fetal Limbs: Normal IMPRESSION: Monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy. Twin A is small for gestational age but equal to twin B (size and dates is detailed above). Nuchal cord. Low amniotic fluid volume. ADDENDUM: TWIN B After further communication with the ultrasound technologist, the small pocket of anterior fluid is only a small portion of the volume of amniotic fluid for the twin. Although AFI could not be determined, the single pocket meets criteria for normal amniotic fluid.",
  "layman": "Twin pregnancy with a risk of early labor.  \n\n**General Findings**  \n- **Twin A**:  \n  - Heart rate is normal at 166 beats per minute.  \n  - The baby is positioned on the mother’s left side.  \n  - Head is up (cephalic).  \n  - The placenta is behind the uterus and is fused, grade I–II.  \n  - Uterus and cervix look normal; cervix is closed.  \n  - No extra structures seen.  \n  - Amniotic fluid: one clear pocket 3.9 cm in front.  \n\n**Measurements**  \n- Biparietal diameter (BPD): 8.7 cm → about 35 weeks + 1 day.  \n- Head circumference (HC): 30.3 cm → about 33 weeks + 5 days.  \n- Abdominal circumference (AC): 28.2 cm → about 32 weeks + 1 day.  \n- Femur length (FL): 6.2 cm → about 32 weeks + 1 day.  \n\n**Ratios** (normal ranges shown in brackets)  \n- BPD/OFD: 85 (70‑86)  \n- FL/BPD: 71 (71‑87)  \n- FL/HC: 20.5 (19.9‑21.5)  \n- FL/AC: 22 (20‑24)  \n- HC/AC: 1.07 (0.96‑1.11)  \n\n**Gestational Age**  \n- By current ultrasound: 33 weeks + 2 days (± 2 weeks + 2 days).  \n- By dates: 35 weeks + 5 days.  \n- Previous ultrasound (4/20/07): 35 weeks + 2 days.  \n\n**Estimated Delivery Date (EDD)**  \n- By current ultrasound: July 28, 2007.  \n- By dates: July 11, 2007.  \n- By previous ultrasound: July 13, 2007.  \n\n**Anatomy**  \nAll major organs and structures look normal: heart, brain, skull, face, diaphragm, stomach, cord (three vessels, with a nuchal cord), abdominal wall, spine, kidneys, bladder, and limbs.  \n\n**Impression**  \n- Twins share one placenta but have two separate amniotic sacs (monochorionic diamniotic).  \n- Twin A is smaller than average for its age but is the same size as Twin B.  \n- There is a nuchal cord (cord around the neck).  \n- Low amount of amniotic fluid.  \n\n**Addendum for Twin B**  \nAfter talking with the ultrasound technician, the small front pocket of fluid is only part of Twin B’s total fluid. Even though a full fluid count couldn’t be made, the single pocket meets the normal fluid criteria."
