  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy with bilateral planovalgus feet. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy with bilateral planovalgus feet. PROCEDURE: Bilateral Crawford subtalar arthrodesis with open Achilles Z-lengthening and bilateral long-leg cast. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. The patient received 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic on each side. TOURNIQUET TIME: Tourniquet time was 53 minutes on the left and 45 minutes on the right. COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. HARDWARE USED: Staple 7/8 inch x1 on each side. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 5-year-4-month-old male who presents for evaluation of feet. He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity. The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus. It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening. This was explained to the mother in detail. This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature. Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan. PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room, general anesthesia was administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. Bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh. A bump was placed underneath the left buttock. Both the extremities were then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. Attention was first turned towards the left side. Intended incision was marked on the skin. The ankle was taken through a range of motion with noted improvement in the reduction of the talocalcaneal alignment with the foot in plantar flexion on the lateral view. The foot was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 200 mmHg. Incision was then made over the left lateral aspect of the hind foot to expose the talocalcaneal joint. The sinus tarsi was then identified using a U-shaped flap to tack muscles, and periosteum was retracted distally. Once the foot was reduced a Steinman pin was used to hold it in position. This position was first checked on the fluoroscopy. The 7/8th inch staple was then placed across the sinus tarsi to maintain the reduction. This was also checked with fluoroscopy. The incision was then extended posteriorly to allow for visualization of the Achilles, which was Z-lengthened with the release of the lateral distal half. This was sutured using 2-0 Ethibond and that was also oversewn. The wound was irrigated with normal saline. The periosteal flap was sutured over the staple using 2-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed using 2-0 Vicryl interrupted and then with 4-0 Monocryl. The area was injected with 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic. The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s and Webril. Tourniquet was released after 53 minutes. The exact same procedure was repeated on the right side with no changes or complications. Tourniquet time on the right side was 45 minutes. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Bilateral long-leg casts were then placed with the foot in neutral with some moulding of his medial plantar arch. The patient was subsequently was taken to Recovery in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be hospitalized overnight for pain as per parents' request. The patient is to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks. He is to follow up in the next 10 days for a check. We will plan of changing to short-leg casts in about 4 weeks postop.",
  "layman": "**PRE‑OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**  \nThe child has a muscle disease that started at birth (congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy) and both feet are flat and turned outward (planovalgus).\n\n**POST‑OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**  \nSame as before.\n\n**PROCEDURE**  \nSurgery on both feet to fuse the joint below the ankle (subtalar arthrodesis) and lengthen the Achilles tendon with a Z‑shaped cut. After surgery, both feet were put in long‑leg casts.\n\n**ANESTHESIA**  \nThe child was put under general anesthesia (fully asleep). On each side, 6 mL of a local anesthetic (0.25 % Marcaine) was given.\n\n**TOURNIQUET TIME**  \nLeft leg: 53 minutes; right leg: 45 minutes.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS**  \nNone during the operation.\n\n**DRAINS**  \nNone.\n\n**SPECIMENS**  \nNone.\n\n**HARDWARE USED**  \nOne 7/8‑inch staple on each side.\n\n**HISTORY AND PHYSICAL**  \nA 5‑year‑4‑month‑old boy came in because his feet hurt and were badly shaped. He also has a flexible foot condition called vertical talus. The doctors decided that fusing the joint below the ankle, possibly using his own bone, and lengthening the Achilles tendon would help. The mother was told all about the plan, the possible need for more surgery later, and the risks such as anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in feeling or movement, hardware problems, and the need to avoid putting weight on the feet for a while. She understood and agreed.\n\n**PROCEDURE NOTE**  \nThe child was taken to the operating room, laid on his back, and put under general anesthesia. He received a pre‑op antibiotic (Ancef). A tourniquet was placed on each thigh. A small cushion was put under his left buttock. Both legs were cleaned and covered. The left side was worked on first. The surgeon marked where to cut. The ankle was moved to improve the joint alignment. The foot was wrapped in a special bandage (Esmarch) before the tourniquet was tightened to 200 mmHg. A cut was made on the outside of the back of the foot to see the joint. The surgeon used a small flap to see the muscles and moved the bone tissue (periosteum) away. The joint was put back into place and a pin held it. X‑ray was used to confirm. A 7/8‑inch staple was placed across the joint to keep it aligned, checked with X‑ray. The cut was then extended toward the back to see the Achilles tendon, which was cut in a Z shape and lengthened by releasing the outer half. The tendon was stitched with 2‑0 Ethibond and reinforced. The wound was washed with normal salt water. The bone flap was stitched over the staple with 2‑0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl stitches and then with 4‑0 Monocryl. 6 mL of 0.25 % Marcaine was injected for pain relief. The wound was cleaned, dried, and covered with Steri‑Strips, Xeroform, 4×4 gauze, and Webril. The tourniquet was released after 53 minutes. The same steps were repeated on the right side with no problems. Tourniquet time was 45 minutes. The child tolerated the surgery well. Long‑leg casts were put on both feet with the toes in a neutral position and some shaping of the arch. He was taken to recovery and was stable.\n\n**POST‑OPERATIVE PLAN**  \nHe will stay in the hospital overnight for pain control, as requested by the parents. He must not put weight on his feet for at least 6 weeks. He will have a follow‑up visit in about 10 days. After about 4 weeks, the long casts will be changed to shorter ones."
