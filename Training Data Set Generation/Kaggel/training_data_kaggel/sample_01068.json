  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Flexible sigmoidoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rectal bleeding. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis. MEDICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon for a distance of 90 cm, reaching the proximal descending colon. At this point, stool occupied the lumen, preventing further passage. The colon distal to this was well cleaned out and easily visualized. The mucosa was normal throughout the regions examined. Numerous diverticula were seen. There was no blood or old blood or active bleeding. A retroflexed view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids. He tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Sigmoid and left colon diverticulosis. 2. Otherwise normal flexible sigmoidoscopy to the proximal descending colon. 3. The bleeding was most likely from a diverticulum, given the self limited but moderately severe quantity that he described. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Follow up with Dr. X as needed. 2. If there is further bleeding, a full colonoscopy is recommended.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Flexible sigmoidoscopy  \n**Before the procedure:** The patient had rectal bleeding.  \n**After the procedure:** The doctor found diverticulosis (small pouches in the colon).  \n\n**What happened during the procedure:**  \nA flexible scope was gently inserted through the rectum and moved up the colon about 90 cm, reaching the upper part of the descending colon. At that point, stool was in the way, so the scope couldn’t go further. The part of the colon beyond that was cleaned and looked clear. The lining of the colon was normal, but many diverticula (small pouches) were seen. There was no current or old bleeding. A special view of the area where the rectum meets the anus showed no hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the exam well and was sent to recovery.  \n\n**Final findings:**  \n1. Diverticulosis in the sigmoid and left colon.  \n2. The rest of the colon up to the upper descending part looked normal.  \n3. The bleeding was most likely from one of the diverticula, based on the amount the patient described.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Follow up with Dr. X as needed.  \n2. If bleeding continues, a full colonoscopy is advised."
