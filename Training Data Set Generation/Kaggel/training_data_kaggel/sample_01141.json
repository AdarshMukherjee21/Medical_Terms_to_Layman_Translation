  "medical": "EXAM: Bilateral diagnostic mammogram, left breast ultrasound and biopsy. HISTORY: 30-year-old female presents for digital bilateral mammography secondary to a soft tissue lump palpated by the patient in the upper right shoulder. The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58. Patient denies personal history of breast cancer. TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy. An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained. The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue. Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter. No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen. Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally. Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable. Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder. This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow. This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma. Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter. At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy. The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast. Informed consent was obtained. The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance. The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia. Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion. A small skin nick was made. Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides. The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device. The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture. Two core biopsies were obtained. The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma. Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site. A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage. Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved. Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter. The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast. The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints. The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage. The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis. IMPRESSION: 1. A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained. Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma. Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved. The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition. The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis. 2. Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma. 3. Suspicious mammographic findings. The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied. Further pathologic analysis is pending. BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings. MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION: 1. A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography. 2. Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present. 3. These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.",
  "layman": "**EXAM**: Bilateral digital mammogram, ultrasound of the left breast, and a biopsy.  \n\n**HISTORY**: A 30‑year‑old woman came in for a digital mammogram because she felt a lump in the upper right shoulder. Her mother had breast cancer at age 58. The patient has never had breast cancer herself.  \n\n**TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS**  \n- Two standard views (craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique) of both breasts were taken on mm/dd/yy.  \n- An extra side‑to‑side view of the right breast was also taken.  \n- Both breasts look dense and fibrous.  \n- In the upper outer part of the left breast, there is a clear, round spot about 1 cm by 0.7 cm.  \n- No other large masses, distorted tissue, or cancer‑type calcifications are seen.  \n- Several small, benign‑looking calcifications are seen in both breasts.  \n- The skin over both breasts looks normal.  \n\n**Ultrasound**  \n- An oval mass about 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.4 cm was found in the front‑inner part of the left shoulder. It looks the same as nearby muscle and has no blood flow inside. It could be fibrous tissue or a lipoma.  \n- Another complex solid‑and‑cystic spot with many blood vessels was seen in the left breast at the 2 o’clock position, measuring 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.8 cm. This spot was chosen for a core biopsy guided by ultrasound.  \n\n**Biopsy Procedure**  \n- The risks and possible complications were explained to the patient, and she gave written consent.  \n- The spot was located again with ultrasound. The breast was cleaned, draped, and numbed with 2% lidocaine. Extra lidocaine with epinephrine was used around the spot.  \n- A small cut was made in the skin. Doppler ultrasound showed many vessels around the spot.  \n- Using an 11‑gauge Mammotome needle, the device was guided into the spot from the side. Two core samples were taken.  \n- A third sample showed a growing dark area around the spot, indicating a rapidly expanding bruise (hematoma). Blood was seen leaving the needle site. A clip could not be placed because of the bleeding.  \n- The needle was removed, and direct pressure was applied for about 20 minutes until the bleeding stopped.  \n- After the procedure, imaging showed a bruise about 1.9 × 4.4 × 1.3 cm.  \n- The breast was cleaned again, a pressure bandage and ice pack were applied.  \n- The patient stayed in the ultrasound room for 30 minutes, had no complaints, and was then sent home with instructions on using the ice pack.  \n- The tissue samples were sent to pathology.  \n\n**IMPRESSION**  \n1. A mixed solid‑and‑cystic spot at the 2 o’clock position of the left breast was biopsied with a Mammotome needle. A small arterial bleed caused a 4 cm bruise. Pressure stopped the bleeding. The patient was monitored for 30 minutes and left the hospital in good condition. The samples are awaiting pathology results.  \n2. The small oval spot in the front‑inner left shoulder shows no blood flow and likely represents fibrous tissue or a lipoma.  \n3. The mammogram shows a suspicious round spot about 8 mm at the 2 o’clock position of the left breast, which was biopsied. Pathology results are pending.  \n**BIRADS Classification**: 4 – Suspicious findings.  \n\n**MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION**  \n1. About 10–15 % of cancers may not be seen on a mammogram.  \n2. If a lump feels suspicious, a biopsy should not be delayed even if the mammogram looks normal.  \n3. These images were taken with FDA‑approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was used."
