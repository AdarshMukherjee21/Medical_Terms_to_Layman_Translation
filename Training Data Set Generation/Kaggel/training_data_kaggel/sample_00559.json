  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. REASON FOR PROCEDURE: The child with history of irritability and diarrhea with gastroesophageal reflux. Rule out reflux esophagitis, allergic enteritis, and ulcer disease, as well as celiac disease. He has been on Prevacid 7.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. with suboptimal control of this irritability. Consent history and physical examinations were performed. The procedure, indications, alternatives available, and complications i.e. bleeding, perforation, infection, adverse medication reactions, possible need for blood transfusion, and surgery associated complication occur were discussed with the mother who understood and indicated this. Opportunity for questions was provided and informed consent was obtained. MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia. INSTRUMENT: Olympus GIF-XQ 160. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FINDINGS: With the patient in the supine position intubated under general anesthesia, the endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx. The proximal, mid, and distal esophagus had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern. Lower esophageal sphincter appeared normal and was located at 25 cm from the central incisors. A Z-line was identified within the lower esophageal sphincter. The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air. The rugal folds flattened completely. The gastric mucosa was entirely normal. No hiatal hernia was seen and the pyloric valve appeared normal. The endoscope was advanced into first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern. Ampule of Vater was identified and found to be normal. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of duodenum, antrum, and distal esophagus at 22 cm from the central incisors for histology. Additional two antral biopsies were obtained for CLO testing. Excess air was evacuated from the stomach. The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition. IMPRESSION: Normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. PLAN: Histologic evaluation and CLO testing. Continue Prevacid 7.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. I will contact the parents next week with biopsy results and further management plans will be discussed at that time.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** An upper endoscopy with biopsy.  \n**Reason for the procedure:** The child has been irritable and has diarrhea, and also has gastroesophageal reflux. The doctor wants to check for reflux esophagitis, allergic inflammation of the intestines, ulcers, and celiac disease. The child has been taking Prevacid 7.5 mg twice a day, but the symptoms have not improved well. The doctor explained the procedure, other options, and possible risks (bleeding, perforation, infection, medication reactions, need for a blood transfusion, or surgery) to the mother. She asked questions, understood the information, and gave her consent.  \n\n**Medications used:** General anesthesia.  \n**Equipment:** Olympus GIF‑XQ 160 endoscope.  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n**Estimated blood loss:** Less than 5 mL.  \n\n**Findings:**  \nThe child was lying on his back and was anesthetized. The scope was passed easily into the throat. The upper, middle, and lower parts of the esophagus looked normal, with normal color and blood vessels. The lower esophageal sphincter was normal and located 25 cm from the front teeth, with a normal Z‑line. The scope was moved into the stomach, which was full of air. The stomach folds flattened completely and the stomach lining was normal. No hiatal hernia was seen and the pyloric valve was normal. The scope was then moved into the first, second, and third parts of the duodenum, all of which looked normal. The ampulla of Vater was normal. Two biopsy samples were taken from the second part of the duodenum, the antrum, and the lower esophagus (22 cm from the front teeth) for tissue analysis. Two more antral biopsies were taken for CLO testing. Extra air was removed from the stomach. The scope was removed and the child tolerated the procedure well. He was taken to the recovery room in good condition.  \n\n**Impression:** The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum appear normal.  \n\n**Plan:** The biopsy tissue and CLO test will be examined. Continue taking Prevacid 7.5 mg twice a day. The doctor will call the parents next week with the biopsy results and discuss further steps."
