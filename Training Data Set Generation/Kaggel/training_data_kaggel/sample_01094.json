  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Dysphagia, possible stricture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastroparesis. MEDICATION: MAC. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the hypopharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The hypopharynx was normal. The esophagus had a normal upper esophageal sphincter, normal contour throughout, and a normal gastroesophageal junction viewed at 39 cm from the incisors. There was no evidence of stricturing or extrinsic narrowing from her previous hiatal hernia repair. There was no sign of reflux esophagitis. On entering the gastric lumen, a large bezoar of undigested food was seen occupying much of the gastric fundus and body. It had 2 to 3 mm diameter. This was broken up using a scope into smaller pieces. There was no retained gastric liquid. The antrum appeared normal and the pylorus was patent. The scope passed easily into the duodenum, which was normal through the second portion. On withdrawal of the scope, additional views of the cardia were obtained, and there was no evidence of any tumor or narrowing. The scope was withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal postoperative hernia repair. 2. Retained gastric contents forming a partial bezoar, suggestive of gastroparesis. 3. Otherwise normal upper endoscopy to the descending duodenum. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Continue proton pump inhibitors. 2. Use Reglan 10 mg three to four times a day.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Gastroscopy (upper endoscopy).  \n\n**Before the procedure:** The patient had trouble swallowing and a possible narrowing in the esophagus.  \n\n**After the procedure:** The diagnosis was gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying).  \n\n**Medication given:** MAC (a type of anesthesia).  \n\n**What the doctor saw:**  \n- The scope was gently passed through the throat, esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine.  \n- The throat looked normal.  \n- The upper part of the esophagus and the junction where the esophagus meets the stomach were normal, with no narrowing or signs of acid damage.  \n- In the stomach, a large piece of undigested food (a bezoar) filled most of the upper and middle parts of the stomach. It was about 2–3 mm across. The doctor broke it into smaller pieces with the scope. No liquid was left in the stomach.  \n- The lower part of the stomach and the opening to the small intestine were clear.  \n- The first two sections of the small intestine were normal.  \n- When pulling the scope back out, the opening to the stomach was checked again and no tumors or narrowing were found.  \n\n**Outcome:** The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery.  \n\n**Final diagnoses:**  \n1. The hernia repair looks normal after surgery.  \n2. Food stuck in the stomach, forming a partial bezoar, which suggests gastroparesis.  \n3. The rest of the upper endoscopy up to the descending part of the small intestine was normal.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Keep taking proton‑pump inhibitors.  \n2. Take Reglan 10 mg three to four times a day."
