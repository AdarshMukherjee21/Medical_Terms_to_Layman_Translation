  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ganglion of the left wrist. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ganglion of the left wrist. OPERATION: Excision of ganglion. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. OPERATION: After a successful anesthetic, the patient was positioned on the operating table. A tourniquet applied to the upper arm. The extremity was prepped in a usual manner for a surgical procedure and draped off. The superficial vessels were exsanguinated with an elastic wrap and the tourniquet was then inflated to the usual arm pressure. A curved incision was made over the presenting ganglion over the dorsal aspect of the wrist. By blunt and sharp dissection, it was dissected out from underneath the extensor tendons and the stalk appeared to arise from the distal radiocapitellar joint and the dorsal capsule was excised along with the ganglion and the specimen was removed and submitted. The small superficial vessels were electrocoagulated and instilled after closing the skin with 4-0 Prolene, into the area was approximately 6 to 7 mL of 0.25 Marcaine with epinephrine. A Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted and then after the tourniquet was released, it was kept deflated until at least 5 to 10 minutes had passed and then it was activated and then removed in the recovery room. The dressings applied to the hand were that of Xeroform, 4x4s, ABD, Kerlix, and elastic wrap over a volar fiberglass splint. The tourniquet was released. Circulation returned to the fingers. The patient then was allowed to awaken and left the operating room in good condition.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: A cyst (ganglion) on the left wrist.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same cyst removed from the left wrist.  \nOPERATION: The cyst was cut out.  \nANESTHESIA: General (the patient was put to sleep).  \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.\n\nProcedure:  \nAfter the anesthesia worked, the patient was put on the operating table. A tourniquet was put on the upper arm to stop blood flow. The arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. A bandage was wrapped around the arm to push blood out of the arm, then the tourniquet was tightened to the normal pressure for the arm.  \n\nA curved cut was made over the cyst on the back of the wrist. Using both blunt and sharp tools, the surgeon carefully separated the cyst from the tendons that pull the fingers. The cyst seemed to come from the joint near the wrist and the outer layer of the joint capsule. The capsule and the cyst were removed together and sent to the lab.  \n\nSmall surface blood vessels were sealed with a small electric current. The skin was stitched with 4‑0 Prolene. About 6 to 7 mL of a local anesthetic (0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine) was injected into the area. A small suction drain (Jackson‑Pratt) was put in. After the tourniquet was released, it was left off for 5 to 10 minutes, then turned on to drain fluid, and later removed in the recovery room.  \n\nDressings on the hand included Xeroform, 4×4 gauze, ABD, Kerlix, and an elastic wrap over a forearm splint. When the tourniquet was released, blood flow returned to the fingers. The patient woke up and left the operating room in good condition."
