  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Biliary colic. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Biliary colic. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. The procedure was explained to the patient and consent was obtained. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: He was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. Marcaine was injected into the umbilicus. A small incision was made. A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg and then a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed into the umbilicus. Laparoscopic examination showed no injury from entry. Marcaine was then injected just subxiphoid, and a 5-mm port was placed under direct visualization for the laparoscope. Another 5-mm port was placed just anterior to the mid-axillary line and just subcostal. The gallbladder was grasped by its infundibulum, pulled inferolaterally. The cystic duct was thereby splayed out. It was bluntly dissected, and 2 clips were placed proximally and 1 distally; and it was divided. The cystic artery was then encountered, and 2 clips were placed proximally and 1 distally; and it was divided. The gallbladder was then taken off the hepatic fossa using electrocautery and placed in an Endocatch bag and removed from the umbilicus. The fascia at the umbilicus was closed with an interrupted 0 Vicryl suture. I irrigated out the abdomen. There was no bile leak and no bleeding. The ports were then removed. The skin of all incisions was closed with a running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.",

The procedure was explained to the patient and consent was obtained.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room and laid on his back on the table. He was put under general anesthesia and a breathing tube was inserted. A local anesthetic (Marcaine) was injected around the belly button. A small cut was made. A Veress needle was used to create a small space in the abdomen. CO₂ gas was pumped in to a pressure of 15 mmHg, and a 12‑mm port (VersaStep) was placed at the belly button. A quick look with the camera showed no injury from the entry. More Marcaine was injected just below the sternum, and a 5‑mm port was placed for the laparoscope. Another 5‑mm port was put just in front of the mid‑axillary line and just below the ribs. The surgeon grabbed the gallbladder by its neck (infundibulum) and pulled it down and to the side. The cystic duct was spread out, gently cut, and two clips were placed near the top and one clip near the bottom before it was divided. The cystic artery was found next; two clips were placed near the top and one near the bottom before it was divided. The gallbladder was then separated from the liver using electrocautery, put into a bag (Endocatch), and removed through the belly‑button incision. The belly‑button opening was closed with an interrupted 0 Vicryl stitch. The abdomen was washed out. There was no bile leak and no bleeding. The ports were taken out. The skin of all incisions was closed with a running Monocryl stitch. All sponges, instruments, and needles were counted and the count was correct. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications."
