  "medical": "INTERPRETATION: MRI of the cervical spine without contrast showed normal vertebral body height and alignment with normal cervical cord signal. At C4-C5, there were minimal uncovertebral osteophytes with mild associated right foraminal compromise. At C5-C6, there were minimal diffuse disc bulge and uncovertebral osteophytes with indentation of the anterior thecal sac, but no cord deformity or foraminal compromise. At C6-C7, there was a central disc herniation resulting in mild deformity of the anterior aspect of the cord with patent neuroforamina. MRI of the thoracic spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There was evidence of disc generation, especially anteriorly at the T5-T6 level. There was no significant central canal or foraminal compromise. Thoracic cord normal in signal morphology. MRI of the lumbar spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There is disc desiccation at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis at L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4. There was a right paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 narrowing of the right lateral recess. The transversing nerve root on the right was impinged at that level. The right foramen was mildly compromised. There was also a central disc protrusion seen at the L5-S1 level resulting in indentation of the anterior thecal sac and minimal bilateral foraminal compromise. IMPRESSION: Overall impression was mild degenerative changes present in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine without high-grade central canal or foraminal narrowing. There was narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 level and associated impingement of the transversing nerve root at that level by a disc protrusion. This was also seen on a prior study.",
  "layman": "**Interpretation**\n\nThe MRI of your neck (cervical spine) was done without contrast.  \n- The bones in the neck are the right height and straight, and the spinal cord looks normal.  \n- At the level between the 4th and 5th neck bones (C4‑C5) there are very small bony growths (osteophytes) that slightly narrow the space on the right side where nerves exit.  \n- At the level between the 5th and 6th neck bones (C5‑C6) there is a small, spread‑out disc bulge and more tiny bony growths that press a little on the front of the spinal cord, but the cord itself is not deformed and the nerve exit spaces are still open.  \n- At the level between the 6th and 7th neck bones (C6‑C7) there is a central disc herniation that gently pushes on the front of the spinal cord, but the nerve exit openings (foramina) remain open.\n\nThe MRI of the upper back (thoracic spine) shows normal bone height and alignment.  \n- There is some disc degeneration, especially in front of the disc between the 5th and 6th thoracic bones (T5‑T6).  \n- The central canal and the nerve exit spaces are not significantly narrowed.  \n- The thoracic spinal cord looks normal.\n\nThe MRI of the lower back (lumbar spine) shows normal bone height and alignment.  \n- The discs at L4‑L5 and L5‑S1 are dried out (desiccated).  \n- There is no major narrowing of the central canal or nerve exit spaces at L1‑L2, L2‑L3, or L3‑L4.  \n- At L4‑L5 there is a disc that pushes out slightly to the right (right paracentral disc protrusion) and narrows the right side of the spinal canal (right lateral recess). The nerve root that runs through that space is pressed by the disc. The right nerve exit opening is mildly narrowed.  \n- At L5‑S1 there is a central disc protrusion that presses on the front of the spinal cord and slightly narrows the nerve exit openings on both sides.\n\n**Impression**\n\nYou have mild wear‑and‑tear changes in the neck, upper back, and lower back. None of the changes cause severe narrowing of the central canal or nerve exit spaces. The disc protrusion at L4‑L5 is narrowing the right side of the spinal canal and pressing on the nerve root there, which was also seen on a previous scan."
