  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Epigastric hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Epigastric hernia. OPERATIONS: Epigastric herniorrhaphy. ANESTHESIA: General inhalation. PROCEDURE: Following attainment of satisfactory anesthesia, the patient's abdomen was prepped with Hibiclens and draped sterilely. The hernia mass had been marked preoperatively. This area was anesthetized with a mixture of Marcaine and Xylocaine. A transverse incision was made over the hernia and dissection carried down to the entrapped fat. Sharp dissection was carried around the fat down to the fascial edge. The preperitoneal fat could not be reduced; therefore, it is trimmed away and the small fascial defect then closed with interrupted 0-Ethibond sutures. The fascial edges were injected with the local anesthetic mixture. Subcutaneous tissues were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl and skin edges closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Vicryl. Steri-Strips and a sterile dressing were applied to complete the closure. The patient was then awakened and taken to the PACU in satisfactory condition. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNT: Reported as correct. COMPLICATIONS: None.",

The hernia spot had been marked before surgery. The area was numbed with a mix of Marcaine and Xylocaine. A horizontal cut was made over the hernia and the surgeon worked down to the trapped fat. The fat was carefully separated from the surrounding tissue until it reached the edge of the muscle layer. The trapped fat could not be pulled back, so it was trimmed away. The small hole in the muscle was then closed with 0‑Ethibond stitches tied one at a time. The muscle edges were also given a local anesthetic injection. The under‑skin tissue was closed with 4‑0 Vicryl stitches tied one at a time, and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 4‑0 Vicryl. Steri‑Strips and a sterile dressing were applied to finish the closure. The patient woke up and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.  \n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL.  \nSPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNT: Correct.  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None."
