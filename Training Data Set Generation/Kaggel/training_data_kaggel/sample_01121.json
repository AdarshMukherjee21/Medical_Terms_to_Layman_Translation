  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Open, displaced, infected left atrophic mandibular fracture; failed dental implant. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Open, displaced, infected left atrophic mandibular fracture; failed dental implant. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left atrophic mandibular fracture, removal of failed dental implant from the left mandible. ANESTHESIA: General nasotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 125 mL. FLUIDS GIVEN: 1 L of crystalloids. SPECIMEN: Soft tissue from the fracture site sent for histologic diagnosis. CULTURES: Also sent for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic, culture and sensitivity. INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: The patient is a 79-year-old male, who fell in his hometown, following an episode of syncope. He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture. He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass. His mandible fracture was not noted initially. The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma. The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending. The patient later saw a local oral surgeon. He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston. He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago. The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty. Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position. Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion. The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures. A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible. A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible. Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis. A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site. The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound. Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis. Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site. Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site. When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically. All the screws were also locking screws. Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline. The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin. A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs. Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:**  \nThe patient had an open, displaced, and infected fracture of the left lower jaw (mandible) that was very thin (atrophic). A dental implant that had been placed 15 years earlier had failed.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:**  \nSame as pre‑operative: open, displaced, infected left jaw fracture; failed dental implant.\n\n**Procedure performed:**  \nOpen reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left jaw fracture and removal of the failed dental implant.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia with a tube inserted through the nose (nasotracheal).\n\n**Estimated blood loss:**  \n125 mL.\n\n**Fluids given:**  \n1 L of crystalloid solution.\n\n**Specimen sent for analysis:**  \nSoft tissue from the fracture site for histology.\n\n**Cultures sent:**  \nGram stain, aerobic and anaerobic cultures, and sensitivity testing.\n\n**Reason for the procedure:**  \nA 79‑year‑old man fell after fainting. He broke several ribs and also hit his jaw, causing the fracture described above. He was first taken to a hospital in Harleton, Texas, where doctors found rib fractures, a nodule on his right lung, and a mass in his chest (mediastinum). His jaw fracture was not noticed at that time. He has a history of prostate cancer and kidney cancer. He had a bronchoscopy to biopsy the chest mass; the results are still pending. Later, an oral surgeon diagnosed his jaw fracture and told him to seek treatment in Houston. He came to my office on January 18, 2010. We found his lower jaw very thin and fractured in the left front part, with a failed implant that had been in place for about 15 years. He was in pain and had trouble eating and drinking. Because of the fracture and his complex medical history, he was admitted to the hospital, cleared by a cardiologist, and scheduled for surgery today.\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. After a nasal tube was inserted and general anesthesia was started, the surgeon and staff prepared in sterile clothing. The surgical area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A marking pen outlined the incision on the underside of the chin, extending from the left to the right side of the jaw, about 1.5 cm above the lower edge of the jawbone. A small amount (1 mL) of lidocaine with epinephrine was injected along the incision line. A scalpel blade cut through the skin and fatty tissue. Sharp and blunt tools were used to lift the tissue up to the lower edge of the jawbone. Electrocautery and silk ties stopped bleeding. The periosteum (the tissue covering the bone) was cut and lifted, exposing the jawbone and the fracture. The bone was slightly pulled apart to reach the implant, which was removed easily. Cultures were taken from the site, and granulation tissue was removed and sent for histology. The jaw was moved back into its normal position, and an 11‑hole reconstruction plate (Synthes) was placed over the fracture. Because the right front part of the jaw was weak near another implant, the plate was extended behind that spot. The plate was secured with nine 2‑mm locking screws that went through both sides of the bone. The screws provided excellent stability. The wound was washed with plenty of normal saline. The incision was closed in layers: Vicryl sutures for muscle and under‑skin tissue, and nylon sutures for the skin. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the surgery well, was taken to recovery with normal breathing and stable vital signs, and the estimated blood loss was 125 mL."
