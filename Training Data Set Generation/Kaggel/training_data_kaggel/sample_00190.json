  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Bilateral direct inguinal hernia repair utilizing PHS system and placement of On-Q pain pump. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation and the abdomen and groins were prepped and draped in standard, sterile surgical fashion. I did an ilioinguinal nerve block on both sides, injecting Marcaine 1 fingerbreadth anterior and 1 fingerbreadth superior to the anterior superior iliac spine on both sides. I began on the right side by making an incision in a skin crease 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle. I dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through Scarpa's fascia. I identified the external ring and divided the external oblique up toward the anterior superior iliac spine. I located the ilioinguinal nerve and isolated it out of the wound. I encircled the cord structures and, dissecting out the cord structures, I did not visualize any sac. The floor of the inguinal canal was very loose and there was an obvious direct hernia. I cut open the floor and dissected out the preperitoneal space so I created a preperitoneal space. I took a PHS mesh system and took the posterior portion of the PHS mesh system and put it in through the hole in the floor of the inguinal canal. I made sure that it sat flat completely covering the myopectineal orifice. I then tacked the anterior part of the PHS mesh system to the pubic tubercle, superiorly to the internal oblique, inferiorly to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh and recreated the internal ring and sewed it closed, making sure it was not too tight on the cord structures. I tucked the extended portion of the mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, thereby completing the hernia repair. I placed the ilioinguinal nerve back in its anatomical position. I then closed the external obliques with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I placed on On-Q pain pump through a separate stab incision utilizing a tear-away sheath catheter. I then closed Scarpa's fascia, the subcutaneous tissue and skin with a running Monocryl. I did the exact same procedure on the opposite side. On the left side, I cut a skin incision in the skin crease above the pubic tubercle. I dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. I opened up Scarpa's fascia and identified the external ring. I opened up the external ring towards the anterior superior iliac spine. I isolated the ilioinguinal nerve so it was not damaged. I dissected out the cord and inspected the cord carefully. I did not see any sac there, but there was a weak direct floor with an obvious direct inguinal hernia. I opened the floor over this direct inguinal hernia. I cleared out the preperitoneal space and then placed the posterior portion of the PHS mesh system in place and made it lay out flat in order to cover the myopectineal orifice. I took the anterior portion of the mesh and tacked it to the pubic tubercle. I tacked the superior portion to the internal oblique, inferior portion to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in order to incorporate the cord structures and sewed it back together. I made sure this was not too tight. I then tucked the extended portion of the mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique. I returned the ilioinguinal nerve to its original position. I closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I placed an On-Q pain pump through a separate stab incision and had the catheter thread right into the wound cavity. I then closed the Scarpa's fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture. I closed the subcutaneous tissue with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture and closed the skin with running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.",

General anesthesia was given and the patient was intubated. The abdomen and groin area were cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. I performed an ilioinguinal nerve block on both sides, injecting local anesthetic just above and below the front of the hip bone.  \n\nI started on the right side. I made a small cut in a natural skin crease just above the pubic bone. I cut through the skin, fat, and a layer called Scarpa’s fascia. I found the external ring of the inguinal canal and cut the outer muscle (external oblique) toward the front of the hip bone. I located the ilioinguinal nerve and kept it out of the wound. I surrounded the spermatic cord and looked for a hernia sac, but none was seen. The floor of the canal was loose, showing a direct hernia. I cut open the floor and created a space between the abdominal wall and the peritoneum. I inserted the back part of the PHS mesh through the opening and made sure it lay flat over the myopectineal orifice. I secured the front part of the mesh to the pubic bone, the upper part to the internal oblique muscle, and the lower part to the edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh to allow the cord to pass through and stitched it closed, taking care not to tighten it too much. I tucked the extra part of the mesh under the external oblique muscle, between the external and internal oblique layers, completing the repair. I returned the ilioinguinal nerve to its normal position. I closed the external oblique muscle with a running 3‑0 Vicryl stitch. I inserted an On‑Q pain pump through a small stab incision using a tear‑away sheath catheter. I then closed Scarpa’s fascia, the fat layer, and the skin with a running Monocryl stitch. The same steps were repeated on the left side. On the left, I made a similar skin incision, dissected through the same layers, and found the external ring. I protected the ilioinguinal nerve, inspected the cord, and found a weak direct hernia. I opened the floor, cleared the preperitoneal space, and placed the back part of the mesh flat over the myopectineal orifice. I secured the front part of the mesh to the pubic bone, the upper part to the internal oblique, and the lower part to the inguinal ligament. I made a hole for the cord, stitched it closed, and tucked the extra mesh under the external oblique. I returned the nerve to its place, closed the external oblique with 3‑0 Vicryl, inserted the On‑Q pain pump through a separate stab incision, and closed Scarpa’s fascia, the fat layer, and the skin with interrupted 3‑0 Vicryl and running Monocryl stitches. All sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications."
