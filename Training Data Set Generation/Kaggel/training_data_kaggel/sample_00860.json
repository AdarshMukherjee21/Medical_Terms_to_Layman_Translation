  "medical": "REASON FOR CT SCAN: The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008. I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving. CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm. The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm. There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle. He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left. ASSESSMENT: The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0. PLAN: I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the CT scan:**  \nA 79‑year‑old man with adult hydrocephalus had a CT scan on January 16, 2008 that showed large fluid collections on both sides of his brain. The shunt setting was changed from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008. His family asked for another CT scan to see if the fluid was getting better.  \n\n**CT scan from March 11, 2008:**  \n- The front part of the brain (frontal horn) is 2.6 cm wide at the level of the foramen of Munro.  \n- The third ventricle is flat and measures 10 mm across.  \n- There is one shunt that starts on the right side of the back of the head and ends in the left side of the brain’s lateral ventricle.  \n- Fluid collections on both sides of the brain are less than 1 cm wide each, which is smaller than the January 16 scan that reported 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left.  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe fluid collections are still visible but are getting smaller with the shunt setting at 2.0.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nSchedule another head CT in about three months to decide if the setting of 2.0 should stay or if it needs to be changed."
