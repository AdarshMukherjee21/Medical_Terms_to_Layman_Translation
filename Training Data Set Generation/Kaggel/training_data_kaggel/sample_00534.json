  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bleeding after transanal excision five days ago. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bleeding after transanal excision five days ago. PROCEDURE: Exam under anesthesia with control of bleeding via cautery. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. INDICATION: The patient is a 42-year-old gentleman who is five days out from transanal excision of a benign anterior base lesion. He presents today with diarrhea and bleeding. Digital exam reveals bright red blood on the finger. He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time. FINDINGS: There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before. In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa. There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture. No other obvious bleeding was seen. TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position. After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position. His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor. The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery. There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well. This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture. At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",

He now has diarrhea and bright red bleeding. A finger exam shows fresh blood. He needs a controlled exam under anesthesia to stop the bleeding.  \n\nFINDINGS: The area where most of the growth was removed is an ulcer. The wound had almost completely opened, leaving a raw surface between the edges of the lining. A few small spots were oozing; these were treated with cautery and a #1 suture. No other obvious bleeding was seen.  \n\nTECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. After general anesthesia was started, he was moved into a slightly prone position. His buttocks were taped, cleaned, and covered with sterile drapes. A Parks anal retractor was used to expose the front wall of the rectum. The whole wound was seen by rotating the retractor a few times. Several spots along the edges were oozing and were treated with cautery. One spot in the corner was also oozing, likely because the retractor was opened wide enough to see it. This spot was closed with a 3‑0 Monocryl figure‑of‑eight suture. After the procedure, there was no bleeding or oozing; the wound was dry. The retractor was removed, the patient was turned, the breathing tube was taken out, and he was sent to recovery in stable condition."
