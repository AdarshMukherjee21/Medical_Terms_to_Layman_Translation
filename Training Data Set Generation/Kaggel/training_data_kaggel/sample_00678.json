  "medical": "CC: Sensory loss. HX: 25y/o RHF began experiencing pruritus in the RUE, above the elbow and in the right scapular region, on 10/23/92. In addition she had paresthesias in the proximal BLE and toes of the right foot. Her symptoms resolved the following day. On 10/25/92, she awoke in the morning and her legs felt &quot;asleep&quot; with decreased sensation. The sensory loss gradually progressed rostrally to the mid chest. She felt unsteady on her feet and had difficulty ambulating. In addition she also began to experience pain in the right scapular region. She denied any heat or cold intolerance, fatigue, weight loss. MEDS: None. PMH: Unremarkable. FHX: GF with CAD, otherwise unremarkable. SHX: Married, unemployed. 2 children. Patient was born and raised in Iowa. Denied any h/o Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP121/66 HR77 RR14 36.5C MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech normal with logical lucid thought process. CN: mild optic disk pallor OS. No RAPD. EOM full and smooth. No INO. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: Full strength throughout all extremities except for 5/4+ hip extensors. Normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: Decreased PP/LT below T4-5 on the left side down to the feet. Decreased PP/LT/VIB in BLE (left worse than right). Allodynic in RUE. Coord: Intact FNF, HKS and RAM, bilaterally. Station: No pronator drift. Romberg's test not documented. Gait: Unsteady wide-based. Able to TT and HW. Poor TW. Reflexes: 3/3 BUE. Hoffman's signs were present bilaterally. 4/4 patellae. 3+/3+ Achilles with 3-4 beat nonsustained clonus. Plantar responses were extensor on the right and flexor on the left. Gen. Exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, FT4, TSH, ANA, Vit B12, Folate, VDRL and Urinalysis were normal. MRI T-spine, 10/27/92, was unremarkable. MRI Brain, 10/28/92, revealed multiple areas of abnormally increased signal on T2 weighted images in the white matter regions of the right corpus callosum, periventricular region, brachium pontis and right pons. The appearance of the lesions was felt to be strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 10/28/92, Lumbar puncture revealed the following CSF results: RBC 1, WBC 9 (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), Glucose 55mg/dl, Protein 46mg/dl (normal 15-45), CSF IgG 7.5mg/dl (normal 0.0-6.2), CSF IgG index 1.3 (normal 0.0-0.7), agarose gel electrophoresis revealed oligoclonal bands in the gamma region which were not seen on the serum sample. Beta-2 microglobulin was unremarkable. An abnormal left tibial somatosensory evoked potential was noted consistent with central conduction slowing. Visual and Brainstem Auditory evoked potentials were normal. HTLV-1 titers were negative. CSF cultures and cytology were negative. She was not treated with medications as her symptoms were primarily sensory and non-debilitating, and she was discharged home. She returned on 11/7/92 as her symptoms of RUE dysesthesia, lower extremity paresthesia and weakness, all worsened. On 11/6/92, she developed slow slurred speech and had marked difficulty expressing her thoughts. She also began having difficulty emptying her bladder. Her 11/7/92 exam was notable for normal vital signs, lying motionless with eyes open and nodding and rhythmically blinking every few minutes. She was oriented to place and time of day, but not to season, day of the week and she did not know who she was. She had a leftward gaze preference and right lower facial weakness. Her RLE was spastic with sustained ankle clonus. There was dysesthetic sensory perception in the RUE. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present. MRI brain, 11/7/92, revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal region is more prominent than on prior study. The left centrum semiovale lesion has less enhancement than previously. Multiple other white matter lesions are demonstrated on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions on both sides have increased in size since the 10/92 MRI. The findings were felt more consistent with demyelinating disease and less likely glioma. Post-viral encephalitis, Rapidly progressive demyelinating disease and tumor were in the differential diagnosis. Lumbar Puncture, 11/8/92, revealed: RBC 2, WBC 12 (12 lymphocytes), Glucose 57, Protein 51 (elevated), cytology and cultures were negative. HIV 1 titer was negative. Urine drug screen, negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto-occipital region was consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with Decadron 6mg IV qhours and Cytoxan 0.75gm/m2 (1.25gm). On 12/3/92, she has a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the LUE, loss of consciousness and rightward eye deviation. EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent right-sided sharp discharges. She was placed on Dilantin. She became depressed.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Loss of sensation.  \n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nA 25‑year‑old woman first noticed itching in her right arm above the elbow and in the right shoulder area on October 23, 1992. She also felt tingling in the upper part of both legs and in the toes of her right foot. The itching and tingling went away the next day. On October 25, 1992 she woke up with her legs feeling “asleep” and numb. The numbness slowly moved up to her mid‑chest. She felt unsteady and had trouble walking. She also started having pain in the right shoulder area. She said she had no problems with hot or cold, no fatigue, and no weight loss. She was not taking any medications. Her past medical history was normal. Her family history was notable only for her grandmother’s heart disease. She is married, unemployed, has two children, and was born and raised in Iowa. She denies smoking, drinking, or drug use.\n\n**Physical Examination (October 25, 1992):**  \n- Blood pressure 121/66 mm Hg, heart rate 77 bpm, breathing 14/min, temperature 36.5 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  \n- Speech normal, thoughts clear.  \n- Eye exam: mild pale optic disc on the left eye, no abnormal eye movement.  \n- Muscle strength normal in all limbs except slightly weak hip extensors on the left.  \n- Muscle tone and size normal.  \n- Sensation: reduced pain, pressure, and light touch below the T4‑T5 level on the left side down to the feet. Reduced pain, pressure, light touch, and vibration in both lower limbs (left worse than right). She felt pain from touch in her right arm.  \n- Coordination: fine hand movements, heel‑to‑shin, and rapid alternating movements normal on both sides.  \n- No arm drift. Romberg test not recorded.  \n- Gait: wide‑based and unsteady. She could walk in a straight line and heel‑to‑toe but had poor balance.  \n- Reflexes: normal in upper limbs, slightly brisk in knees, normal in ankles with brief clonus. Plantar reflexes: extensor on the right, flexor on the left.  \n- General exam normal.\n\n**Course (October 1992):**  \nBlood tests (CBC, electrolytes, clotting, ESR, thyroid, ANA, B12, folate, VDRL, urine) were normal.  \nMRI of the spine (October 27) was normal.  \nMRI of the brain (October 28) showed several bright spots on T2 images in white‑matter areas of the right corpus callosum, near the ventricles, in the pons, and in the right pons. These findings were highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis.  \nLumbar puncture (October 28) showed: 1 red cell, 9 white cells (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), glucose 55 mg/dL, protein 46 mg/dL (slightly high), CSF IgG 7.5 mg/dL (high), IgG index 1.3 (high). Oligoclonal bands were present in CSF but not in blood. Other tests (beta‑2 microglobulin, evoked potentials, visual and auditory evoked potentials, HTLV‑1, CSF cultures, cytology) were normal or negative.  \nBecause her symptoms were mainly sensory and not disabling, she was not given medication and was sent home.\n\n**Return Visit (November 7, 1992):**  \nHer right arm tingling, lower‑limb tingling, and weakness had worsened. On November 6 she had slow, slurred speech and trouble expressing herself. She also had difficulty emptying her bladder.  \nExam on November 7: normal vital signs. She was lying still, eyes open, nodding, and blinking rhythmically every few minutes. She knew where she was and the time of day but did not know the season, day of the week, or her own identity. She had a leftward eye preference and weakness on the right side of her face. Her right leg was spastic with ankle clonus. She had abnormal sensation in her right arm. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present.  \nMRI brain (November 7) showed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal lesion was larger than before; the left lesion was less enhanced. Other white‑matter lesions were seen on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations, and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions had increased in size since October. The findings were more consistent with a demyelinating disease than a tumor. Differential diagnoses included post‑viral encephalitis, rapidly progressive demyelinating disease, and tumor.  \nLumbar puncture (November 8) showed: 2 red cells, 12 white cells (all lymphocytes), glucose 57, protein 51 mg/dL (high). Cytology and cultures were negative. HIV test negative. Urine drug screen negative.  \nA stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto‑occipital area confirmed demyelinating disease.  \nShe was treated with IV dexamethasone 6 mg every few hours and cyclophosphamide 0.75 g/m² (1.25 g).  \n\n**December 3, 1992:**  \nShe had a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the left arm, loss of consciousness, and rightward eye deviation. EEG showed diffuse slowing with frequent sharp discharges on the right side. She was started on Dilantin. She became depressed."
