  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder cancer and left hydrocele. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder cancer and left hydrocele. OPERATION: Left hydrocelectomy, cystopyelogram, bladder biopsy, and fulguration for hemostasis. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 66-year-old male with history of smoking and hematuria, had bladder tumor, which was dissected. He has received BCG. The patient is doing well. The patient was supposed to come to the OR for surveillance biopsy and pyelograms. The patient had a large left hydrocele, which was increasingly getting worse and was making it very difficult for the patient to sit to void or put clothes on, etc. Options such as watchful waiting, drainage in the office, and hydrocelectomy were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, infection in the scrotum, enlargement of the scrotum, recurrence, and pain were discussed. The patient understood all the options and wanted to proceed with the procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A transverse scrotal incision was made over the hydrocele sac and the hydrocele fluid was withdrawn. The sac was turned upside down and sutures were placed. Careful attention was made to ensure that the cord was open. The testicle was in normal orientation throughout the entire procedure. The testicle was placed back into the scrotal sac and was pexed with 4-0 Vicryl to the outside dartos to ensure that there was no risk of torsion. Orchiopexy was done at 3 different locations. Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery. The sac was closed using 4-0 Vicryl. The sac was turned upside down so that when it heals, the fluid would not recollect. The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl and Dermabond was applied. Incision measured about 2 cm in size. Subsequently using ACMI cystoscope, a cystoscopy was performed. The urethra appeared normal. There was some scarring at the bulbar urethra, but the scope went in through that area very easily into the bladder. There was a short prostatic fossa. The bladder appeared normal. There was some moderate trabeculation throughout the bladder, some inflammatory changes in the bag part, but nothing of much significance. There were no papillary tumors or stones inside the bladder. Bilateral pyelograms were obtained using 8-French cone-tip catheter, which appeared normal. A cold cup biopsy of the bladder was done and was fulgurated for hemostasis. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was brought to recovery at the end of the procedure after emptying the bladder. The patient was given antibiotics and was told to take it easy. No heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling. Plan was to follow up in about 2 months.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder cancer and a left hydrocele (fluid buildup in the scrotum).  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder cancer and a left hydrocele.  \n\nOPERATION: The surgeon removed the left hydrocele, took pictures of the kidneys and bladder (cystopyelogram), took a small piece of bladder tissue for testing (biopsy), and used a special tool to stop any bleeding (fulguration).  \n\nANESTHESIA: Spinal (the patient was numb from the waist down).  \n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Very little.  \n\nFLUIDS: Normal saline.  \n\nBRIEF HISTORY:  \nThe patient is a 66‑year‑old man who smokes and has had blood in his urine. He was found to have a bladder tumor, which was removed. He has received BCG treatment and is doing well. He was scheduled for another operation to check the bladder and look at the kidneys. He also had a large left hydrocele that was getting worse and made it hard to sit, urinate, or put on clothes.  \n\nThe doctor explained several options:  \n* Watchful waiting (do nothing for now)  \n* Drain the fluid in the office  \n* Surgical removal of the hydrocele (hydrocelectomy)  \n\nThe risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, heart attack, blood clots, lung clots, scrotal infection, swelling, recurrence, and pain were discussed. The patient understood all the choices and decided to have the surgery.  \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and given spinal anesthesia. He was positioned on his back with his legs up (dorsal lithotomy). The surgeon cleaned and covered the area with sterile drapes.  \n\nA small horizontal cut was made in the scrotum over the hydrocele. The fluid was drained. The hydrocele sac was turned inside out and stitched closed. The surgeon made sure the spermatic cord stayed open and the testicle stayed in its normal position. The testicle was sewn back into the scrotum at three spots to prevent twisting (orchiopexy). Blood was stopped with a cautery device. The sac was closed with stitches, turned inside out so fluid would not collect again, and the outer layer (dartos) was stitched. The skin was closed with stitches and a skin glue (Dermabond). The incision was about 2 cm long.  \n\nAfter that, a cystoscope (a thin camera) was inserted through the urethra into the bladder. The urethra looked normal except for some scarring. The bladder looked normal but had some thickening and mild inflammation; no tumors or stones were seen. Images of both kidneys and bladder were taken with a small catheter (pyelograms) and looked normal. A small bladder biopsy was taken and the area was cauterized to stop bleeding.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. He was taken to recovery after emptying his bladder. He was given antibiotics and told to rest, avoid heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling. A follow‑up appointment was scheduled for about two months later."
