  "medical": "COMMENTS: 1. The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness appear normal. The wall motion and left ventricular systolic function appears hyperdynamic with estimated ejection fraction of 70% to 75%. There is near-cavity obliteration seen. There also appears to be increased left ventricular outflow tract gradient at the mid cavity level consistent with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. There is abnormal left ventricular relaxation pattern seen as well as elevated left atrial pressures seen by Doppler examination. 2. The left atrium appears mildly dilated. 3. The right atrium and right ventricle appear normal. 4. The aortic root appears normal. 5. The aortic valve appears calcified with mild aortic valve stenosis, calculated aortic valve area is 1.3 cm square with a maximum instantaneous gradient of 34 and a mean gradient of 19 mm. 6. There is mitral annular calcification extending to leaflets and supportive structures with thickening of mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation. 7. The tricuspid valve appears normal with trace tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 49 mmHg. Estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg. 8. The pulmonary valve appears normal with trace pulmonary insufficiency. 9. There is no pericardial effusion or intracardiac mass seen. 10. There is a color Doppler suggestive of a patent foramen ovale with lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. 11. The study was somewhat technically limited and hence subtle abnormalities could be missed from the study.",
  "layman": "**Comments**\n\n1. The left side of the heart (left ventricle) looks normal in size and wall thickness. It is beating very strongly, pumping out about 70‑75% of the blood it holds. The ventricle is almost completely filled during the beat. The pressure in the middle part of the ventricle is higher than normal, which fits with the strong pumping. The ventricle relaxes a little slower than usual and the pressure in the left atrium (the upper left chamber) is higher than normal, as shown by the Doppler test.\n\n2. The left atrium is slightly enlarged.\n\n3. The right side of the heart (right atrium and right ventricle) looks normal.\n\n4. The aortic root (the part of the aorta that comes from the heart) looks normal.\n\n5. The aortic valve has some calcium buildup and is a little narrowed. The valve area is 1.3 cm². The pressure difference across the valve is 34 mm Hg at its peak and 19 mm Hg on average.\n\n6. The mitral valve has calcium on its ring and leaflets, and the leaflets are thickened. This causes a small amount of blood to leak back (mild mitral regurgitation).\n\n7. The tricuspid valve is normal, with only a tiny leak (trace tricuspid regurgitation). The pressure in the pulmonary artery is moderately high (estimated systolic pressure 49 mm Hg). The right atrial pressure is 10 mm Hg.\n\n8. The pulmonary valve is normal, with only a very small leak (trace pulmonary insufficiency).\n\n9. There is no fluid around the heart (no pericardial effusion) and no mass inside the heart.\n\n10. A color Doppler study suggests a small opening that should have closed after birth (patent foramen ovale) and a fatty thickening of the wall between the atria (lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum).\n\n11. The study had some technical limits, so very small problems might have been missed."
