Tethered brachial artery, left elbow. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Closed reduction percutaneous pinning, left distal humerus. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite, room #2 at ABCD General Hospital. A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing. He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm. He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow. His parents' were both present preoperatively. His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region. Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible. He did have a radial pulse palpable. PROCEDURE: After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed. The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner. Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly. Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out. The elbow was hyperflexed. Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve. The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm. After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally. Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital. He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally. This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler. A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler. Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______. A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery. Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this. I then came back in and then we proceeded. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery. There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally. Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses. We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed. The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position. He was splinted posteriorly. Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites. K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above. There is concern for growth plate disturbance. He will be watched very closely for the potential development of re-perfusing compartment syndrome. A full and complete neurologic exam will be impossible tonight, but will be carried on a sequential basis starting tomorrow morning. There is always a potential for loss of elbow motion, overall cosmetic elbow alignment, and elbow function.",

The same closed type‑III supracondylar fracture of the left elbow.  \n2. The brachial artery in the left elbow was tethered (restricted).\n\n**Procedure performed:**  \nClosed reduction and percutaneous pinning of the left elbow.\n\n**Specifications:**  \nThe surgery was done in the inpatient operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital. Dr. X from vascular surgery also helped and recorded his part separately.\n\n**History and findings:**  \nThe patient is a 4‑year‑old white boy who is mostly right‑handed. He fell from a swing and broke his left elbow. He had never had problems with that arm before. In the emergency department his elbow looked badly deformed. X‑ray and physical exam confirmed a closed type‑III supracondylar fracture. The skin over the front of the elbow was puckered and bruised. A quick neurological exam showed that the nerves (ulnar, median, radial) seemed okay, though a full exam wasn’t possible. A radial pulse was felt.\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter explaining all the options, risks, and possible future problems (such as bone misalignment, infection, loss of motion, nerve or artery issues, and the need for more surgery) to the parents, they agreed to proceed.  \nThe child was placed on the operating table and given general anesthesia.  \nThe bone was gently moved back into place by squeezing the soft tissues and pulling slowly while the elbow was bent.  \nTwo thin wires (0.045 mm) were inserted: one on the outer side and one on the inner side of the elbow, taking care to avoid the ulnar nerve. X‑ray confirmed the bone was properly aligned. A pulse was checked again.\n\nBecause the radial pulse was weak and Doppler testing showed a weak ulnar pulse, Dr. X (vascular surgery) was consulted. He examined the brachial artery and found it was stuck (tethered) near the fracture, reducing blood flow. After discussing this with the parents, we decided to open the artery, release the tether, and restore blood flow. The artery was freed, and pulses became strong again.\n\nThe wound was closed with stitches: a #4‑0 Vicryl for the deep tissue and a running #5‑0 Vicryl for the skin. Steri‑Strips were applied. The arm was positioned slightly bent and placed in a posterior splint. Padding was added around the pin sites. The pins were bent, cut, and capped.\n\n**Post‑operative outlook:**  \nThe recovery is uncertain because of the fracture and the artery issue. There is a risk that the growth plate could be affected. We will watch closely for any signs of compartment syndrome (pressure building inside the arm). A full neurological exam will be done gradually starting tomorrow. There is a chance of reduced elbow movement, cosmetic changes, or loss of function."
