  "medical": "TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained through the facial bones without contrast. Additional high resolution coronal reconstructed images were also obtained for better visualization of the osseous structures. FINDINGS: The osseous structures within the face are intact with no evidence of fracture or dislocation. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits. The soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute abnormalities.",
  "layman": "TECHNIQUE: We took a series of CT scans of the face without using contrast dye. We also made detailed coronal images to see the bones more clearly.  \n\nFINDINGS: All the facial bones look normal—there are no breaks or dislocations. The sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The eye sockets and the muscles around the eyes are normal. The surrounding soft tissues look fine.  \n\nIMPRESSION: No urgent problems were found."
