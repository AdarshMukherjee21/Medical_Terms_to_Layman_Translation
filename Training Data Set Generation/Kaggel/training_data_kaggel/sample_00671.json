PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius. IMPLANTS: Wright Medical Micronail size 2. ANESTHESIA: LMA. TOURNIQUET TIME: 49 minutes. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. PATHOLOGY: None. TIME OUT: Time out was performed before the procedure started. INDICATIONS: The patient was a 42-year-old female who fell and sustained a displaced left metaphyseal distal radius fracture indicated for osteosynthesis. The patient was in early stage of gestation. Benefits and risks including radiation exposure were discussed with the patient and consulted her primary care doctor. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Supine position, LMA anesthesia, well-padded arm, tourniquet, Hibiclens, alcohol prep, and sterile drape. Exsanguination achieved, tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. First, under fluoroscopy the fracture was reduced. A 0.045 K-wire was inserted from dorsal ulnar corner of the distal radius and crossing fracture line to maintain the reduction. A 2-cm radial incision, superficial radial nerve was exposed and protected. Dissecting between the first and second dorsal extensor retinaculum, the second dorsal extensor compartment was elevated off from the distal radius. The guidewire was inserted under fluoroscopy. A cannulated drill was used to drill antral hole. Antral awl was inserted. Then we reamed the canal to size 2. Size 2 Micronail was inserted to the medullary canal. Using distal locking guide, three locking screws were inserted distally. The second dorsal incision was made. The deep radial dorsal surface was exposed. Using locking guide, two proximal shaft screws were inserted and locked the nail to the radius. Fluoroscopic imaging was taken and showing restoration of the height, tilt, and inclination of the radius. At this point, tourniquet was deflated, hemostasis achieved, wounds irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied. The patient then was extubated and transferred to the recovery room under stable condition. Postoperatively, the patient will see a therapist within five days. We will immobilize wrist for two weeks and then starting flexion-extension and prosupination exercises.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The patient had a broken left wrist bone (distal radius) that was displaced but not involving the joint.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as before.  \n\nPROCEDURE: Surgery to straighten and hold the broken wrist bone in place.  \nIMPLANTS: Wright Medical Micronail size 2.  \nANESTHESIA: Laryngeal mask airway (LMA).  \nTOURNIQUET TIME: 49 minutes.  \nBLOOD LOSS: Minimal.  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \nPATHOLOGY: None.  \nTIME OUT: A safety check was done before starting the surgery.  \n\nINDICATIONS: A 42‑year‑old woman fell and broke the lower part of her left wrist bone. The break was displaced, so surgery was needed to fix it. She was early in pregnancy. The doctor explained the benefits and risks, including radiation from imaging, and talked with her primary doctor.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient lay on her back. The LMA was used for anesthesia. The arm was padded, a tourniquet was applied, and the area was cleaned with Hibiclens and alcohol and covered with a sterile drape. Blood was let out of the arm and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  \n\nUnder X‑ray guidance, the broken bone was put back into place. A thin wire (0.045 mm) was inserted from the back‑up corner of the wrist bone, crossing the break to keep it aligned. A 2‑cm cut was made on the side of the wrist; the superficial radial nerve was seen and protected. The surgeon lifted the second dorsal extensor compartment off the bone. The guidewire was placed again under X‑ray. A special drill made a hole in the bone, and an awl was used to widen it. The canal was then reamed to fit a size 2 Micronail. The nail was inserted into the bone’s inner canal. Using a locking guide, three screws were put at the end of the nail.  \n\nA second cut was made on the deep side of the wrist. The deep radial surface was exposed. Two more screws were placed up the shaft of the nail and locked it to the bone. X‑ray images showed the bone’s height, tilt, and angle were restored.  \n\nThe tourniquet was released, bleeding was stopped, the wounds were washed and closed in layers, and a sterile dressing was applied. The patient was taken off the breathing tube and sent to recovery while stable.  \n\nAfter surgery, the patient will see a physical therapist within five days. The wrist will be kept still for two weeks, then gentle flexion‑extension and forearm rotation exercises will begin."
