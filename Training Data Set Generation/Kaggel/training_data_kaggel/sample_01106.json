COMPLICATIONS: None. PLAN: non-weightbearing right lower extremity, clindamycin x 48 hours. OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient is a 53-year-old female who is a pedestrian struck, in a motor vehicle accident and sustained numerous injuries. She sustained a right open ankle fracture, right femur fracture, right femoral neck fracture, right open knee, and right elbow abrasions. Given the emergent nature of the right femoral neck fracture and her young age as well as the open fracture, it was decided to proceed with an urgent operative intervention. The risks of surgery were discussed in detail and the consents were signed. The operative site was marked. The patient was taken to the operating room where she was given preoperative clindamycin. The patient had then general anesthetic performed by anesthesia. A well-padded side tourniquet was placed. Attention was turned to the right ankle first. The large medical laceration was extended and the tissues were debrided. All dirty of the all injured bone, muscle, and tissues were debrided. Wound was then copiously irrigated with 8 liters of normal saline. At this point, the medial malleolus fracture was identified and was reduced. This was then fixed in with two 4.5 mm cannulated Synthes screws. Next, the attention was turned to lateral malleolus. Incision was made over the distal fibula. It was carried down sharply through the skin in the subcutaneous issues. Care was taken to preserve the superficial peroneal nerve. The fracture was identified, and there was noted to be very comminuted distal fibula fracture. The fracture was reduced and confirmed with fluoroscopy. A 7 hole Synthes 3.5 mm locking plate was placed. This was placed in a bridging fashion with three screws above and three screws below the fracture. Appropriate reduction was confirmed under fluoroscopy. A cotton test was performed, and the ankle did not open up. Therefore, it was decided not to proceed with syndesmotic screw. Next, the patient was then placed in the fracture table and all extremities were well padded. All prominences were padded. The right leg was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A 2-cm incision was made just distal to the greater trochanter. This was carried down sharply through the skin to the fascia. The femur was identified. The guidewire for a striker Asnis 6.5 mm screw was placed in the appropriate position. The triangle guide was then used to ensure appropriate triangular formation of the remainder of the screws. A reduction of the fracture was performed prior to placing all the guide wires. A single 8 mm Asnis screw was placed inferiorly followed by two 6.5 mm screws superiorly. Next, the abrasions on the right elbow were copiously irrigated. The necrotic and dead tissue was removed. The abrasions did not appear to enter the joints. They were wrapped with Xeroform 4 x 4 x 4 Kerlix and Ace wrap. Next, the lacerations of the anterior knee were connected and were extended in the midline. They were carried down sharply to the skin and the retinacular issues to the joint. The intercondylar notch was identified. A guide wire for the striker T2 retrograde nail was placed and localized with fluoroscopy. The opening reamer was used following the bolted guide wire was then passed. The femur was then sequentially reamed using the flexible reamers. A T2 retrograde nail 10 x 340 was then passed. Two 5 mm distal locking screws and two 5 mm proximal locking screws were then placed. Prior to reaming and passing the retrograde nail, the knee was copiously irrigated with 8 liters of normal saline. Any dead tissues in the knee were identified and were debrided using rongeurs and curettes. The patient was placed in the AO splints for the right ankle. The wounds were dressed with Xeroform 4 x 4 x 4s and IO band. The care was then transferred for the patient to Halstead Service. The plan will be non-weightbearing right lower extremity and antibiotics for 48 hours. Dr. X was present and scrubbed for the entirety of the procedure.",
  "layman": "**Title of Operation**  \n1. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right ankle: the wound was cleaned and dead tissue removed, and the outer ankle bone was fixed with a 3.5‑mm locking plate and the inner ankle bone was fixed with two 4.5‑mm screws.  \n2. Closed reduction and screw fixation of the right femoral neck fracture: one 8‑mm screw and two 6.5‑mm screws were used.  \n3. Retrograde femoral nail: a 10‑mm × 340‑mm nail with a 10‑mm INCAP was inserted, plus two 5‑mm screws at the front and two 5‑mm screws at the back.  \n4. Cleaning and removal of dead tissue from the right knee.  \n5. Cleaning and removal of dead tissue from the right elbow abrasions.  \n\n**Pre‑operative Diagnosis**  \n1. Right open ankle fracture  \n2. Right femur shaft fracture  \n3. Right femoral neck fracture  \n4. Right open knee injury  \n5. Right elbow abrasions  \n\n**Post‑operative Diagnosis**  \nSame as pre‑operative.  \n\n**Intravenous Fluids**  \n650 packed red blood cells.  \n\n**Tourniquet Time**  \n2 hours.  \n\n**Urine Output**  \n1600 cc.  \n\n**Estimated Blood Loss**  \n250 cc.  \n\n**Complications**  \nNone.  \n\n**Plan**  \nRight lower leg will not bear weight; clindamycin for 48 hours.  \n\n**Operative Narrative**  \nA 53‑year‑old woman was hit by a car while walking. She had an open fracture of the right ankle, a fracture of the right femur, a fracture of the right femoral neck, an open injury to the right knee, and abrasions on the right elbow. Because the femoral neck fracture was urgent and the ankle fracture was open, surgery was performed immediately. The risks were explained and she signed consent. The surgical sites were marked. She received clindamycin before surgery and was put under general anesthesia. A padded tourniquet was applied to the right leg.  \n\nThe ankle was treated first. The large cut was extended and all dirty tissue, bone, muscle, and skin were removed. The wound was washed with 8 liters of normal saline. The inner ankle bone fracture was lined up and fixed with two 4.5‑mm screws. The outer ankle bone fracture was next. An incision was made over the lower fibula, careful to protect the superficial peroneal nerve. The fracture was lined up and confirmed with X‑ray. A 7‑hole 3.5‑mm locking plate was placed on the fibula, with three screws above and three below the break. The ankle stayed closed, so no syndesmotic screw was used.  \n\nThe patient was then put on a fracture table. The right leg was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A 2‑cm cut was made just below the greater trochanter of the femur. A guidewire for a 6.5‑mm screw was placed, and a triangle guide was used to position the other screws. The femoral neck fracture was lined up before the guidewires were inserted. One 8‑mm screw was placed at the bottom, followed by two 6.5‑mm screws at the top.  \n\nThe right elbow abrasions were washed with 8 liters of saline. Dead tissue was removed. The cuts did not reach the joint. They were covered with Xeroform and wrapped with Kerlix and Ace wrap.  \n\nThe open injury to the right knee was next. The cut was extended to the joint, and the joint was cleaned. A guidewire for a retrograde nail was placed and checked with X‑ray. The opening reamer was used, and the femur was reamed with flexible reamers. A 10‑mm × 340‑mm T2 retrograde nail was inserted. Two 5‑mm screws were put at the front and two 5‑mm screws at the back. The knee was washed again with 8 liters of saline, and any dead tissue was removed with rongeurs and curettes.  \n\nThe right ankle was splinted with AO splints. All wounds were dressed with Xeroform and an IO band. The patient was transferred to the Halstead Service for recovery. The plan is no weight on the right leg and clindamycin for 48 hours. Dr. X was present and scrubbed for the entire procedure."
