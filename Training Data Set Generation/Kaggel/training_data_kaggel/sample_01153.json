POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left obstructed renal ureteropelvic junction obstruction status post pyeloplasty, percutaneous procedure, and pyeloureteroscopy x2, and status post Pseudomonas pyelonephritis x6, renal insufficiency, and solitary kidney. PROCEDURE: Cystoscopy under anesthesia, retrograde and antegrade pyeloureteroscopy, left ureteropelvic junction obstruction, difficult and open renal biopsy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthetic with a caudal block x2. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 1000 mL crystalloid. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. SPECIMENS: Tissue sent to pathology is a renal biopsy. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: A stenotic scarred ureteropelvic junction with dilated ureter and dilated renal pelvis. TUBES AND DRAINS: A 10-French silicone Foley catheter with 3 mL in balloon and a 4.7-French ureteral double J-stent multilength. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 3-1/2-year-old boy, who has a solitary left kidney with renal insufficiency with creatinine of 1.2, who has had a ureteropelvic junction repair performed by Dr. Chang. It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction. Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operative room. Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance. Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position. Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French. The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis. I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right. We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go. An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter. A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two. Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all. Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder. Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised. Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________. At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia. Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum. Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this. The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted. The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction. Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter. Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture. Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder. Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed. Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair. Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect. The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage. Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position. This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide. Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health. Electrocautery was used on the base. There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft. Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures. Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers. Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively. A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder. The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg. A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses:**  \nThe boy’s left kidney has a blockage at the junction where the ureter meets the kidney (ureteropelvic junction obstruction). He had surgery to fix this (pyeloplasty) and other procedures, but the blockage returned. He has had six episodes of kidney infection caused by Pseudomonas, reduced kidney function, and only one kidney.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses:**  \nThe same conditions as before: left kidney blockage, previous surgery, repeated infections, low kidney function, and one kidney.\n\n**Procedure:**  \nThe doctors performed a cystoscopy (looking inside the bladder), a retrograde and an antegrade ureteropelvic junction inspection, and a difficult open kidney biopsy.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia with a breathing tube and two caudal (lower back) nerve blocks.\n\n**Fluids given:**  \n1,000 mL of crystalloid solution.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:**  \nLess than 10 mL.\n\n**Specimens:**  \nA piece of kidney tissue was sent to the lab for analysis.\n\n**Abnormal findings:**  \nThe junction where the ureter meets the kidney was scarred and narrowed, causing the ureter and the kidney’s collecting area to become enlarged.\n\n**Tubes and drains:**  \nA 10‑French silicone Foley catheter (with a 3 mL balloon) was placed in the bladder, and a 4.7‑French double‑J stent was inserted into the ureter.\n\n**Indications for the operation:**  \nThe patient is a 3½‑year‑old boy with only one left kidney that is not working well (creatinine 1.2). He previously had a pyeloplasty that failed, leading to repeated kidney infections, two percutaneous tube placements, and ureteroscopy with balloon dilation. Because the blockage kept coming back and he has only one kidney, the surgeons decided to perform another operation to correct the obstruction.\n\n**Description of the operation:**  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room, checked for correct identity, and given general anesthesia. The surgeons (Dr. X and Dr. Y) planned the steps together. After the caudal block, the boy was positioned on his back. A small tube (bougie) was used to guide a 9.5‑French cystoscope into the bladder. The bladder was clear of infection. The surgeons found the openings of both ureters; the right one did not produce urine. A small catheter was inserted into the left ureter. An imaging study (nephrostogram) showed that contrast filled the enlarged kidney pelvis but did not pass into the ureter. A retrograde study revealed a narrow band across the junction. The surgeons removed the old catheter, inserted a guidewire, and placed a new 4.7‑French double‑J stent that curled into the bladder.\n\nAfter removing the cystoscope, a 10‑French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder. The boy was then turned to a side‑lying position with the left side up, padded and protected. The surgical field was cleaned and draped. The surgeons reopened the old incision, extended it, and used cautery to cut through the skin and underlying tissues. They carefully dissected through the back muscles and into the space behind the abdominal wall to reach the kidney. The kidney’s blood vessels and the spermatic vessels were identified and protected. The ureter was found to be stuck to the surrounding tissue, so the surgeons freed it with careful cutting and clamping.\n\nThey isolated the kidney pelvis and made a new opening for the ureter. The ureter was cut at its base, tied off, and trimmed. The new ureter was spatulated (flared) for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was placed into the correct position. The kidney pelvis was opened and repaired with interrupted stitches (5‑0 Monocryl) on the top and sides, and the surgeons tied the stitches together to close the junction without leaking. The ureter was positioned normally in the back of the body, about 1.5 cm wide.\n\nThe surgeons then took a small wedge of kidney tissue for biopsy. They used a small knife and scissors, controlled bleeding with cautery, and closed the biopsy site with tissue glue and a small patch (Gelfoam). The wound was closed in layers: the deep muscle layer with a running stitch (3‑0 Vicryl), the outer fascia with 4‑0 Vicryl, and the skin with 4‑0 Rapide. A nylon stitch was placed around the old nephrostomy tube, which was left clamped. Tissue adhesive was applied over the incision, a sterile dressing was placed, and the Foley catheter was secured to the leg.\n\nA second caudal block was given for pain control. The boy was stable when transferred to the recovery room."
