  "medical": "CC: Seizures. HX: The patient was initially evaluated at UIHC at 7 years of age. He had been well until 7 months prior to evaluation when he started having spells which were described as &quot;dizzy spells&quot; lasting from several seconds to one minute in duration. They occurred quite infrequently and he was able to resume activity immediately following the episodes. The spell became more frequent and prolonged, and by the time of initial evaluation were occurring 2-3 times per day and lasting 2-3 minutes in duration. In addition, in the 3 months prior to evaluation, the right upper extremity would become tonic and flexed during the episodes, and he began to experience post ictal fatigue. BIRTH HX: 32 weeks gestation to a G4 mother and weighed 4#11oz. He was placed in an incubator for 3 weeks. He was jaundiced, but there was no report that he required treatment. PMH: Single febrile convulsion lasting &quot;3 hours&quot; at age 2 years. MEDS: none. EXAM: Appears healthy and in no acute distress. Unremarkable general and neurologic exam. Impression: Psychomotor seizures. Studies: Skull X-Rays were unremarkable. EEG showed &quot;minimal spike activity during hyperventilation, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area, in drowsiness and sleep. This record also showed moderate amplitude asymmetry ( left greater than right) over the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding.&quot; COURSE: The patient was initially treated with Phenobarbital; then Dilantin was added (early 1970's); then Depakene was added ( early 1980's) due to poor seizure control. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed &quot;Left mid-temporal spike focus with surrounding slow abnormality, especially posterior to the anterior temporal areas (sparing the parasagittal region). In addition, the right lateral anterior hemisphere voltage is relatively depressed. ...this suggests two separate areas of cerebral pathology.&quot; He underwent his first HCT scan in Sioux City in 1981, and this revealed an right temporal arachnoid cyst. The patient had behavioral problems throughout elementary/junior high/high school. He underwent several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and was told that surgery was unwarranted. He was placed on numerous antiepileptic medication combinations including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite this he averaged 2-3 spells a month. He was last seen, 6/19/95, and was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. His typical spells were described as sudden in onset and without aura. He frequently becomes tonic or undergoes tonic-clonic movement and falls with associated loss of consciousness. He usually has rapid recovery and can return to work in 20 minutes. He works at a Turkey packing plant. Serial HCT scans showed growth in the arachnoid cyst until 1991, when growth arrest appeared to have occurred.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Seizures.  \n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nThe patient was first seen at UIHC when he was 7 years old. He was healthy until about 7 months before that visit, when he began having “dizzy spells.” These spells lasted from a few seconds up to one minute and were rare. After each spell he could start doing things right away. Over time the spells became more frequent and longer. By the time he was evaluated, they happened 2–3 times a day and lasted 2–3 minutes. In the three months before the visit, the right arm would stiffen and bend during the spells, and he would feel very tired afterward.  \n\n**Birth History:** Born at 32 weeks to a fourth pregnancy, weighing 4 lb 11 oz. He spent three weeks in an incubator. He had jaundice, but no treatment was reported.  \n\n**Past Medical History:** One febrile seizure at age 2 that lasted about 3 hours. No other medications.  \n\n**Exam:** Looks healthy and not in distress. General and neurological exams are normal.  \n\n**Impression:** Psychomotor seizures.  \n\n**Studies:** Skull X‑rays were normal. An EEG showed only a little spike activity when he breathed fast, and some random sharp waves over the left temporal area during sleep. The EEG also showed that the left side of the brain had higher activity than the right in the frontal, central, and temporal areas – a strange finding.  \n\n**Course:**  \n- Started on Phenobarbital, then added Dilantin in the early 1970s, and later Depakene in the early 1980s because seizures were not well controlled.  \n- An EEG on 8/22/66 showed a spike focus in the left mid‑temporal region with surrounding slow waves, especially behind the front temporal area. The right front‑lateral area had lower voltage. This suggested two separate abnormal areas in the brain.  \n- First CT scan in 1981 found a right temporal arachnoid cyst.  \n- He had behavioral problems through school. He had several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic, and they said surgery was not needed.  \n- He was put on many anti‑seizure drug combinations: Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Even then he had about 2–3 spells a month.  \n- The last visit was 6/19/95; he was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. Spells started suddenly with no warning, often causing stiffening or tonic‑clonic movements and a fall with loss of consciousness. He usually recovers quickly and can return to work in about 20 minutes. He works at a turkey‑packing plant.  \n- Serial CT scans showed the arachnoid cyst grew until 1991, when it stopped growing."
