  "medical": "CC: Sudden onset blindness. HX: This 58 y/o RHF was in her usual healthy state, until 4:00PM, 1/8/93, when she suddenly became blind. Tongue numbness and slurred speech occurred simultaneously with the loss of vision. The vision transiently improved to &quot;severe blurring&quot; enroute to a local ER, but worsened again once there. While being evaluated she became unresponsive, even to deep noxious stimuli. She was transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. Upon arrival at UIHC her signs and symptoms were present but markedly improved. PMH: 1) Hysterectomy many years previous. 2) Herniorrhaphy in past. 3) DJD, relieved with NSAIDs. FHX/SHX: Married x 27yrs. Husband denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use for her. Unremarkable FHx. MEDS: none. EXAM: Vitals: 36.9C. HR 93. BP 151/93. RR 22. 98% O2Sat. MS: somnolent, but arousable to verbal stimulation. minimal speech. followed simple commands on occasion. CN: Blinked to threat from all directions. EOM appeared full, Pupils 2/2 decreasing to 1/1. +/+Corneas. Winced to PP in all areas of Face. +/+Gag. Tongue midline. Oculocephalic reflex intact. Motor: UE 4/5 proximally. Full strength in all other areas. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: Withdrew to PP in all extremities. Gait: ND. Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout UE, 3/3 patella, 2/2 ankles, Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: MRI Brain revealed bilateral thalamic strokes. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an intraatrial septal aneurysm with right to left shunt. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed the same. No intracardiac thrombus was found. Lower extremity dopplers were unremarkable. Carotid duplex revealed 0-15% bilateral ICA stenosis. Neuroophthalmologic evaluation revealed evidence of a supranuclear vertical gaze palsy OU (diminished up and down gaze). Neuropsychologic assessment 1/12-15/93 revealed severe impairment of anterograde verbal and visual memory, including acquisition and delayed recall and recognition. Speech was effortful and hypophonic with very defective verbal associative fluency. Reading comprehension was somewhat preserved, though she complained that despite the ability to see type clearly, she could not make sense of words. There was impairment of 2-D constructional praxis. A follow-up Neuropsychology evaluation in 7/93 revealed little improvement. Laboratory studies, TSH, FT4, CRP, ESR, GS, PT/PTT were unremarkable. Total serum cholesterol 195, Triglycerides 57, HDL 43, LDL 141. She was placed on ASA and discharged1/19/93. She was last seen on 5/2/95 and was speaking fluently and lucidly. She continued to have mild decreased vertical eye movements. Coordination and strength testing were fairly unremarkable. She continues to take ASA 325 mg qd.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: sudden blindness.  \nHistory: A 58‑year‑old woman was healthy until 4:00 p.m. on January 8, 1993, when she suddenly lost vision. She also felt numbness in her tongue and her speech was slurred at the same time. Her vision briefly improved to severe blurring while she was on the way to a local emergency room, but got worse again once she arrived. While being examined she became unresponsive, even to painful stimuli. She was moved to the University of Illinois Hospital for further care. When she arrived, her symptoms were still there but had improved a lot.\n\nPast medical history: a hysterectomy many years ago, a hernia repair, and joint pain that improves with non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs.  \nFamily and social history: married for 27 years; her husband says she does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. No other significant family history.  \nMedications: none.\n\nPhysical exam: Temperature 36.9 °C, heart rate 93, blood pressure 151/93, breathing 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98%. She was sleepy but could be awakened by talking. She spoke very little and could follow simple instructions sometimes. Her cranial nerves: she blinked when something threatened her from any direction; eye movements were normal; pupils were equal and reacted to light; her corneas were clear; she winced when pressure was applied to any part of her face; she could gag; her tongue was straight in the middle; the eye‑head reflex was normal. Muscle strength: her upper arms were 4/5 near the shoulder, all other muscles were normal. Muscle tone and size were normal. Sensation: she withdrew when pressure was applied to all limbs. She could not walk. Reflexes: normal in the arms, knees, and ankles; the reflex that pulls the toes down was normal. General exam: nothing abnormal.\n\nCourse: A brain scan (MRI) showed strokes in both thalamus areas. A heart ultrasound from the chest (TTE) found a bulge in the wall between the heart’s upper chambers that allowed blood to flow from the right side to the left side. A second heart ultrasound through the esophagus (TEE) confirmed this finding. No blood clots were seen inside the heart. Leg blood flow tests were normal. A carotid artery scan showed only mild narrowing (0‑15%) in both internal carotid arteries. Eye‑specialist testing found a problem moving the eyes up and down in both eyes. A neuropsychology test done on January 12‑15, 1993 showed severe trouble remembering new spoken and written information, including learning new facts and recalling them later. Her speech was slow and soft, and she had difficulty finding words. She could read but had trouble understanding what she read. She also had difficulty drawing or building two‑dimensional shapes. A follow‑up neuropsychology test in July 1993 showed little improvement. Blood tests for thyroid function, inflammation, clotting, and other routine labs were normal. Her cholesterol was 195 mg/dL, triglycerides 57 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, LDL 141 mg/dL. She was started on aspirin (ASA) and discharged on January 19, 1993. She was last seen on May 2, 1995, speaking fluently and clear. She still had mild difficulty moving her eyes up and down. Her coordination and strength were mostly normal. She continues to take 325 mg of aspirin daily."
