  "medical": "A 62-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and implanted defibrillator. COMPARISON STUDIES: None. MEDICATION: Lopressor 5 mg IV. HEART RATE AFTER MEDICATION: 64bpm EXAM:TECHNIQUE: Tomographic images were obtained of the heart and chest with a 64 detector row scanner using slice thicknesses of less than 1 mm. 80ccs of Isovue 370 was injected in the right arm. TECHNICAL QUALITY: Examination is limited secondary to extensive artifact from defibrillator wires. There is good demonstration of the coronary arteries and there is good bolus timing. FINDINGS: LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY: The left main coronary artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a normal ostium. There is no calcific or non-calcific plaque. The vessel bifurcates into a left anterior descending artery and a left circumflex artery. LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY: The left anterior descending artery is a moderate-sized vessel, with a small first diagonal branch and a large second diagonal branch. The vessel continues as a small vessel, tapering at the apex of the left ventricle. There is calcific plaque within the mid vessel, with dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the second diagonal branch. This limits evaluation of the vessel lumen, and although a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded, there is no evidence of a high-grade stenosis. There is ostial calcification within the second diagonal branch as well. The LAD distal to the second diagonal branch is small relative to the more proximal vessel, and this is worrisome for a proximal flow-limiting lesion. In addition, there is marked tapering of the D2 branch distal to the proximal and ostial calcific plaque. This is worrisome for either occlusion or a high-grade stenosis. There is only minimal contrast that is identified in the distal vessel. LEFT CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY: The left circumflex artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium. There is calcific plaque within the proximal vessel. There is dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the OM1, and the AV groove branch. The AV groove branch tapers as a small vessel at the base of the heart. The dense calcific plaque within the bifurcation of the OM1 and the AV groove branch limits evaluation of the vessel lumen. There is no demonstrated high-grade stenosis, but a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here. RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: The right coronary artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium. There is proximal mixed calcific and non-calcific plaque, but there is no flow-limiting lesion. The vessel continues as a moderate-sized vessel to the crux of the heart, supplying a small posterior descending artery and moderate to large posterolateral ventricular branches. There is scattered calcific plaque within the mid vessel and there is also calcific plaque within the distal vessel at the origin of the posterior descending artery. There is no flow-limited lesion demonstrated. The right coronary artery is dominant. NONCORONARY CARDIAC STRUCTURE: CARDIAC CHAMBERS: There is diffuse myocardial thinning within the left ventricle, particularly within the apex where there is subendocardial calcification, consistent with chronic infarction. There is ventricular enlargement. There is no demonstrated aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. CARDIAC VALVES: There is calcification within the left aortic valve cusp. The aortic valve is tri-leaflet. Normal mitral valve. PERICARDIUM: Normal. GREAT VESSELS: There are atherosclerotic changes within the aorta. VISUALIZED LUNG PARENCHYMA, MEDIASTINUM AND CHEST WALL: Normal. IMPRESSION: Limited examination secondary to extensive artifact from the pacemaker wires. There is extensive calcific plaque within the left anterior descending artery as well as within the proximal second diagonal branch. There is marked tapering of the LAD distal to the bifurcation of the D1 and this is worrisome for a flow-limiting lesion, but there is no evidence of occlusion. There is marked tapering of the D1 branch distal to the calcific plaque and occlusion cannot be excluded. There is dense calcific plaque within the left circumflex artery, and although a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here, there is no evidence of an occlusion or high-grade stenosis. There is mixed soft and calcific plaque within the proximal RCA, but there is no flow limiting lesion demonstrated. There is diffuse thinning of the left ventricular wall, most focal at the apex where there is also dense calcification, consistent with chronic infarction. There is no demonstrated aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.",
  "layman": "A 62‑year‑old man with a history of heart muscle damage from a heart attack and a defibrillator implanted.  \n**Comparison studies:** None.  \n**Medication:** 5 mg of Lopressor (propranolol) given IV.  \n**Heart rate after medication:** 64 beats per minute.\n\n**Exam technique:**  \nA CT scan of the heart and chest was done with a 64‑row scanner. Thin slices (<1 mm) were used. 80 cc of contrast (Isovue 370) was injected into his right arm.  \n**Technical quality:** The scan is limited because the defibrillator wires create a lot of artifact. The coronary arteries are still visible and the timing of the contrast was good.\n\n**Findings**\n\n*Left main coronary artery:*  \n- Normal opening, moderate size.  \n- No plaque.  \n- Splits into the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries.\n\n*Left anterior descending artery (LAD):*  \n- Moderate size.  \n- Small first diagonal branch, large second diagonal branch.  \n- Becomes a small vessel at the heart’s apex.  \n- Calcium plaque in the middle of the vessel and dense calcium at the split of the second diagonal branch, making it hard to see the inside of the vessel.  \n- No clear severe narrowing, but a blockage that limits flow can’t be ruled out.  \n- Calcium at the opening of the second diagonal branch.  \n- The LAD after the second diagonal branch is smaller than before, raising concern for a blockage higher up.  \n- The second diagonal branch narrows sharply after the calcium plaque, which could mean a blockage or severe narrowing. Only a little contrast reaches the far end.\n\n*Left circumflex artery (LCx):*  \n- Moderate size, normal opening.  \n- Calcium plaque in the front part of the vessel.  \n- Dense calcium at the split of the OM1 branch and the AV groove branch.  \n- The AV groove branch narrows into a small vessel at the heart’s base.  \n- The calcium at these splits makes it hard to see the inside.  \n- No clear severe narrowing, but a blockage that limits flow can’t be ruled out.\n\n*Right coronary artery (RCA):*  \n- Moderate size, normal opening.  \n- Mixed calcium and soft plaque near the start, but no blockage that limits flow.  \n- Continues as a moderate vessel to the heart’s back corner, giving a small posterior descending artery and moderate‑to‑large side branches.  \n- Some calcium in the middle and at the start of the posterior descending artery.  \n- No flow‑limiting blockage.  \n- The RCA is the dominant artery.\n\n*Non‑coronary cardiac structures*  \n\n- **Heart chambers:** The left ventricle wall is thin throughout, especially at the apex where there is calcium under the inner layer, indicating an old heart attack. The ventricle is enlarged. No aneurysm or pseudo‑aneurysm.  \n- **Valves:** Calcium on one cusp of the aortic valve; the valve has three leaflets. Mitral valve looks normal.  \n- **Pericardium:** Normal.  \n- **Large vessels:** Atherosclerosis in the aorta.  \n- **Lungs, mediastinum, chest wall:** Normal.\n\n**Impression**  \nThe scan is limited by the defibrillator wires.  \n- There is a lot of calcium plaque in the LAD and the front part of the second diagonal branch. The LAD narrows sharply after the split of the first diagonal branch, which could mean a blockage that limits blood flow, but no complete blockage is seen.  \n- The second diagonal branch narrows sharply after the calcium plaque; a blockage cannot be ruled out.  \n- The LCx has dense calcium plaque; a blockage that limits flow cannot be ruled out, but no severe narrowing is seen.  \n- The RCA has mixed plaque but no flow‑limiting blockage.  \n- The left ventricle wall is thin, especially at the apex where there is also dense calcium, consistent with an old heart attack.  \n- No aneurysm or pseudo‑aneurysm is seen."
