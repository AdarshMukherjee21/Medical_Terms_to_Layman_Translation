  "medical": "DESCRIPTION: The patient was placed in the supine position and was prepped and draped in the usual manner. The left vas was grasped in between the fingers. The skin and vas were anesthetized with local anesthesia. The vas was grasped with an Allis clamp. Skin was incised and the vas deferens was regrasped with another Allis clamp. The sheath was incised with a scalpel and elevated using the iris scissors and clamps were used to ligate the vas deferens. The portion in between the clamps was excised and the ends of the vas were clamped using hemoclips, two in the testicular side and one on the proximal side. The incision was then inspected for hemostasis and closed with 3-0 chromic catgut interrupted fashion. A similar procedure was carried out on the right side. Dry sterile dressings were applied and the patient put on a scrotal supporter. The procedure was then terminated.",
  "layman": "The patient was laid on their back and prepared in the usual way. The left vas deferens was held between the fingers. Local anesthesia was given to numb the skin and the vas. An Allis clamp was used to hold the vas, then a small cut was made in the skin and the vas was re‑grasped with another Allis clamp. The covering sheath was cut with a scalpel, lifted with iris scissors, and the vas was tied off with clamps. The piece of vas between the clamps was removed, and the remaining ends were sealed with hemoclips – two on the testicle side and one on the upper side. The cut was checked for bleeding and closed with 3‑0 chromic catgut stitches in an interrupted pattern. The same steps were repeated on the right side. Dry sterile dressings were applied and the patient was fitted with a scrotal support. The surgery was finished."
