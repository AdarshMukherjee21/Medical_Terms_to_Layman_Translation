  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT KNEE CLINICAL:This is a 41 -year-old-male with knee pain, mobility loss and swelling. The patient had a twisting injury one week ago on 8/5/05. The examination was performed on 8/10/05 FINDINGS: There is intrasubstance degeneration within the medial meniscus without a discrete surfacing tear. There is intrasubstance degeneration within the lateral meniscus, and there is a probable small tear in the anterior horn along the undersurface at the meniscal root. There is an interstitial sprain/partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. There is no complete tear or discontinuity, and the ligament has a celery stick appearance. Normal posterior cruciate ligament. Normal medial collateral ligament. There is a sprain of the femoral attachment of the fibular collateral ligament, without complete tear or discontinuity. The fibular attachment is intact. Normal biceps femoris tendon, popliteus tendon and iliotibial band. Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons. There are no fractures. There is arthrosis, with high-grade changes in the patellofemoral compartment, particularly along the midline patellar ridge and lateral facet. There are milder changes within the medial femorotibial compartments. There are subcortical cystic changes subjacent to the tibial spine, which appear chronic. There is a joint effusion. There is synovial thickening. IMPRESSION: Probable small tear in the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus at the meniscal root. Interstitial sprain/partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. Arthrosis, joint effusion and synovial hypertrophy. There are several areas of focal prominent medullary fat within the medial and lateral femoral condyles.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the left knee  \nCLINICAL: A 41‑year‑old man has knee pain, trouble moving it, and swelling. He twisted his knee a week ago on 8/5/05. The MRI was done on 8/10/05.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n- The inside of the medial meniscus (the cartilage on the inner side of the knee) is worn out, but there is no clear tear on the surface.  \n- The inside of the lateral meniscus (the cartilage on the outer side) is also worn out, and there is a likely small tear at the front part of the meniscus near its root.  \n- The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has a small, partial tear inside it. It is not completely torn; it looks like a “celery stick.”  \n- The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is normal.  \n- The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is normal.  \n- The fibular collateral ligament (also called the lateral collateral ligament) is sprained at the point where it attaches to the femur, but it is not completely torn. The attachment on the fibula is intact.  \n- The biceps femoris tendon, popliteus tendon, and iliotibial band are normal.  \n- The quadriceps and patellar tendons are normal.  \n- No fractures are seen.  \n- There is arthritis (arthrosis). The changes are severe in the patellofemoral joint (the area where the kneecap meets the thigh bone), especially along the middle ridge of the kneecap and the outer part. The changes in the inner part of the knee joint are milder.  \n- There are cyst‑like changes under the bone near the tibial spine that look old (chronic).  \n- The joint has fluid buildup (effusion).  \n- The lining of the joint (synovium) is thickened.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n- A likely small tear at the front of the lateral meniscus near its root.  \n- A partial tear inside the ACL.  \n- Arthritis, fluid in the joint, and thickened joint lining.  \n- Several spots of prominent fat inside the inner and outer parts of the femur."
