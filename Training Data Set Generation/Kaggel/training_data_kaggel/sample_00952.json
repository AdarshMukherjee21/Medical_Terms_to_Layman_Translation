  "medical": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bright red blood per rectum HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 73-year-old woman had a recent medical history significant for renal and bladder cancer, deep venous thrombosis of the right lower extremity, and anticoagulation therapy complicated by lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Colonoscopy during that admission showed internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, but a bleeding site was not identified. Five days after discharge to a nursing home, she again experienced bloody bowel movements and returned to the emergency department for evaluation. REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS: No chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness. Positive for generalized weakness and diarrhea the day of admission. PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY: Long-standing hypertension, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia. Renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell bladder cancer status post left nephrectomy, radical cystectomy, and ileal loop diversion 6 weeks prior to presentation, postoperative course complicated by pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and retroperitoneal bleed. Deep venous thrombosis 2 weeks prior to presentation, management complicated by lower gastrointestinal bleeding, status post inferior vena cava filter placement. MEDICATIONS: Diltiazem 30 mg tid, pantoprazole 40 mg qd, epoetin alfa 40,000 units weekly, iron 325 mg bid, cholestyramine. Warfarin discontinued approximately 10 days earlier. ALLERGIES: Celecoxib (rash). SOCIAL HISTORY: Resided at nursing home. Denied alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory. PHYSICAL EXAM: Temp = 38.3C BP =146/52 HR= 113 RR = 18 SaO2 = 98% room air General: Pale, ill-appearing elderly female. HEENT: Pale conjunctivae, oral mucous membranes moist. CVS: Irregularly irregular, tachycardia. Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, gross blood on rectal exam. Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Skin: Warm, normal turgor. Neuro: Alert and oriented. Nonfocal. LABS: CBC: WBC count: 6,500 per mL Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL Hematocrit:31.8% Platelet count: 248 per mL Mean corpuscular volume: 86.5 fL RDW: 18% CHEM 7: Sodium: 131 mmol/L Potassium: 3.5 mmol/L Chloride: 98 mmol/L Bicarbonate: 23 mmol/L BUN: 11 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL Glucose: 105 mg/dL COAGULATION STUDIES: PT 15.7 sec INR 1.6 PTT 29.5 sec HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient received 1 liter normal saline and diltiazem (a total of 20 mg intravenously and 30 mg orally) in the emergency department. Emergency department personnel made several attempts to place a nasogastric tube for gastric lavage, but were unsuccessful. During her evaluation, the patient was noted to desaturate to 80% on room air, with an increase in her respiratory rate to 34 breaths per minute. She was administered 50% oxygen by nonrebreadier mask, with improvement in her oxygen saturation to 89%. Computed tomographic angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted to the medicine service for further workup and management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypoxia. She was alert, awake, and hemodynamically stable, but remained tachypneic and hypoxic despite high-flow oxygen. She continued to perseverate on the fact that she had been unable to swallow the nasogastric tube earlier in the evening &quot;even with that banana spray&quot; (topical benzocaine 20%). While obtaining a sample for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, the medical team noted that the blood was abnormally dark. The sample was sent for co-oximetry as well, which revealed a methemoglobin level of 15.2%. ABG showed a pH of 7.41, PCO2 31 mmHg, PO2 374 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient was treated with methylene blue, with rapid resolution of tachypnea and improvement of oxygen saturation to 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nBright red blood coming out of the rectum.\n\n**History of Present Illness**  \nA 73‑year‑old woman had kidney and bladder cancer, a blood clot in her right leg, and was on blood‑thinning medication that caused bleeding in her lower gut. During that hospital stay, a colonoscopy found hemorrhoids and diverticulosis but did not locate the bleeding source. Five days after she was sent to a nursing home, she had bloody stools again and went to the emergency department.\n\n**Review of Symptoms**  \nShe had no chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. She felt weak and had diarrhea on the day she was admitted.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \n- Long‑standing high blood pressure  \n- Occasional atrial fibrillation  \n- High cholesterol  \n- Kidney cancer and bladder cancer removed 6 weeks ago (left kidney removed, bladder removed, and an ileal loop diversion created). After surgery she had pneumonia, a urinary tract infection, and bleeding behind the abdomen.  \n- Blood clot in her leg 2 weeks ago; treated with a filter in the inferior vena cava.  \n- The blood‑thinning medication caused lower gut bleeding.\n\n**Medications**  \n- Diltiazem 30 mg three times a day  \n- Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day  \n- Epoetin alfa 40,000 units weekly  \n- Iron 325 mg twice a day  \n- Cholestyramine  \n- Warfarin was stopped about 10 days earlier.\n\n**Allergies**  \nRash to celecoxib.\n\n**Social History**  \nLives in a nursing home. No alcohol, tobacco, or drug use.\n\n**Family History**  \nNot relevant.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- Temperature 38.3 °C (100.94 °F)  \n- Blood pressure 146/52 mm Hg  \n- Heart rate 113 bpm (irregular, fast)  \n- Respirations 18/min  \n- Oxygen saturation 98 % on room air  \n- Pale, ill‑looking elderly woman  \n- Eyes: pale conjunctivae  \n- Mouth: moist mucous membranes  \n- Heart: irregular rhythm, tachycardia  \n- Lungs: decreased breath sounds at the bases  \n- Abdomen: normal bowel sounds, soft, no pain or swelling, blood seen on rectal exam  \n- Extremities: no cyanosis, clubbing, or swelling  \n- Skin: warm, normal elasticity  \n- Neurologic: alert, oriented, no focal deficits\n\n**Laboratory Results**  \n- CBC: WBC 6,500/µL; hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL; hematocrit 31.8 %; platelets 248,000/µL; MCV 86.5 fL; RDW 18 %  \n- Chemistry: sodium 131 mmol/L; potassium 3.5 mmol/L; chloride 98 mmol/L; bicarbonate 23 mmol/L; BUN 11 mg/dL; creatinine 1.1 mg/dL; glucose 105 mg/dL  \n- Coagulation: PT 15.7 sec; INR 1.6; PTT 29.5 sec\n\n**Hospital Course**  \nIn the emergency department she received 1 L of normal saline and diltiazem (20 mg IV and 30 mg PO). The team tried to place a nasogastric tube for stomach lavage but could not. She desaturated to 80 % on room air and breathed 34 breaths per minute. She was given 50 % oxygen by a non‑rebreather mask, which raised saturation to 89 %. A CT angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism. She was admitted to medicine for gastrointestinal bleeding and low oxygen.\n\nShe was alert, awake, and hemodynamically stable, but remained breathing fast and low oxygen despite high‑flow oxygen. She repeatedly mentioned she could not swallow the nasogastric tube earlier, even with banana spray (topical benzocaine 20 %). While drawing a blood sample for arterial blood gas, the blood was unusually dark. The sample was sent for co‑oximetry, revealing a methemoglobin level of 15.2 %. The arterial blood gas showed pH 7.41, PCO₂ 31 mmHg, PO₂ 374 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 99 %. She was treated with methylene blue, after which her breathing improved quickly and her oxygen saturation rose to 97 % on 2 L nasal cannula."
