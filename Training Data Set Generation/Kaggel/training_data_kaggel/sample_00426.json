  "medical": "MYOVIEW NUCLEAR STRESS STUDY REASON FOR THE TEST: Angina, coronary artery disease. FINDINGS: The patient exercised according to the Lexiscan nuclear stress study, received a total of 0.4 mg of Lexiscan. At peak hyperemic effect, 25.8 mCi of Myoview injected for the stress imaging and earlier 8.1 mCi of Myoview injected for the resting and the usual SPECT and gated SPECT protocol was followed in the rest-stress sequence. The data analyzed using Cedars-Sinai software. The resting heart rate was 49 with the resting blood pressure of 149/86. Maximum heart rate achieved was 69 with a maximum blood pressure achieved of 172/76. EKG at rest showed to be abnormal with sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and inverted T-wave in 1, 2, and aVL as well as from V4 to V6 with LVH. Maximal stress test EKG showed no change from baseline. IMPRESSION: Maximal Lexiscan stress test with abnormal EKG at baseline maximal stress test, please refer to the Myoview interpretation. MYOVIEW INTERPRETATIONS FINDINGS: The left ventricle appears to be dilated on both stress and rest with no significant change between stress and rest with left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 227, end-systolic volume of 154 with moderately to severely reduced LV function with akinesis of the inferior and inferoseptal wall. EF was calculated at 32%, estimated 35% to 40%. Cardiac perfusion reviewed, showed a large area of moderate-to-severe intensity in the inferior wall and small-to-medium area of severe intensity at the apex and inferoapical wall. Both defects showed no change on the resting indicative of a fixed defect in the inferior and inferoapical wall consistent with old inferior inferoapical MI. No reversible defects indicative of myocardium at risk. The lateral walls as well as the septum and most of the anterior wall showed no reversibility and near-normal perfusion. IMPRESSION: 1. Large fixed defect, inferior and apical wall, related to old myocardial infarction. 2. No reversible ischemia identified. 3. Moderately reduced left ventricular function with ejection fraction of about 35% consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the test:**  \nThe test was done because the patient has chest pain (angina) and suspected coronary artery disease.\n\n**What was done:**  \nThe patient exercised while receiving 0.4 mg of Lexiscan.  \nDuring the peak effect of Lexiscan, 25.8 mCi of Myoview was injected for the stress images, and 8.1 mCi was injected earlier for the resting images.  \nThe usual SPECT and gated SPECT imaging protocol was followed.  \nThe images were analyzed with Cedars‑Sinai software.\n\n**Heart measurements:**  \n- Resting heart rate: 49 beats per minute  \n- Resting blood pressure: 149/86 mm Hg  \n- Max heart rate during exercise: 69 bpm  \n- Max blood pressure during exercise: 172/76 mm Hg  \n\n**EKG results:**  \n- At rest, the EKG was abnormal: sinus rhythm, enlarged left atrium, inverted T‑waves in leads I, II, aVL, V4‑V6, and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).  \n- During the stress test, the EKG did not change from the baseline.\n\n**Overall impression of the stress test:**  \nThe patient had a maximal Lexiscan stress test with an abnormal resting EKG. See the detailed Myoview interpretation below.\n\n---\n\n### Myoview interpretation\n\n**Heart size and function:**  \n- The left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) is enlarged both at rest and during stress.  \n- Left ventricular end‑diastolic volume: 227 mL  \n- End‑systolic volume: 154 mL  \n- The heart’s pumping ability is moderately to severely reduced.  \n- The wall in the lower (inferior) and lower‑front (inferoseptal) area does not move (akinesis).  \n- Ejection fraction (EF) – the percentage of blood pumped out with each beat – is about 32 % (estimated 35‑40 %).\n\n**Blood flow to the heart muscle:**  \n- A large area in the lower wall shows moderate‑to‑severe reduced blood flow.  \n- A small‑to‑medium area at the tip (apex) and lower‑front wall shows severe reduced blood flow.  \n- These areas did not improve at rest, indicating they are fixed defects from an old heart attack (myocardial infarction) in the inferior and inferoapical walls.  \n- No reversible defects were seen, meaning there is no current area at risk of reduced blood flow.  \n- The side walls, the septum, and most of the front wall have normal or near‑normal blood flow.\n\n**Final impression:**  \n1. Large fixed defects in the lower and tip walls due to an old heart attack.  \n2. No reversible ischemia (no current danger of reduced blood flow).  \n3. Moderately reduced heart pumping function (EF ~35 %) consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy."
