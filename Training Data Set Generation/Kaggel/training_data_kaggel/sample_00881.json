  "medical": "EXAM: Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound for deep venous thrombus. REASON FOR EXAM: Lower extremity edema bilaterally. TECHNIQUE: Colored, grayscale, and Doppler imaging is all employed. FINDINGS: This examination is limited. There is prominent edema bilaterally and there is large body habitus. These two limit assessment especially of the right lower extremity. As visualized, there is no gross evidence of DVT. The right leg grayscale images are limited. No obvious clot identified on the color flow or Doppler images. The left leg is better visualized than the right, but again is limited. No definite clot is seen. IMPRESSION: Limited study secondary to body habitus and edema. No obvious DVT as visualized.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Ultrasound of both legs to look for deep vein clots.  \nREASON FOR EXAM: Swelling in both legs.  \nTECHNIQUE: The scan used color, gray‑scale, and Doppler imaging.  \nFINDINGS: The study was limited. Both legs have a lot of swelling and the person is very large, which made it hard to see, especially the right leg. From what could be seen, there is no obvious deep vein clot. The right leg images were not clear, but no clot was seen on the color or Doppler images. The left leg was a little easier to see, but still limited. No clot was found.  \nIMPRESSION: The study was limited because of the person's size and swelling. No clear deep vein clot was seen."
