Open reduction and internal screw fixation right fifth metatarsal. 2. Application of short leg splint. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 32-year-old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal. The patient relates that approximately in mid-June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot. She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain. She was recently seen by Dr. X and was referred to Dr. Y for surgery. The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. Y. The consent is available on the chart for review. The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position. A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected. Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base. The Xi-scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal. An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized. The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial. There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view. A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve. A linear incision was created with a #10 blade. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue. All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery. Next, using combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the deep fascia was reached. Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a #15 blade. Next, using a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone. The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus. A #25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy. The fracture site was easily found. An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis. A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone. Next, a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone. Next, a #1.0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone. Next, a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced. Next, a threaded K-wire was thrown from the proximal base of the fifth metatarsal across the fracture site distally. A #4-0 mm Synthes partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw was thrown using standard AO technique from the proximal fifth metatarsal base down the shaft and the fracture site was fixated rigidly. All this was done under fluoroscopy. Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The fracture site was found to have rigid compression. The hypertrophic bone on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal was reduced with a ball burr and the wound was again flushed. Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that were stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were reattached carefully with Vicryl. Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted suture technique. Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress technique. A postoperative fluoroscopic x-ray was taken and the bony alignment was found to be intact and the screw placement had excellent appearance. A dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4x4s, fluff, and Kerlix were applied. A sterile stockinet was applied over the foot. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied to pad all bony prominences. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits. Next, 4-inch, pre-moulded, well-padded posterior splint was applied. The capillary refill time of the digits was less than three seconds. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. After anesthesia was reversed, she was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She was given Vicodin 5/500 mg #30 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain, Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c., Keflex 500 mg #30 one p.o. t.i.d., till gone. She was given standard postoperative instructions to be non-weightbearing and was dispensed with crutches. She will rest, ice, and elevate her right leg. She is to follow up in the clinic on 08/26/03 at 10:30 a.m.. She was given emergency contact numbers and will call or return if problems arise earlier.",

Open surgery to straighten the bone and put a screw in the right fifth toe bone.  \n2. A short‑leg splint was put on.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** IV drugs and local block.  \n\n**History:**  \nA 32‑year‑old woman came to the pre‑op area after not eating or drinking since midnight. She is having surgery to fix a break in the base of her right fifth toe bone. She said that in mid‑June she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel when a heavy set of tools fell on her right foot. She kept walking on the foot and only noticed pain later. She was first seen by Dr. X and then referred to Dr. Y for surgery. Dr. Y explained the risks and benefits of the operation in detail and the patient gave written consent, which is on file. A urine test for pregnancy was negative.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter IV access was set up, the patient was taken to the operating room and lay on her back. A safety strap was put around her waist. A lot of Webril (a pain‑relief cream) was applied to her right ankle and a pneumatic tourniquet was put on her ankle. The anesthesiologist gave her IV sedation and then injected 10 cc of 0.5 % plain Marcaine (a local anesthetic) around the area of the right fifth toe bone.  \n\nThe foot was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. An Esmarch bandage was used to remove blood from the foot and the tourniquet was set to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered into the surgical field and a sterile stocking was pulled back. The surgeon looked at the base of the right fifth toe bone with a scanner and X‑ray machine. The break was an avulsion fracture at the base of the bone, running from the outer side near the tip to the inner side near the heel. A small gap (pseudoarthrosis) was seen on the side view.  \n\nThe surgeon marked the important structures (the peroneus longus and brevis tendons and the sural nerve) on the skin. A straight incision was made with a #10 blade, then deepened with a #15 blade. Small veins were tied off with electrocautery. Using sharp and blunt tools, the deep fascia was reached. A capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade. The tissue covering the bone was peeled back with a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade. The fracture site was not clear because of callus, so a #25 gauge needle was guided into the fracture under X‑ray. The pseudoarthrosis was separated with an osteotome and the excess bone was removed with a curette and a small ball burr.  \n\nA #1.0 drill bit was used to drill into healthy bone on either side of the fracture. The fracture was then aligned and held with a threaded K‑wire from the base of the bone to the tip. A partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw (size #4‑0 mm) was inserted from the base of the bone down the shaft to fix the fracture firmly. All of this was checked with X‑ray.  \n\nThe wound was washed with sterile saline. The bone was compressed firmly. The excess bone on the outer side was removed again with a ball burr and the wound was washed again. The capsuloperiosteal tissue was closed with #3‑0 Vicryl in simple interrupted stitches. A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that had been stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were re‑attached with Vicryl. The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4‑0 Vicryl in simple interrupted stitches. The skin was closed with #5‑0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress stitch.  \n\nA post‑op X‑ray showed the bone was straight and the screw was in good position. A dressing of Owen silk, 4 × 4s, fluff, and Kerlix was applied. A sterile stocking was put over the foot. More Webril was applied to cover all bony points. The tourniquet was released and the toes flushed with blood. A 4‑inch, pre‑molded, well‑padded posterior splint was put on. The toes had good capillary refill (<3 s).  \n\nThe patient had no complications from the anesthesia or the surgery. After the anesthesia wore off, she was taken to the recovery unit with stable vital signs and good blood flow to the right foot.  \n\n**Medications given:**  \n- Vicodin 5/500 mg, 30 tablets, take 1–2 tablets by mouth every 4–6 h as needed for pain.  \n- Naprosyn 500 mg, take 2 tablets by mouth after meals.  \n- Keflex 500 mg, 30 tablets, take 1 tablet by mouth three times a day until finished.  \n\n**Post‑op instructions:**  \n- Do not put weight on the foot.  \n- Use crutches.  \n- Rest, ice, and keep the right leg elevated.  \n- Follow up in clinic on 08/26/03 at 10:30 a.m.  \n- Emergency contact numbers were given; call or return if any problems arise earlier."
