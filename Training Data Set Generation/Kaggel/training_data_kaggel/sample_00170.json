  "medical": "EXAM:MRI RIGHT SHOULDER CLINICAL: A 32-year-old male with shoulder pain. FINDINGS: This is a second opinion interpretation of the examination performed on 02/16/06. Normal supraspinatus tendon without surface fraying, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy. Normal infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. Normal long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove. There is no subluxation of the tendon under the transverse humeral ligament and the intracapsular portion of the tendon is normal. Normal humeral head without fracture or subluxation. There is myxoid degeneration within the superior labrum (oblique coronal images #47-48), but there is no discrete tear. The remaining portions of the labrum are normal without osseous Bankart lesion. Normal superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments. There is a persistent os acromiale, and there is minimal reactive marrow edema on both sides of the synchondrosis, suggesting that there may be instability (axial images #3 and 4). There is no diastasis of the acromioclavicular joint itself. There is mild narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to the os acromiale, in the appropriate clinical setting, this may be acting as an impinging lesion (sagittal images #56-59). Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments. There are no effusions or masses. IMPRESSION: Changes in the superior labrum compatible with degeneration without a discrete surfacing tear. There is a persistent os acromiale, and there is reactive marrow edema on both sides of the synchondrosis suggesting instability. There is also mild narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to the os acromiale. This may be acting as an impinging lesion in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no evidence of a rotator cuff tear.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the right shoulder  \nCLINICAL: 32‑year‑old man with shoulder pain.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n- The supraspinatus tendon looks normal – no fraying, gaps, or pull‑back of fibers, and the muscle is not wasting.  \n- The infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons are normal.  \n- The long head of the biceps tendon is normal inside the bicipital groove.  \n- The tendon does not slip under the transverse humeral ligament, and the part inside the joint is normal.  \n- The humeral head (the ball of the shoulder joint) is normal – no break or slip.  \n- The upper part of the labrum (the cartilage rim of the socket) shows some soft, jelly‑like degeneration on images #47‑48, but there is no clear tear.  \n- The rest of the labrum is normal and there is no bone Bankart lesion.  \n- The upper, middle, and lower glenohumeral ligaments are normal.  \n- There is a persistent os acromiale (a small extra bone piece at the top of the shoulder). There is slight bone marrow swelling on both sides of this joint, suggesting it might be a bit unstable (images #3‑4).  \n- The acromioclavicular joint itself is not separated.  \n- The space under the acromion (subacromial space) is slightly narrowed because of the os acromiale; in this patient’s situation it could be causing impingement (images #56‑59).  \n- The coracoacromial, coracohumeral, and coracoclavicular ligaments are normal.  \n- No fluid build‑up or masses are seen.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n- The upper labrum shows degeneration but no tear.  \n- The persistent os acromiale and the bone marrow swelling on both sides suggest some instability.  \n- The narrowed subacromial space due to the os acromiale may be impinging on structures in this patient.  \n- No rotator cuff tear is seen."
