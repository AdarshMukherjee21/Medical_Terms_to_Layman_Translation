ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 250 cc. OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the hospital after a fall, presenting with neck and arm pain as well as weakness. His MRI confirmed significant neurologic compression in the cervical spine, combined with a clinical exam consistent with radiculopathy, myelopathy, and weakness. We discussed the diagnosis and the treatment options. Due to the severity of his neurologic symptoms as well as the amount of neurologic compression seen radiographically, I recommended that he proceed with surgical intervention as opposed to standard nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections. I explained the surgery itself which will be to remove pressure from the spinal cord via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4 and C4-C5. We reviewed the surgery itself as well as risks including infection and blood vessels or nerves, leakage of spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, failure of the pain to improve, possible worsening of the pain, failure of the neurologic symptoms to improve, possible worsening of the neurologic symptoms, and possible need for further surgery including re-revision and/or removal. Furthermore I explained that the fusion may not become solid or that the hardware could break. We discussed various techniques available for obtaining fusion and I recommended allograft and plate fixation. I explained the rationale for this as well as the options of using his own bone. Furthermore, I explained that removing motion at the fusion sites will transfer stress to other disc levels possibly accelerating there degeneration and causing additional symptoms and/or necessitating additional surgery in the future. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: After obtaining the appropriate signed and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without complications. He was then positioned supine on the operating table, and all bony prominences were padded. Pulse oximetry was maintained on both feet throughout the case. The arms were carefully padded and tucked at his sides. A roll was placed between the shoulder blades. The areas of the both ears were sterilely prepped and cranial tongs were applied in routine fashion. Ten pounds of traction was applied. A needle was taped to the anterior neck and an x-ray was done to determine the appropriate level for the skin incision. The entire neck was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A transverse skin incision was made and carried down to the platysma muscle. This was then split in line with its fibers. Blunt dissection was carried down medial to the carotid sheath and lateral to the trachea and esophagus until the anterior cervical spine was visualized. A needle was placed into a disc and an x-ray was done to determine its location. The longus colli muscles were then elevated bilaterally with the electrocautery unit. Self-retaining retractors were placed deep to the longus colli muscle in an effort to avoid injury to the sympathetic chains. Radical anterior discectomies were performed at C3-C4 and C4-C5. This included complete removal of the anterior annulus, nucleus, and posterior annulus. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed as were the posterior osteophytes. Foraminotomies were then accomplished bilaterally. Once all of this was accomplished, the blunt-tip probe was used to check for any residual compression. The central canal was wide open at each level as were the foramen. A high-speed bur was used to remove the cartilaginous endplates above and below each interspace. Bleeding cancellous bone was exposed. The disc spaces were measured and appropriate size allografts were placed sterilely onto the field. After further shaping of the grafts with the high-speed bur, they were carefully impacted in to position. There was good juxtaposition against the bleeding decorticated surfaces and good distraction of each interspace. All weight was then removed from the crania tongs. The appropriate size anterior cervical locking plate was chosen and bent into gentle lordosis. Two screws were then placed into each of the vertebral bodies at C3, C4, and C5. There was excellent purchase. A final x-ray was done confirming good position of the hardware and grafts. The locking screws were then applied, also with excellent purchase. Following a final copious irrigation, there was good hemostasis and no dural leaks. The carotid pulse was strong. A drain was placed deep to the level of the platysma muscle and left at the level of the hardware. The wounds were then closed in layers using 4-0 Vicryl suture for the platysma muscle, 4-0 Vicryl suture for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4-0 Vicryl suture in a subcuticular skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed followed by application of a sterile dressing. The drain was hooked to bulb suction. A Philadelphia collar was applied. The cranial tongs were carefully removed. The soft tissue overlying the puncture site was massaged to free it up from the underlying bone. There was good hemostasis. The patient was then carefully returned to the supine position on his hospital bed where he was reversed and extubated and taken to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well.",

An MRI showed that the spinal cord in his neck was being squeezed, and a physical exam matched this finding. We talked about the diagnosis and all treatment options. Because his neurological symptoms were severe and the imaging showed a lot of compression, I advised surgery instead of non‑surgical options such as physical therapy, medication, or steroid shots. I explained that the surgery would remove pressure on the spinal cord by cutting out the front part of the discs at C3‑C4 and C4‑C5 and then fusing those levels together. I reviewed the risks, including infection, damage to blood vessels or nerves, leaking spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, pain not improving or getting worse, neurological problems not improving or getting worse, and the possibility of needing more surgery later (such as a second operation or removal of hardware). I also explained that the fusion might not heal properly or the metal hardware could break. We discussed different ways to achieve fusion and I recommended using donor bone and a plate. I explained why this was chosen and mentioned the option of using the patient’s own bone. I also warned that stopping motion at the fused levels would shift stress to the other discs, possibly speeding up their wear and causing new symptoms or the need for future surgery.\n\n**OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE**  \nAfter the patient signed informed consent, he was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia with a breathing tube. He was placed on his back on the table, and all pressure points were padded. Pulse oximeters were attached to both feet. His arms were padded and tucked at his sides, and a roll was placed between his shoulder blades. The ears were cleaned and a head clamp was applied. Ten pounds of traction were used to pull the neck slightly. A needle was taped to the front of the neck and an X‑ray was taken to confirm the correct level for the incision. The entire neck was cleaned and draped. A horizontal skin cut was made and cut through the platysma muscle. The muscle was split along its fibers. A blunt dissection was carried out between the carotid sheath and the trachea and esophagus until the front of the cervical spine was seen. A needle was inserted into a disc and an X‑ray confirmed its location. The longus colli muscles were lifted on both sides with cautery. Self‑retaining retractors were placed behind the longus colli to protect the sympathetic nerves. The front part of the discs at C3‑C4 and C4‑C5 was removed completely, including the outer ring, the soft center, and the back ring. The posterior longitudinal ligament and bone spurs were taken out. The nerve exit holes were widened on both sides. A probe was used to check that no pressure remained on the spinal cord or nerves. The central canal and the foramen were open at each level. A high‑speed drill removed the cartilage from the top and bottom of each disc space, exposing bleeding bone. The disc spaces were measured and appropriately sized donor bone grafts were placed on the field. The grafts were shaped with the drill and carefully pressed into place. They fit well against the bleeding bone and the disc spaces were slightly separated. The traction was released. A suitable locking plate was chosen, bent into a gentle curve, and placed from C3 to C5. Two screws were inserted into each of the C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae. The screws held well. A final X‑ray confirmed the hardware and grafts were in good position. The locking screws were tightened. The area was irrigated thoroughly, bleeding was controlled, and no spinal fluid leak was seen. The carotid pulse was strong. A drain was placed behind the platysma muscle at the level of the hardware. The wound was closed in layers: 4‑0 Vicryl for the platysma, 4‑0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4‑0 Vicryl for the skin in a subcuticular stitch. Steri‑Strips were applied, followed by a sterile dressing. The drain was connected to suction. A Philadelphia collar was put on. The head clamp was removed. The soft tissue over the incision was massaged to separate it from the bone. Hemostasis was good. The patient was carefully turned back onto his back in bed, the breathing tube was removed, and he was taken to recovery where he tolerated the procedure well."
