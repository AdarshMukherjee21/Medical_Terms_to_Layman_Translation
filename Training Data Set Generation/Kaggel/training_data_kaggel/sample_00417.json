BRIEF HISTORY AND INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of right thoracic rib pain related to a herniated nucleus pulposus at T8-T9. She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms. For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic. She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected. Second check was made prior to prepping and draping. Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level. We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars. We dissected down carefully to identify the pars. We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level. We did this under live fluoroscopy. We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well. We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars. The pars was then drilled out. We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord. We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty. Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further. Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well. We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily. We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material. We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root. The Epstein curette removed some more disc material. Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression. We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure. We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure. Hemostasis was meticulous. The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied. Dressing was applied. The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition having tolerated the procedure well, to mobilize routinely when she is comfortable to go to her home.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Herniated disc at the T8‑T9 level of the spine.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same herniated disc at T8‑T9.  \n**Operation performed:** Right‑sided removal of the herniated disc at T8‑T9.  \n\n**Brief history and reason for surgery:**  \nThe patient is a 53‑year‑old woman who has had right‑side chest‑back pain caused by a herniated disc at T8‑T9. She tried non‑surgical treatments without relief and decided to have surgery to ease her symptoms.  \n\n**Description of the operation:**  \nThe patient gave informed consent and was taken to the operating room. She was put under general anesthesia and positioned comfortably on the table with all pressure points padded. A second check was done before cleaning and draping the area.  \n\nWe used a needle to locate the T8‑T9 level, checking the X‑rays from front and side several times. A midline incision was made, and we carefully dissected to find the pars (a part of the vertebra). We then identified the foramen (the opening for the nerve) and confirmed the level again with live X‑ray guidance.  \n\nUsing a surgical drill (Midas Rex), we removed the upper part of the pedicle and part of the transverse process to expose the disc. We saw the edge of the disc and removed some of the herniated material. We then removed the pars completely.  \n\nWe found the disc herniation pressing on the spinal cord. With small instruments, we removed the herniated disc material. We made a small cross‑shaped cut in the disc space and removed more disc material, ensuring nothing was left to herniate again. We checked the nerve root, removed any remaining disc fragments, and confirmed the nerve root was free.  \n\nWe used a curette and a nerve hook to clear the area, irrigated the wound thoroughly, and applied a steroid to the nerve root before closing. Hemostasis (stopping bleeding) was carefully achieved. The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl sutures for the deep tissue, two Vicryl sutures for the skin, and Monocryl plus Steri‑Strips. A dressing was applied.  \n\nThe patient woke up from anesthesia and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  \n\n**Estimated blood loss:** 150 mL.  \n**Complications:** None.  \n**Disposition:** The patient was sent to the post‑anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition, tolerated the procedure well, and was able to move around comfortably. She will go home when she feels ready."
