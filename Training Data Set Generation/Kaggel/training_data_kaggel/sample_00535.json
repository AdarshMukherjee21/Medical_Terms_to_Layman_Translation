  "medical": "CC: Horizontal diplopia. HX: This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia. PMH: 1)4Vessel CABG and pacemaker placement, 4/84. 2)Hypercholesterolemia. 3)Bipolar Affective D/O. FHX: HTN, Colon CA, and a daughter with unknown type of &quot;dystonia.&quot; SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. ROS: no recent weight loss/fever/chills/night sweats/CP/SOB. He occasionally experiences bilateral lower extremity cramping (?claudication) after walking for prolonged periods. MEDS: Lithium 300mg bid, Accupril 20mg bid, Cellufresh Ophthalmologic Tears, ASA 325mg qd. EXAM: BP216/108 HR72 RR14 Wt81.6kg T36.6C MS: unremarkable. CN: horizontal binocular diplopia on lateral gaze in both directions. No other CN deficits noted. Motor: 5/5 full strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: unremarkable. Coord: mild &quot;ataxia&quot; of RAM (left &gt; right) Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 symmetric throughout. Plantars (bilateral dorsiflexion) STUDIES/COURSE: Gen Screen: unremarkable. Brain CT revealed 1.0 x 1.5 cm area of calcific density within the medial two-thirds of the left cerebral peduncle. This shows no mass effect, but demonstrates mild contrast enhancement. There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma). No surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed. He was lost to follow-up in 1993.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Seeing double in a horizontal line.  \n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nA 67‑year‑old man first noticed horizontal double vision (diplopia) 25 years ago. It started suddenly and lasted for a year, occurring sometimes. He was checked twice for myasthenia gravis, but the doctors said he probably did not have it. He did not get any treatment and the double vision went away on its own. He was fine until about a year ago when the double vision came back suddenly. It happens every day for a few minutes at a time and goes away when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at far objects or things to the side. He has no other symptoms with the double vision.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1. Four‑vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and pacemaker placed in April 1984.  \n2. High cholesterol.  \n3. Bipolar disorder.  \n\n**Family History:**  \n- Father had high blood pressure.  \n- Mother had colon cancer.  \n- Daughter has an unknown type of “dystonia.”  \n\n**Social History:**  \nDoes not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.  \n\n**Review of Systems:**  \nNo recent weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  \nOccasional cramping in both legs after walking a long time (possible claudication).  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Lithium 300 mg twice daily  \n- Accupril (lisinopril) 20 mg twice daily  \n- Cellufresh eye drops  \n- Aspirin 325 mg once daily  \n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- Blood pressure 216/108 mm Hg, heart rate 72 bpm, respiratory rate 14/min, weight 81.6 kg, temperature 36.6 °C.  \n- Mental status normal.  \n- Cranial nerves: double vision when looking to the sides; no other nerve problems.  \n- Muscles: full strength (5/5) everywhere, normal size and tone.  \n- Sensation: normal.  \n- Coordination: mild unsteady movement of the right arm more than the left.  \n- No drift when holding arms out or standing on one foot.  \n- Walking normal.  \n- Reflexes: normal and symmetrical.  \n- Plantar responses: normal (downward).  \n\n**Studies/Course:**  \nA general blood screen was normal.  \nA brain CT scan showed a 1.0 × 1.5 cm calcified spot in the left part of the midbrain (cerebral peduncle). It does not press on other structures but shows slight contrast uptake. There are small low‑density patches in the white matter around the ventricles, typical of age‑related small vessel changes. The midbrain finding looks most like a hemangioma (a benign blood vessel tumor); a low‑grade astrocytoma could also fit but usually shows less contrast. Metastatic tumors could calcify but usually have swelling around them. Because the patient has had symptoms for a long time, a hemangioma is the most likely explanation. No surgery or further imaging was done; the patient was simply monitored. He was lost to follow‑up in 1993."
