  "medical": "Recent diagnosis of left breast cancer. Evaluate malignancy. Bilateral breast MRI with & without IV contrast comparison study performed on 8/24/07 and 8/29/07. FINDINGS: There are post biopsy changes seen in the retroareolar region, middle third aspect of the left breast at the post biopsy site. There is abnormal enhancement seen in this location compatible with patients history of malignancy. There is increased enhancement seen in the inferior aspect of the left breast at the 6:00 oclock, N+5.5 cm position measuring 1.2 cm. Further work-up with ultrasound is indicated. There are other multiple benign appearing enhancing masses seen in both the right and left breasts. None of the remaining masses appear worrisome for malignancy based upon MRI criteria. IMPRESSION: BIRADS CATEGORY M/5 There is a malignant appearing area of enhancement in the left breast which does correspond to the patients history of recent diagnosis of malignancy. She has been scheduled to see a surgeon, as well as Medical Oncologist. Dedicated ultrasonography of the inferior aspect of the left breast should be performed at the 6:00 oclock, N+5.5 cm position for further evaluation of the mass. At that same time, ultrasonography of the remaining masses should also be performed. Please note, however that the remaining masses have primarily benign features based upon MRI criteria. However, further evaluation with ultrasound should be performed.",
  "layman": "Recent diagnosis of cancer in the left breast. A breast MRI was done with and without IV contrast on 8/24/07 and 8/29/07 to check for cancer.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- After the biopsy, there are changes in the area just behind the nipple (retroareolar region) in the middle third of the left breast.  \n- This area shows abnormal enhancement, which matches the patient’s history of cancer.  \n- There is also increased enhancement in the lower part of the left breast at the 6:00 o’clock position, 5.5 cm north of the nipple, measuring 1.2 cm. Ultrasound is needed to look at this spot.  \n- Several other masses in both breasts look benign on the MRI. None of these masses look suspicious for cancer based on MRI criteria.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- BIRADS category 5 (highly suggestive of cancer).  \n- The area of abnormal enhancement in the left breast matches the recent cancer diagnosis.  \n- The patient has been scheduled to see a surgeon and a medical oncologist.  \n- A dedicated ultrasound of the lower left breast at the 6:00 o’clock, 5.5 cm north position should be done to evaluate the mass.  \n- Ultrasound of the other masses should also be performed, even though they appear benign on MRI."
