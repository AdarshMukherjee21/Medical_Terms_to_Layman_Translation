  "medical": "EXAM: Coronary artery CTA with calcium scoring and cardiac function. HISTORY: Chest pain. TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Coronary artery CTA was performed on a Siemens dual-source CT scanner. Post-processing on a Vitrea workstation. 150 mL Ultravist 370 was utilized as the intravenous contrast agent. Patient did receive nitroglycerin sublingually prior to the contrast. HISTORY: Significant for high cholesterol, overweight, chest pain, family history Patient's total calcium score (Agatston) is 10. his places the patient just below the 75th percentile for age. The LAD has a moderate area of stenosis in its midportion due to a focal calcified plaque. The distal LAD was unreadable while the proximal was normal. The mid and distal right coronary artery are not well delineated due to beam-hardening artifact. The circumflex is diminutive in size along its proximal portion. Distal is not readable. Cardiac wall motion within normal limits. No gross pulmonary artery abnormality however they are not well delineated. A full report was placed on the patient's chart. Report was saved to PACS.",

The patient took nitroglycerin under the tongue before the contrast.  \n\nThe patient has high cholesterol, is overweight, has chest pain, and a family history of heart disease.  \nTotal calcium score (Agatston) is 10, which is just below the 75th percentile for his age.  \n\n- The left anterior descending artery (LAD) shows moderate narrowing in the middle because of a calcified plaque. The far end of the LAD could not be seen, but the near end is normal.  \n- The mid and far parts of the right coronary artery are unclear because of a beam‑hardening artifact.  \n- The circumflex artery is small in the near part; the far part could not be seen.  \n\nHeart wall motion is normal. No obvious problems were seen in the main pulmonary artery, but it was also not clearly visible. A full report was added to the patient’s chart and saved to PACS."
