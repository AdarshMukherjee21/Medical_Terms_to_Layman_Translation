  "medical": "CC: Falling to left. HX: 26y/oRHF fell and struck her head on the ice 3.5 weeks prior to presentation. There was no associated loss of consciousness. She noted a dull headache and severe sharp pain behind her left ear 8 days ago. The pain lasted 1-2 minutes in duration. The next morning she experienced difficulty walking and consistently fell to the left. In addition the left side of her face had become numb and she began choking on food. Family noted her pupils had become unequal in size. She was seen locally and felt to be depressed and admitted to a psychiatric facility. She was subsequently transferred to UIHC following evaluation by a local ophthalmologist. MEDS: Prozac and Ativan (both recently started at the psychiatric facility). PMH: 1) Right esotropia and hyperopia since age 1year. 2) Recurrent UTI. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Divorced. Lives with children. No spontaneous abortions. Denied ETOH/Tobacco/Illicit Drug use. EXAM: BP 138/110. HR 85. RR 16. Temp 37.2C. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Intact naming, comprehension, repetition. CN: Pupils 4/2 decreasing to 3/1 on exposure to light. Optic Disks flat. VFFTC. Esotropia OD, otherwise EOM full. Horizontal nystagmus on leftward gaze. Decreased corneal reflex, OS. Decreased PP/TEMP sensation on left side of face. Light touch testing normal. Decreased gag response on left. Uvula deviates to right. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: Decreased PP and TEMP on right side of body. PROP/VIB intact. Coord: Difficulty with FNF/HKS/RAM on left. Normal on right side. Station: No pronator drift. Romberg test not noted. Gait: unsteady with tendency to fall to left. Reflexes: 3/3 throughout BUE and Patellae. 2+/2+ Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: Obese. In no acute distress. Otherwise unremarkable. HEENT: No carotid/vertebral/cranial bruits. COURSE: PT/PTT, GS, CBC, TSH, FT4 and Cholesterol screen were all within normal limits. HCT on admission was negative. MRI Brain (done locally 2/2/93) was reviewed and a left lateral medullary stroke was appreciated. The patient underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/3/93 which revealed significant narrowing of the left vertebral artery beginning at C2 and extending to and involving the basilar artery. There is severe, irregular narrowing of the horizontal portion above the posterior arch of C1. The findings were felt consistent with a left vertebral artery dissection. Neuro-opthalmology confirmed a left Horner's pupil by clinical exam and history. Cookie swallow study was unremarkable. The Patient was placed on Heparin then converted to Coumadin. The PT on discharge was 17. She remained on Coumadin for 3 months and then was switched to ASA for 1 year. An Otolaryngologic evaluation on 10/96 noted true left vocal cord paralysis with full glottic closure. A prosthesis was made and no surgical invention was done.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint**  \nShe keeps falling to the left.\n\n**History**  \nA 26‑year‑old right‑handed woman fell and hit her head on ice 3½ weeks ago. She did not lose consciousness. Eight days after the fall she had a dull headache and a sharp pain behind her left ear that lasted 1–2 minutes. The next morning she had trouble walking and kept falling to the left. Her left face became numb and she started choking on food. Family noticed her pupils were unequal. She was first seen at a local clinic, was thought to be depressed, and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. After an eye doctor examined her, she was transferred to UIHC.\n\n**Medications**  \nProzac and Ativan – both started recently at the psychiatric hospital.\n\n**Past medical history**  \n1. Turning‑in eye (right esotropia) and farsightedness (hyperopia) since age 1.  \n2. Repeated urinary‑tract infections.\n\n**Family history**  \nNone notable.\n\n**Social history**  \nDivorced, lives with her children, no miscarriages, does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illegal drugs.\n\n---\n\n### Physical exam\n\n*Vitals* – BP 138/110, HR 85, RR 16, Temp 37.2 °C.  \n*Mental status* – Alert, oriented to person, place, and time. Speech clear. Naming, understanding, and repeating words were normal.\n\n*Cranial nerves* –  \n- Pupils 4 mm and 2 mm, constricting to 3 mm and 1 mm with light.  \n- Eye discs normal. Vision fine.  \n- Right eye turned inward (esotropia); eye movements otherwise normal.  \n- When looking left, eyes made a quick, involuntary motion (horizontal nystagmus).  \n- Left cornea had a weaker blink reflex.  \n- Pain and temperature sensation reduced on the left side of the face.  \n- Light touch normal.  \n- Gag reflex weaker on the left.  \n- Uvula tilted to the right.  \n- All other cranial nerves normal.\n\n*Motor* – 5/5 strength everywhere, normal muscle size and tone.  \n*Sensory* – Pain and temperature reduced on the right side of the body; proprioception and vibration normal.  \n*Coordination* – Finger‑to‑nose, heel‑to‑shin, and rapid alternating movements were difficult on the left side but normal on the right. No pronator drift. Romberg test not performed.  \n*Gait* – Unsteady, keeps falling to the left.  \n*Reflexes* – 3/3 in both arms and knees, 2+/2+ in ankles. Plantar reflexes normal (flexor).\n\n*General* – Obese, not in acute distress. Head, ears, nose, throat exam normal; no abnormal sounds over neck arteries.\n\n---\n\n### Course and investigations\n\n*Blood tests* – PT, PTT, glucose, CBC, thyroid, cholesterol all normal. Hepatitis C test negative.  \n*Imaging* – MRI of the brain (Feb 2, 1993) showed a stroke in the left side of the brainstem (lateral medulla).  \n*Cerebral angiogram* (Feb 3, 1993) revealed a large narrowing of the left vertebral artery starting at the second cervical vertebra and extending into the basilar artery. The narrowing was severe and irregular above the back of the first cervical vertebra, suggesting a dissection of the left vertebral artery.  \n*Neuro‑ophthalmology* confirmed left Horner’s syndrome (pupil problem).  \n*Swallow test* with a cookie was normal.\n\n*Treatment* – Started on heparin, then switched to warfarin (Coumadin). PT at discharge was 17. She stayed on warfarin for three months and then switched to aspirin for one year.  \n*ENT evaluation* (Oct 1996) found true paralysis of the left vocal cord with full closure of the vocal folds. A prosthesis was made; no surgery was performed."
