  "medical": "I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. ABC in neurologic consultation and follow-up on MM/DD/YYYY. Mr. ABC reports that he has had several issues in the family. One of them is that his grandmother passed. In addition, the family dog fell ill. This has led to distress. He reports better controlled pain. Mr. ABC reports, otherwise, intermittent adherence to Copaxone. He had in the past been on interferon, but did not tolerate the medication, because of side effects. His sleep/wake cycle remains very erratic. SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Reviewed. There are no changes, otherwise. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Fatigue, pain, difficulty with sleep, mood fluctuations, low stamina, mild urgency frequency and hesitancy, preponderance of lack of stamina, preponderance of pain particularly in the left shoulder. EXAMINATION: The patient is alert and oriented. Extraocular movements are full. The face is symmetric. The uvula is midline. Speech has normal prosody. Today there is much less guarding of the left shoulder. In the lower extremities, iliopsoas, quadriceps, femoris and tibialis anterior are full. The gait is narrow based and noncircumductive. Rapid alternating movements are slightly off bilaterally. The gait does not have significant slapping characteristics. Sensory examination is largely unremarkable. Heart, lungs, and abdomen are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: Mr. ABC is doing about the same. We discussed the issue of adherence to Copaxone. In order to facilitate this, I would like him to take Copaxone every other day, but on a regular rhythm. His wife continues to inject him. He has not been able to start himself on the injections. Greater than 50% of this 40-minute appointment was devoted to counseling.",
  "layman": "I saw Mr. ABC for a neurology check‑up on MM/DD/YYYY. He told me that his family has had a few problems: his grandmother died and their family dog got sick, which has made him upset. He says his pain is better controlled now. Mr. ABC says he only sometimes takes his Copaxone medicine. He used to take interferon, but he couldn’t tolerate it because of side effects. His sleep pattern is still very irregular.\n\n**Social, family, and past medical history** were reviewed and there were no changes.\n\n**Review of systems**: He reports fatigue, pain, trouble sleeping, mood swings, low energy, mild urgency and hesitancy when he goes to the bathroom, and especially pain in his left shoulder.\n\n**Physical exam**: Mr. ABC is awake and aware. His eye movements are normal. His face is even. His uvula is in the middle. His speech sounds normal. He has less pain and guarding in his left shoulder today. His leg muscles (iliopsoas, quadriceps, femoris, tibialis anterior) are strong. He walks with a narrow base and does not swing his legs around. His quick alternating movements are a little off on both sides. His gait does not show big slapping. His sense of touch is mostly normal. His heart, lungs, and abdomen are all normal.\n\n**Impression**: Mr. ABC is about the same as before. We talked about how he can keep up with his Copaxone. To help, I suggested he take Copaxone every other day but on a regular schedule. His wife still does the injections for him; he hasn’t started doing them himself. More than half of the 40‑minute visit was spent counseling him."
