  "medical": "CC: Dysarthria HX: This 52y/o RHF was transferred from a local hospital to UIHC on 10/28/94 with a history of progressive worsening of vision, dysarthria, headache, and incoordination beginning since 2/94. Her husband recalled her first difficulties became noticeable after a motor vehicle accident in 2/94. She was a belted passenger in a car struck at a stop. There was no reported head or neck injury or alteration of consciousness. She was treated and released from a local ER the same day. Her husband noted the development of mild dysarthria, incoordination, headache and exacerbation of preexisting lower back pain within 2 week of the accident. In 4/94 she developed stress urinary incontinence which spontaneously resolved in June. In 8/94, her HA changed from a dull constant aching in the bitemporal region to a sharper constant pain in the nuchal/occipital area. She also began experiencing increased blurred vision, worsening dysarthria and difficulty hand writing. In 9/94 she was evaluated by a local physician. Examination then revealed incoordination, generalized fatigue, and dysarthria. Soon after this she became poorly arousable and increasingly somnolent. She had difficulty walking and generalized weakness. On 10/14/94, she lost the ability to walk by herself. Evaluation at a local hospital revealed: 1)Normal electronystagmography, 2)two lumbar punctures which revealed some atypical mononuclear cells suggestive of &quot;tumor or reactive lymphocytosis.&quot; One of these CSF analysis showed: Glucose 16, Protein 99, WBC 14, RBC 114. Echocardiogram was normal. Bone marrow biopsy was normal except for decreased iron. Abdominal-Pelvic CT scan, CXR, Mammogram, PPD, ANA, TFT, and RPR were unremarkable. A 10/31/94 MRI brain scan a 5x10mm area of increased signal on T2 weighted images in the right remporal lobe lateral to the anterior aspect of the temporal horn, right posterolateral aspect of the midbrain, pons, and bilateral inferior surface of the cerebellum involving gray and white matter. These areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast on T1 weighted images. MEDS: none. PMH: 1)G3P3, 2)last menses one year ago. FHX: Mother suffered stroke in her 70's. DM and Htn in family. SHX: Married, Secretary, No h/o tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. ROS: no weight loss, fever, chills, nightsweats, cough, dysphagia. EXAM: BP139/74, HR 90, RR20, 36.8C MS: Drowsy to somnolent, occasionally &quot;giddy.&quot; Oriented to person, place, time. Minimal dysarthric speech, but appropriate. MMSE 27/30 (copy of exam not in chart). CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Optic disks were flat and without sign of papilledema. VFFTC. EOM intact. No nystagmus. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout. Normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: No deficit to LT/PP/VIB/PROP. Coord: difficulty with RAM in BUE, and ataxia on FNF and HKS in all extremities. Station: Romberg sign present. Gait: unsteady, wide-based, with notable difficulty on TW, TT and HW. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE, 0/1 patellae, trace at both archilles, Plantars responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: CSF analysis by lumbar puncture, 10/31/94: Protein 131mg/dl (normal 15-45), Albumin 68 (normal 14-20), IgG10mg/dl (normal &lt;6.2), IgG index -O.1mg/24hr (normal), No oligoclonal bands seen, WBC 33 (19lymphocytes, 1 neutrophil), RBC 29, Glucose 13, Cultures (bacteria, fungal, AFB) were negative, crytococcal Ag negative. The elevated CSF total protein, IgG, and albumin suggested breakdown of the blood brain barrier or blockage of CSF flow. The normal IgG synthesis rate and lack of oligoclonal banding did not suggest demylination. A second CSF analysis on 11/2/94 revealed similar findings; and in addition Anti-purkinje cell and Anti-neuronal antibodies (Yo and Ho) were not found; Beta-2 microglobulin was 1.8 (normal); histoplasmosis Ag negative. Serum ACE, SPEP, Urine histoplasmin were negative. Neuropsychologic assessment, 10/28/94, raised a question of a demential syndrome, but given her response style on the MMPI (marked defensiveness, with unwillingness to admit to even very common human faults) prevented such a diagnosis. Severe defects in memory, fine motor skills, and constructional praxis were noted. Chest-Abdominal-Pelvic CT scans were negative. 11/4/94 cerebral angiogram noted variable caliber in the RMCA, LACA and Left AICA distributions. It was intially thought that thismight be suggestive of a vasculopathy and she was treated with a short course of IV steroids. Temporal artery biopsy was unremarkable. She underwent multiple MRI brain scans at UIHC: 11/4/94, 11/9/94, 11/16/94. All scans consistently showed increase in T2 signal in the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and temporal lobes bilaterally. These areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast. These findings were felt most suggestive of glioma. She underwent left temporal lobe brain biopsy on 11/10/94: This study was inconclusive and showed evidence of atypical mononuclear cells and lymphocytes in the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces. Despite cytologic atypia the cells were felt to be reactive in nature, since immunohistochemical stains failed to disclose lymphoid clonality or non-leukocytic phenomena. Little sign of vasculopathy or tumor was found. Bacterial, fungal , HSV, CMV and AFB cultures were negative. HSV, and VZV antigen was negative. Her neurological state progressively worsened throughout her hospital stay. By time of discharge, 12/2/94, she was very somnolent and difficult to arouse and required NGT feeding and 24hour supportive care. She was made DNR after family request prior to transfer to a care facility.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Difficulty speaking (dysarthria)\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nA 52‑year‑old woman with right‑hand dominance was moved from a local hospital to UIHC on October 28, 1994. She had been getting worse in her vision, speech, headaches, and coordination since February 1994. Her husband says the problems started after a car accident in February. She was a belted passenger when the car was hit at a stop. No head or neck injury or loss of consciousness was reported. She was treated and sent home from the ER that same day. Within two weeks of the crash she had mild speech difficulty, trouble coordinating movements, headaches, and worsening lower back pain. In April she had stress urinary incontinence that went away by June. In August her headache changed from a dull ache on both sides of the head to a sharp, constant pain at the back of her neck and skull. She also noticed more blurred vision, worse speech, and trouble writing. In September a local doctor examined her and found coordination problems, general fatigue, and speech difficulty. Soon after she became drowsy, hard to wake, had trouble walking, and felt weak all over. By October 14 she could no longer walk by herself. A local hospital did the following tests:  \n1. Normal eye‑movement test (electronystagmography).  \n2. Two lumbar punctures (spinal fluid tests) that showed some unusual white cells that could mean a tumor or a reactive immune response. One sample had: glucose 16, protein 99, 14 white cells, 114 red cells.  \n3. Normal heart ultrasound.  \n4. Bone marrow biopsy was normal except for low iron.  \n5. CT scan of abdomen/pelvis, chest X‑ray, mammogram, TB test, ANA, thyroid tests, and syphilis test were all normal.  \n6. An MRI on October 31 showed a 5 × 10 mm area of increased signal on T2 images in the right temporal lobe, right side of the midbrain, pons, and both lower parts of the cerebellum. These spots did not light up with contrast.  \n\n**Medications:** None.  \n**Past Medical History:** 3 pregnancies, 3 births; last period was a year ago.  \n**Family History:** Mother had a stroke in her 70s; diabetes and high blood pressure run in the family.  \n**Social History:** Married, works as a secretary, no tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.  \n**Review of Systems:** No weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, cough, or trouble swallowing.  \n\n**Physical Exam (October 28):**  \n- Blood pressure 139/74, heart rate 90, breathing 20, temperature 36.8 °C.  \n- Alert but drowsy, sometimes “giddy.” She knew who she was, where she was, and the time. Speech was slightly slurred but understandable.  \n- Mini‑mental exam 27/30.  \n- Eyes: pupils equal, 4 mm, constricting to light. Optic discs normal, no swelling. Vision normal. Extra‑ocular movements fine. No eye jerks.  \n- No other cranial nerve problems.  \n- Muscles: 5/5 strength everywhere, normal tone and size.  \n- Sensation: normal to light touch, pain, vibration, and proprioception.  \n- Coordination: trouble with rapid alternating movements in both arms, and ataxia on finger‑to‑nose and heel‑to‑shin tests in all limbs.  \n- Romberg sign positive (balance worsens when eyes closed).  \n- Gait: unsteady, wide‑based, difficulty turning, walking straight, and walking on heels.  \n- Reflexes: 2/2 in arms, 0/1 in knees, trace in ankles. Plantar reflexes flexor on both sides.  \n- General exam normal.  \n\n**Course of Illness:**  \n- Lumbar puncture on October 31: protein 131 mg/dL (high), albumin 68 (high), IgG 10 mg/dL (high), IgG index 0.1 (normal), no oligoclonal bands. White cells 33 (19 lymphocytes, 1 neutrophil), red cells 29, glucose 13. Cultures for bacteria, fungus, TB were negative; cryptococcal antigen negative. High protein, IgG, and albumin suggest the blood‑brain barrier is leaking or CSF flow is blocked. Normal IgG production and no bands do not suggest demyelination.  \n- Second lumbar puncture on November 2 had similar results; anti‑Purkinje cell and anti‑neuronal antibodies (Yo, Ho) were not found; beta‑2 microglobulin 1.8 (normal); histoplasmosis antigen negative.  \n- Serum ACE, SPEP, urine histoplasmin negative.  \n- Neuropsychology test on October 28 raised the possibility of dementia, but her defensive answers on the MMPI made that diagnosis unlikely. Severe memory, fine‑motor, and construction problems were noted.  \n- Chest, abdomen, pelvis CT scans were negative.  \n- Cerebral angiogram on November 4 showed variable vessel size in right middle cerebral artery, left anterior cerebral artery, and left anterior inferior cerebellar artery. It was thought this might be a blood vessel disease, so she got a short course of IV steroids. Temporal artery biopsy was normal.  \n- Multiple MRI scans on November 4, 9, and 16 all showed increased T2 signal in the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, and both temporal lobes, but no contrast enhancement. These findings were thought most like a glioma.  \n- She had a left temporal lobe brain biopsy on November 10. The study was inconclusive but showed atypical white cells and lymphocytes around blood vessels and in the outer brain space. Despite some abnormal cells, they were thought to be reactive because special stains did not show a cancerous or non‑white‑cell disease. Little evidence of vessel disease or tumor. Cultures for bacteria, fungus, HSV, CMV, TB were negative. HSV and VZV antigens negative.  \n- Her neurological condition got worse during her stay. By discharge on December 2 she was very drowsy, hard to wake, needed a feeding tube, and required 24‑hour support. She was made DNR after her family asked, before being transferred to a care facility."
