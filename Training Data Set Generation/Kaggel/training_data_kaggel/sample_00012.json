KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at T12 and L1evels Insertion of KYPHON HV-R bone cement under low pressure at T12 and L1 levels. 2. Bone biopsy (medically necessary). ANESTHESIA: General COMPLICATIONS: None BLOOD LOSS: Minimal INDICATIONS: Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating. She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics. She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note). Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2. In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture. Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures. Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1. Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1. The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old. The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity. Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed. The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table. The back was prepped and draped. The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker. In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate. An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side. Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane. Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed. A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex. AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory. Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made. The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place. The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle. Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall. Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel. The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex. After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex. The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images. The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body. Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi. Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position. The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging. The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left. There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body. Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved. Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement. The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side. Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed. At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12. An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved. Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning. Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures. The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection. She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor. She was moving both her lower extremities at this time. Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications. Estimated blood loss was minimal.",

KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at the T12 and L1 levels.  \n   • A low‑pressure KYPHON HV‑R bone cement was injected into each fractured vertebra.  \n2. A bone biopsy was taken (necessary for medical reasons).\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**  \nGeneral anesthesia.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:**  \nNone.\n\n**BLOOD LOSS:**  \nMinimal.\n\n---\n\n### INDICATIONS\n\nMrs. Smith is a 75‑year‑old woman who has had very bad back pain for about three months. The pain has stopped her from moving normally. She has tried bed rest and pain medicine, but nothing helped. She also takes medicines for COPD, diabetes, and high blood pressure.  \n\nX‑rays and an MRI show several compression fractures in the lower part of her spine (T12, L1, and L2). She also has a pronounced forward bend (kyphosis).  \n\n- **1/04 X‑ray:** L1 and L2 fractures.  \n- **2/04 X‑ray:** L1 height loss increased.  \n- **3/04 X‑ray:** New fracture at T12 and more collapse of L1.  \n- L2 fracture is old (at least a year).  \n- T12 fracture has the biggest kyphosis.  \n\nBecause of these findings, the doctors decided to do balloon kyphoplasty on the T12 and L1 fractures.\n\n---\n\n### PROCEDURE DETAILS\n\n1. **Preparation**  \n   • Mrs. Smith was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia.  \n   • She was placed face‑down (prone) on a special table.  \n   • The back was cleaned and covered.  \n   • A C‑arm X‑ray machine was set up to guide the surgery.  \n\n2. **T12 Surgery**  \n   • The doctors marked the T12 pedicle (the small bone that connects the spine to the vertebra).  \n   • An 11‑gauge needle was inserted through the pedicle into the vertebra.  \n   • The needle’s position was checked with X‑ray from front and side.  \n   • The needle was removed, leaving a guide wire.  \n   • A small incision (about 1 cm) was made beside the guide wire.  \n   • A special introducer was slid over the wire into the vertebra.  \n   • A drill was used to create a channel inside the vertebra.  \n   • A 15 mm inflatable balloon (tamp) was inserted and carefully inflated near the front of the vertebra.  \n   • The same steps were repeated on the left side of T12.  \n   • The balloons were inflated to a total volume of about 3.5 cc on the right and 3 cc on the left, restoring about 5 mm of height and straightening the fracture.  \n   • Low‑pressure bone cement (KYPHON HV‑R) was then injected to fill the space, hardening the cement.  \n   • The cement volume was 3.5 cc on the right and 3 cc on the left.  \n   • The needles were removed after the cement set.\n\n3. **L1 Surgery**  \n   • The same sequence was repeated at L1: needles, channel, balloon inflation, cement injection.  \n   • X‑ray was used throughout to confirm correct placement.\n\n4. **After the Procedure**  \n   • The small incisions were closed with stitches.  \n   • Mrs. Smith stayed face‑down for about 10 minutes, then was turned onto her back.  \n   • She was monitored briefly and then moved to the floor.  \n   • She could already move both legs.  \n\nNo complications happened during the surgery, and only a tiny amount of blood was lost."
