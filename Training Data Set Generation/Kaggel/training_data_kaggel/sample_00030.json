  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rule out temporal arteritis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rule out temporal arteritis. PROCEDURE: Bilateral temporal artery biopsy. ANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. INDICATIONS: I was consulted by Dr. X for this patient with bilateral temporal headaches to rule out temporal arteritis. I explained fully the procedure to the patient. PROCEDURE: Both sides were done exactly the same way. After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery. The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides. Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult. The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm. They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled. The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond. She tolerated the procedure well.",

I explained the procedure to her in detail.  \n\nPROCEDURE: The same steps were done on each side. After numbing the area with 1% Xylocaine, a 2‑ to 3‑centimeter cut was made over the temporal artery. The artery looked normal on both sides. The artery was tied off at the beginning and end with 3‑0 silk sutures and a Hemoccult strip. A piece of the artery, at least 2‑ to 3 cm long, was taken from each side. The right and left samples were sent separately and labeled. The incision was closed with 3‑0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular pattern and sealed with Dermabond. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
