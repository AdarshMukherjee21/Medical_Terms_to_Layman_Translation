  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Blood loss anemia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal colon with no evidence of bleeding. 2. Hiatal hernia. 3. Fundal gastritis with polyps. 4. Antral mass. ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed. SPECIMEN: Antrum and fundal polyps. HISTORY: The patient is a 66-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD Hospital with mental status changes. She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss. She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months. After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids. The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated. The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum. There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation. The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls. Air was aspirated. Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed. There was no evidence of perianal disease. No source of the anemia was identified. Attention was then taken for performing an EGD. The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx. The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed. There were no abnormalities of the esophagus. The stomach was entered and was insufflated. The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum. Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______. It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm. Several biopsies were taken. The mass was soft. The pylorus was then entered. The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined. There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding. The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed. In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation. There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps. Biopsy was also taken for CLO. A hiatal hernia was present as well. Air was aspirated. The scope was slowly withdrawn. The GE junction was unremarkable. The scope was fully withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes. We will await the biopsy reports and further recommendations will follow.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Anemia caused by blood loss.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  \n1. Colon looks normal, no bleeding found.  \n2. Hiatal hernia.  \n3. Inflammation of the stomach’s upper part (fundus) with polyps.  \n4. Mass in the lower part of the stomach (antrum).  \n\nANESTHESIA: Light sedation with Demerol and Versed.  \n\nSPECIMEN: Polyps from the antrum and fundus.  \n\nHISTORY: A 66‑year‑old African‑American woman came to ABCD Hospital because she was confused. She has been anemic and has lost more than 20 pounds in a few months, but no obvious blood loss was seen. After talking with her and her daughter, she agreed to have an upper endoscopy (EGD) and a colonoscopy to find the cause of her anemia.  \n\nPROCEDURE:  \nAfter the patient gave consent, she was taken to the endoscopy room. She lay on her left side and was given IV Demerol and Versed until she was well sedated. A digital rectal exam was done first; it showed no masses or hemorrhoids.  \n\nThe colonoscope was inserted into the rectum, and air was pumped in to expand the colon. The scope moved through the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon, and reached the cecum. No polyps, masses, diverticula, or inflammation were seen. The scope was then pulled back slowly, checking all walls, and air was removed. When the scope was back in the rectum, it was bent back (retroflexed) to look at the area around the anus; nothing abnormal was found. No source of the anemia was identified.  \n\nNext, the upper endoscopy was performed. The gastroscope was passed through the throat into the esophagus, which was normal. The stomach was entered and inflated with air. The scope moved along the stomach’s outer curve toward the antrum. Near the pylorus (the opening to the small intestine) on the front side, a mass‑like lesion with a central _______ was seen. It was unclear if this was a healing ulcer or a tumor. Several biopsies were taken. The mass felt soft. The pylorus was then entered, and the first part of the small intestine (duodenal bulb) was examined; no mass, ulcer, or bleeding was seen.  \n\nThe scope was brought back into the antrum and bent back (retroflexed). In the fundus and body of the stomach, streaks of inflammation were seen. Several small, flat polyps were found and removed with biopsy forceps. A biopsy was also taken for CLO testing. A hiatal hernia was noted. Air was removed, and the scope was withdrawn slowly. The gastroesophageal junction looked normal. The scope was fully removed.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition. She will have a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to look for any lymph node enlargement or blockage in the stomach. We will wait for the biopsy results and then decide on next steps."
