Impingement syndrome, right shoulder with acromioclavicular arthritis, bursitis, and chronic tendonitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Carpal tunnel syndrome, right hand, severe. 2. Bursitis, tendonitis, impingement, and AC arthritis, right shoulder. 3. Medial and lateral meniscal tears, posterior horn old, left knee. PROCEDURE: 1. Right shoulder arthroscopy, subacromial decompression, distal clavicle excision, bursectomy, and coracoacromial ligament resection. 2. Right carpal tunnel release. 3. Left knee arthroscopy and partial medial and lateral meniscectomy. ANESTHESIA: General with regional. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: To recovery room in awake, alert, and in stable condition. OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: A very active 50-year-old gentleman who had the above problems and workup revealed the above problems. He failed nonoperative management. We discussed the risks, benefits, and possible complications of operative and continued nonoperative management, and he gave his fully informed consent to the following procedure. OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table. After adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. All bony prominences were padded. The right shoulder was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using standard Betadine prep, entered through three standard arthroscopic portals anterolateral and posterior incising the skin with a knife using sharp and blunt trocar. Serial examination of the intraarticular portion of the shoulder showed all the structures to be normal including the biceps tendon ligaments, articular surfaces, and labrum. Subacromial space was entered. Visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back. It was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur. Rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact. Thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed. The burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out. The width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint. The patient tolerated the procedure very well. The shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris. The wound was closed with 3-0 Prolene. Sterile compressive dressing applied. The patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard Betadine prep. The attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes. Volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis. Tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures. Cautery was used for hemostasis. The never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of Celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down. The patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well. The hand was then irrigated, closed with Monocryl and Prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated. Attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars. After entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus. These were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver. There was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee. There was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with Celestone and Marcaine with epinephrine. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0 Prolene and sterile compressive dressing was applied, and then the patient was taken to the recovery room, extubated, awake, alert, and in stable condition.",

Long‑term carpal tunnel syndrome in the right hand with severe pain, numbness, and tingling.  \n3. Right shoulder problems: impingement, arthritis of the AC joint, bursitis, and chronic tendon inflammation.  \n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES  \n1. Severe carpal tunnel syndrome in the right hand.  \n2. Right shoulder bursitis, tendon inflammation, impingement, and AC joint arthritis.  \n3. Tears in both inner and outer knee cartilage on the left side.  \n\nPROCEDURE  \n1. Right shoulder arthroscopy with removal of bone spurs, part of the clavicle, and inflamed tissue.  \n2. Release of the carpal tunnel in the right hand.  \n3. Left knee arthroscopy with removal of damaged cartilage from the inner and outer meniscus.  \n\nANESTHESIA  \nGeneral anesthesia with a regional block.  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS  \nNone.  \n\nDISPOSITION  \nPatient went to the recovery room awake, alert, and stable.  \n\nOPERATIVE INDICATIONS  \nA very active 50‑year‑old man who had the problems listed above. Non‑surgical treatment did not help. We explained the risks, benefits, and possible complications of surgery and continued non‑surgical care. He gave informed consent for the surgery.  \n\nOPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. After general anesthesia, he was positioned on his left side. All pressure points were padded. The right shoulder was cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes. Three small portals were made for the arthroscope. Inside the shoulder joint, all structures looked normal. The surgeon entered the space under the acromion. Because of bleeding from inflamed bursa, the surgeon removed the inflamed tissue. The shoulder bone had a type‑3 shape, which was reshaped to a type‑1 by removing a large front spur with a burr. The rotator cuff was slightly frayed but otherwise intact. The thickened bursa and coracoacromial ligament were removed. The burr was then used to cut the lower part of the clavicle. Care was taken to keep the surrounding ligaments intact while removing the spurs and arthritic joint surface. The shoulder was washed thoroughly, drained, and the wound closed with 3‑0 Prolene sutures. A compressive dressing was applied.  \n\nThe patient was then laid back on his back. The right hand and left lower leg were cleaned with Betadine and draped. The right hand was raised, blood was removed with an Esmarch bandage, and a tourniquet was applied at 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes. A small incision was made on the palm side of the hand. The surgeon cut through the skin and used cautery to stop bleeding. The carpal ligament was exposed, cut sharply, and removed while avoiding nerves and blood vessels. Cautery was used again to stop bleeding. The surgeon noted that the nerve had a small constriction from the ligament, so a small amount of steroid (Celestone) was applied to the nerve. The hand was washed, closed with Monocryl and Prolene sutures, and a compressive dressing was applied. The tourniquet was released.  \n\nNext, the left knee was entered through two small portals on the inside and outside of the knee. Inside the knee, a displaced bucket‑handle tear of the inner meniscus and a radial tear of the outer meniscus were seen. These tears were removed back to a stable surface using a basket forceps and a shaver. No other major arthritis was seen. There was a lot of inflamed synovium, so after washing the knee, the surgeon injected steroid (Celestone) and local anesthetic (Marcaine) with epinephrine. The wounds were closed with 3‑0 Prolene sutures and a compressive dressing.  \n\nThe patient was taken to the recovery room, the breathing tube was removed, and he was awake, alert, and stable."
