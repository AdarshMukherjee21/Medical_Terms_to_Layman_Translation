  "medical": "CC: Progressive memory and cognitive decline. HX: This 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94. Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the &quot;assassin.&quot; Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a &quot;chuckle.&quot; While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing &quot;Murder She Wrote.&quot; She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was &quot;Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.&quot; One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her. MEDS: None. PMH: Unremarkable. FHX: Father and mother died in their 80's of &quot;old age.&quot; There was no history of dementing illness, stroke, HTN, DM, or other neurological disease in her family. She has 5 children who were alive and well. SHX: She attained a High School education and had been widowed for over 30 years. She lived alone for 15 years until to 12/94, when her daughters began sharing the task of caring for her. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drug use. EXAM: Vitals signs were within normal limits. MS: A&O to person place and time. At times she seemed in absence. She scored 20/30 on MMSE and had difficulty with concentration, calculation, visuospatial construction. Her penmanship was not normal, and appeared &quot;child-like&quot; according to her daughters. She had difficulty writing a sentence and spoke in a halting fashion; she appeared to have difficulty finding words. In addition, while attempting to write, she had difficulty finding the right margin of the page. CN: Right homonymous inferior quadrantanopsia bordering on a right homonymous hemianopsia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: extinguishing of RUE sensation on double simultaneous stimulation, and at times she appeared to show sign of RUE neglect. There were no unusual spontaneous movements noted. Coord: unremarkable except for difficulty finding the target on FNF exercise when the target was moved into the right side visual field. Station: No sign of Romberg or pronator drift. There was no truncal ataxia. Gait: decreased RUE swing and a tendency to veer and circumambulate to the right when asked to walk toward a target. Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all four extremities. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally. COURSE: CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, UA, CRP, TSH, FT4, and EKG were unremarkable. CSF analysis revealed: 38 RBC, 0 WBC, Protein 36, glucose 76. The outside MRI was reviewed and was found to show increased signal on T2 weighted images in the gyri of the left parietal-occipital regions. Repeat MRI, at UIHC, revealed the same plus increased signal on T2 weighted images in the left frontal region as well. CXR, transthoracic echocardiogram and 4 vessel cerebral angiogram were unremarkable. A 1/23/95, left frontal brain biopsy revealed spongiform changes without sign of focal necrosis, vasculitis or inflammatory changes. The working diagnosis became Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Heidenhaim variant). The patient died on 2/15/95. Brain tissue was sent to the University of California at San Francisco. Analysis there revealed diffuse vacuolization throughout most of the cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum and medulla. This vacuolization was most severe in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. Hydrolytic autoclaving technique was used with PrP-specific antibodies to identify the presence of protease resistant PrP (CJD). The patient's brain tissue was strongly positive for PrP (CJD).",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nThe patient, a 73‑year‑old woman, had been experiencing a gradual loss of memory and thinking ability.\n\n**History of Present Illness**  \nShe had been living with right‑heart failure and first noticed memory problems in November 1994. Her family saw the decline a week before Thanksgiving when she was in Colorado for a family gathering. She was chosen to play “Murder She Wrote,” but a toy gun hidden in her carry‑on set off the security alarm. She was searched and seemed very upset and confused. In Colorado she was slow, had trouble reading her lines, and needed help finishing the game. She did not slur her speech, had no vision problems, and did not feel weak.\n\nShe went back to work at a florist shop the Monday after Thanksgiving but could not do her usual tasks of arranging flowers or using the cash register. She quit the next day and never returned. Her mental state stayed fairly stable through November and December, when a local neurologist examined her. Blood tests (VDRL, thyroid tests, glucose, B12, folate, CBC), a chest X‑ray, and a brain MRI were all normal. The neurologist diagnosed “Alzheimer’s‑type dementia.”\n\nOne to two weeks before her visit on January 12, 1995, she began getting lost in her own home. She and her family noticed she had trouble finding words, paying attention, doing simple math, and she became unusually emotional. She also walked to the right and often did not recognize people speaking to her.\n\n**Medications**  \nNone.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \nUnremarkable.\n\n**Family History**  \nBoth parents died in their 80s from “old age.” No family history of dementia, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other neurological disease.\n\n**Social History**  \nShe finished high school, has been widowed for over 30 years, and lived alone for 15 years until December 1994 when her daughters began helping care for her. She has no history of smoking, drinking, or drug use.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- **Vitals**: Normal.  \n- **Mental Status**: Alert to person, place, and time but sometimes seemed absent. Scored 20/30 on the Mini‑Mental State Exam. Had trouble concentrating, calculating, and drawing. Handwriting was childlike; she had difficulty writing sentences and found words hard to say. She also struggled to keep her writing on the right margin.  \n- **Cranial Nerves**: She had a loss of the lower right visual field (right‑side vision loss). All other cranial nerves were normal.  \n- **Motor**: Full strength (5/5) in all limbs, normal muscle tone.  \n- **Sensory**: Loss of sensation in the right arm when tested with double simultaneous stimulation; sometimes she ignored the right arm.  \n- **Coordination**: Normal except she had trouble reaching a target with her finger when the target moved to the right side.  \n- **Balance**: No problems with standing (no Romberg) and no arm drift.  \n- **Gait**: Her right arm swung less and she tended to veer to the right when walking toward a target.  \n- **Reflexes**: Normal in all four limbs. Plantar responses were unclear.\n\n**Course and Additional Tests**  \n- Blood work (CBC, glucose, PT, PTT, ESR, urinalysis, CRP, thyroid tests, EKG) was normal.  \n- Cerebrospinal fluid: 38 red cells, no white cells, protein 36, glucose 76.  \n- MRI of the brain showed increased signal on T2 images in the left parietal‑occipital area; a repeat MRI also showed increased signal in the left frontal area.  \n- Chest X‑ray, heart echo, and a 4‑vessel brain angiogram were normal.  \n- A brain biopsy on January 23, 1995, of the left frontal lobe showed spongy changes but no necrosis, blood vessel inflammation, or other inflammation.  \n- The diagnosis was changed to Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease (Heidenhain variant).  \n- The patient died on February 15, 1995.  \n- Her brain tissue was sent to the University of California, San Francisco. Pathology showed widespread vacuoles (empty spaces) throughout many brain regions, especially severe in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. Using a special technique with prion protein antibodies, the tissue was strongly positive for the disease protein, confirming Creutzfeldt‑Jakob disease."
