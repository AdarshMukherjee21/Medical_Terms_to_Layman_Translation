  "medical": "CC: Progressive unsteadiness following head trauma. HX: A7 7 y/o male fell, as he was getting out of bed, and struck his head, 4 weeks prior to admission. He then began to experience progressive unsteadiness and gait instability for several days after the fall. He was then evaluated at a local ER and prescribed meclizine. This did not improve his symptoms, and over the past one week prior to admission began to develop left facial/LUE/LLE weakness. He was seen by a local MD on the 12/8/92 and underwent and MRI Brain scan. This showed a right subdural mass. He was then transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. PMH: 1)cardiac arrhythmia. 2)HTN. 3) excision of lip lesion 1 yr ago. SHX/FHX: Unremarkable. No h/o ETOH abuse. MEDS: Meclizine, Procardia XL. EXAM: Afebrile, BP132/74 HR72 RR16 MS: A & O x 3. Speech fluent. Comprehension, naming, repetition were intact. CN: Left lower facial weakness only. MOTOR: Left hemiparesis, 4+/5 throughout. Sensory: intact PP/TEMP/LT/PROP/VIB Coordination: ND Station: left pronator drift. Gait: left hemiparesis evident by decreased LUE swing and LLE drag. Reflexes: 2/3 in UE; 2/2 LE; Right plantar downgoing; Left plantar equivocal. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: Outside MRI revealed a loculated subdural hematoma extending throughout the frontotemporoparieto-occipital regions on the right. There was effacement of the right lateral ventricle. and a 0.5 cm leftward midline shift. He underwent a HCT on admission, 12/8/92, which showed a right subdural hematoma. He then underwent emergent evacuation of this hematoma. He was discharged home 6 days after surgery.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:**  \nThe boy has been getting more unsteady after hitting his head.\n\n**History:**  \nA 7‑year‑old boy fell while getting out of bed about a month ago and hit his head. A few days later he started feeling increasingly unsteady and had trouble walking. He went to a local emergency room and was given meclizine, but it didn’t help. In the last week before he was admitted, he developed weakness on the left side of his face, left arm, and left leg. A doctor saw him on December 8, 1992, and ordered an MRI of his brain. The scan showed a right‑side subdural mass. He was then transferred to UIHC for further care.\n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Heart rhythm problem  \n2. High blood pressure  \n3. Had a lip removed a year ago  \n\n**Social/Family history:**  \nNothing notable. No history of alcohol abuse.\n\n**Medications:**  \nMeclizine, Procardia XL\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- No fever, blood pressure 132/74, heart rate 72, breathing 16, alert and oriented.  \n- Speech is clear; understanding, naming, and repeating words are fine.  \n- Facial weakness only on the lower left side.  \n- Muscle strength: left side of body is slightly weaker (4+/5).  \n- Sensation is normal.  \n- Coordination normal.  \n- On a stand test, the left arm drifts slightly.  \n- Walking shows left‑side weakness: left arm swings less and left leg drags.  \n- Reflexes: 2/3 in arms, 2/2 in legs. Plantar reflexes normal on right, unclear on left.  \n- General exam is normal.\n\n**Course:**  \nThe MRI outside the hospital showed a loculated subdural hematoma on the right side, affecting the front, temporal, parietal, and occipital areas. It pushed the right lateral ventricle and caused a 0.5 cm shift of the brain’s midline to the left. He had a head CT on admission (December 8, 1992) that confirmed the right subdural hematoma. He had emergency surgery to remove the clot. He was discharged home six days after the operation."
