  "medical": "REASON FOR VISIT: Ms. ABC is a 67-year-old woman with adult hydrocephalus who returns to clinic for a routine evaluation. She comes to clinic by herself. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She has been followed for her hydrocephalus since 2002. She also had an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion from C3 though C5 in March 2007. She was last seen by us in clinic in March 2008 and she was experiencing little bit of head fullness and ringing in the ears at that time; however, we decided to leave her shunt setting at 1.0. We wanted her to followup with Dr. XYZ regarding the MRI of the cervical spine. Today, she tells me that with respect to her bladder last week she had some episodes of urinary frequency, however, this week she is not experiencing the same type of episodes. She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes. She does experience some leakage with coughing. She wears the pad on a daily basis. She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last. With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time. She reports no headaches at this time. With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse. In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs. She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy. She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful. She feels that she is walking slower for this reason. She does not use the cane at this time. Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces. She is able to walk up and down stairs and has no trouble getting in and out of a car. MEDICATIONS: Rhinocort 32 mg two sprays a day, Singulair 10 mg once a day, Xyzal 5 mg in the morning, Spiriva once a day, Advair twice a day, Prevacid 30 mg twice a day, Os-Cal 500 mg once a day, multivitamin once a day, and aspirin 81 mg a day. MAJOR FINDINGS: On exam today, this is a pleasant 67-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area with little difficulty. She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt. The shunt site is clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 1.0. Mental Status: Assessed and appears intact for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge. Her Mini-Mental Status exam score was 26/30 when attention was tested with calculations and 30/30 when attention was tested with spelling. Cranial Nerves: Extraocular movements are somewhat inhibited. She does not display any nystagmus at this time. Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement are all intact. Gait: Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool, which showed a balance score of 13/16 and a gait score of 11/12 for a total score of 24/28. ASSESSMENT: Ms. ABC has been experiencing difficulty with walking over the past several months. PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: 1. Hydrocephalus. 2. Cervical stenosis and retrolisthesis. 3. Neuropathy in the legs. PLAN: Before we recommend anything more, we would like to get a hold of the notes from Dr. XYZ to try to come up with a concrete plan as to what we can do next for Ms. ABC. We believe that her walking is most likely not being effected by the hydrocephalus. We would like to see her back in clinic in two and a half months or so. We also talked to her about having her obtain cane training so that she knows how to properly use her cane, which she states she does have one. I suggested that she use the cane at her on discretion.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:**  \nMs. ABC, a 67‑year‑old woman with adult hydrocephalus, came to the clinic for a routine check‑up. She came by herself.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nShe has been monitored for hydrocephalus since 2002. In March 2007 she had surgery to remove part of her neck bones (C3‑C5) and fuse them. We last saw her in March 2008 when she had a little feeling of head fullness and ringing in her ears; we kept her shunt setting at 1.0 and told her to follow up with Dr. XYZ about a cervical spine MRI.  \n\nToday she says that last week she had a few episodes of frequent urination, but this week she no longer has those episodes. She has no urgency or incontinence and feels she empties her bladder completely, though she does leak a little when she coughs. She wears a pad daily. She thinks her bladder has not changed much since we last saw her.  \n\nShe reports no problems with thinking or memory and no headaches. She says her walking and balance feel worse. In early May she had a coughing spell and then developed buttock pain that radiates down her legs. She says her legs feel “elastic” and she has tingling that can be painful. This tingling is constant at times. Because of this, she walks more slowly. She is not using a cane right now. She can usually walk over uneven ground, up and down stairs, and get in and out of a car without trouble.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Rhinocort 32 µg, 2 sprays/day  \n- Singulair 10 mg, once/day  \n- Xyzal 5 mg, morning  \n- Spiriva, once/day  \n- Advair, twice/day  \n- Prevacid 30 mg, twice/day  \n- Os‑Cal 500 mg, once/day  \n- Multivitamin, once/day  \n- Aspirin 81 mg, once/day\n\n**Major findings:**  \nOn exam she was a pleasant, well‑developed, well‑nourished 67‑year‑old woman who had little difficulty getting from the waiting area to the exam room. Her shunt site was clean, dry, and intact; the setting was 1.0.  \n\n*Mental status:* She was oriented, had good recent and remote memory, good attention, concentration, language, and general knowledge. Her Mini‑Mental Status exam was 26/30 on a calculation test and 30/30 on a spelling test.  \n\n*Neurologic exam:*  \n- Eye movements were somewhat limited; no nystagmus.  \n- Facial movements, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate were normal.  \n\n*Gait:* Using the Tinetti test, she scored 13/16 for balance and 11/12 for gait, for a total of 24/28.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMs. ABC has had difficulty walking for several months.\n\n**Problems/diagnoses:**  \n1. Hydrocephalus  \n2. Cervical stenosis and retrolisthesis  \n3. Leg neuropathy  \n\n**Plan:**  \nWe want to review Dr. XYZ’s notes before deciding on next steps. We think her walking problems are probably not caused by the hydrocephalus. We will see her again in about two and a half months. We also discussed cane training so she can use a cane properly; she has a cane but only uses it when she chooses."
