  "medical": "This is a 30-year-old female with pain and swelling, status post injury. FINDINGS: There are posttraumatic cysts along the volar midline and volar lateral aspects of the lunate which are likely posttraumatic. There is no acute marrow edema (series #12 images #5-7). Marrow signal is otherwise normal in the distal radius and ulna, throughout the carpals and throughout the proximal metacarpals. There is a partial tear of the volar component of the scapholunate ligament in the region of the posttraumatic lunate cyst with retraction and thickening towards the scaphoid (series #6 image #5, series #8 images #22-36). There is tearing of the membranous portion of the ligament. The dorsal component is intact. The lunatotriquetral ligament is thickened and lax, but intact (series #8 image #32). There is no tearing of the radial or ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage (series #6 image #7). There is a mildly positive ulnar variance. Normal ulnar collateral ligament. The patient was positioned in dorsiflexion. Carpal alignment is normal and there are no tears of the dorsal or ventral intercarpal ligaments (series #14 image #9). There is a longitudinal split tear of the ECU tendon which is enlarged both at the level of and distal to the ulnar styloid with severe synovitis (series #4 images #8-16, series #3 images #9-16). There is thickening of the extensor tendon sheaths within the fourth dorsal compartment with intrinsically normal tendons (series #4 image #12). There is extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis synovitis in the second dorsal compartment (series #4 image #13). Normal flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel. There is mild thickening of the tendon sheaths and the median nerve demonstrates increased signal without compression or enlargement (series #3 image #7, series #4 image #7). There are no pathological cysts or soft tissue masses. IMPRESSION: Partial tear of the volar and membranous components of the scapholunate ligament with an associated posttraumatic cyst in the lunate. There is thickening and laxity of the lunatotriquetral ligament. Longitudinal split tear of the ECU tendon with tendinosis and severe synovitis. Synovitis of the second dorsal compartment and tendon sheath thickening in the fourth dorsal compartment. Tendon sheath thickening within the carpal tunnel with increased signal within the median nerve.",
  "layman": "This 30‑year‑old woman has pain and swelling after an injury.  \n\n**Findings**  \n- Small fluid‑filled cysts are seen on the inside (volar) side of the middle wrist bone (lunate) and on its side. These are likely from the injury.  \n- There is no new bone swelling (no marrow edema). The bone signal in the wrist and hand is otherwise normal.  \n- The front part of the scapholunate ligament (the ligament that connects the scaphoid and lunate bones) is partially torn near the cyst. The torn part pulls back and thickens toward the scaphoid. The back part of the ligament is still intact.  \n- The lunatotriquetral ligament (between the lunate and triquetrum bones) is thickened and a bit loose but not torn.  \n- The triangular fibrocartilage (a small cartilage that helps the wrist move) is intact.  \n- The wrist bones line up normally and there are no tears in the other wrist ligaments.  \n- The extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon, which runs behind the wrist, has a long split tear. It is enlarged at the level of and below the ulnar styloid, and there is severe inflammation of the surrounding fluid (synovitis).  \n- The tendon sheaths in the fourth dorsal compartment are thickened, but the tendons themselves look normal.  \n- The extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis tendons in the second dorsal compartment also show inflammation.  \n- The flexor tendons inside the carpal tunnel are normal.  \n- The tendon sheaths in the carpal tunnel are mildly thickened, and the median nerve shows increased signal on imaging but is not compressed or enlarged.  \n- No abnormal cysts or soft‑tissue masses were found.  \n\n**Impression**  \n- Partial tear of the front and middle parts of the scapholunate ligament with a cyst in the lunate.  \n- The lunatotriquetral ligament is thickened and loose.  \n- Long split tear of the ECU tendon with tendon degeneration and severe inflammation.  \n- Inflammation in the second dorsal compartment and thickening of tendon sheaths in the fourth dorsal compartment.  \n- Thickened tendon sheaths in the carpal tunnel and increased signal in the median nerve."
