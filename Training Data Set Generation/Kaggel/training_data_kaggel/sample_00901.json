  "medical": "REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Followup of seizures. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 47-year-old African-American female, well known to the neurology service, who has been referred to me for the first time evaluation of her left temporal lobe epilepsy that was diagnosed in August of 2002. At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds. She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop. She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep. She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative. Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy. She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then. She reports no seizures in the past several years. She currently is without complaint. In terms of seizure risk factors she denies head trauma, history of CNS infection, history of CVA, childhood seizures, febrile seizures. There is no family history of seizures. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant only for hypertension and left temporal lobe epilepsy. FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable only for hypertension in her father. Her mother died in a motor vehicle accident. SOCIAL HISTORY: She works running a day care at home. She has three children. She is married. She does not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see note in chart. Only endorses weight gain and the history of seizures, as well as some minor headaches treated with over-the-counter medications. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., verapamil, and hydrochlorothiazide. ALLERGIES: Flagyl and aspirin. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure is 138/88, heart rate is 76, respiratory rate is 18, and weight is 224 pounds, pain scale is none. General Examination: Please see note in chart, which is essentially unremarkable except mild obesity. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Again, please see note in chart. Mental status is normal, cranial nerves are intact, motor is normal bulk and tone throughout with no weakness appreciated in upper and lower extremities bilaterally. There is no drift and there are no abnormalities to orbit. Sensory examination, light touch, and temperature intact at all distal extremities. Cerebellar examination, she has normal finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movements, heel-to-shin, and foot tap. She rises easily from the chair. She has normal step, stride, arm swing, toe, heel, and tandem. Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and equal at biceps, brachioradialis, patella, and 1 at the ankles. She was seen in the emergency room for chest pain one month ago. CT of the head was performed, which I reviewed, dated September 07, 2006. The findings were within the range of normal variation. There is no evidence of bleeding, mass, lesions, or any evidence of atrophy. IMPRESSION: This is a pleasant 47-year-old African-American female with what appears to be cryptogenic left temporal lobe epilepsy that is very well controlled on her current dose of lamotrigine. PLAN: 1. Continue lamotrigine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2. I discussed with the patient the option of a trial of medications. We need to repeat her EEG as well as her MRI prior to weaning her medications. The patient wants to continue her lamotrigine at this time. I concur. 3. The patient will be following up with me in six months.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:** Follow‑up after seizures.  \n\n**History of current illness:**  \nA 47‑year‑old African‑American woman who has been seen by neurology before has come to me for the first time to review her left‑temporal‑lobe epilepsy, which was diagnosed in August 2002. At that time she had one big seizure that involved shaking and stiffening. She also had several brief episodes (about 60 seconds each) of confusion and feeling unsteady that started suddenly and stopped abruptly. Two EEG tests in 2002 (August 4 and November 1) showed rare sharp waves in the left front‑temporal area when she was drowsy or sleeping. An MRI on September 5, 2002, with and without contrast was normal. Dr. X at Johns Hopkins looked at her tests and confirmed the diagnosis of left‑temporal‑lobe epilepsy. She was started on Trileptal, then switched to Keppra, which made her feel bad, and in 2003 she began lamotrigine, which she has taken since. She reports no seizures in the past several years and has no current complaints. She denies head injury, brain infection, stroke, childhood seizures, or family history of seizures.  \n\n**Past medical history:** Hypertension and left‑temporal‑lobe epilepsy.  \n\n**Family history:** Father has high blood pressure. Mother died in a car accident.  \n\n**Social history:** She runs a home day‑care and has three children. Married. Does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs.  \n\n**Review of systems:** Only weight gain, past seizures, and occasional mild headaches treated with over‑the‑counter pain relievers.  \n\n**Current medications:** Lamotrigine 150 mg twice daily, verapamil, hydrochlorothiazide.  \n\n**Allergies:** Flagyl and aspirin.  \n\n**Physical exam:** Blood pressure 138/88, heart rate 76, breathing 18 breaths/min, weight 224 lb. No pain. She is mildly obese. Neurologic exam is normal: normal mental status, cranial nerves, muscle strength, coordination, reflexes, and sensation.  \n\nShe was in the emergency room for chest pain one month ago. A head CT on September 7, 2006, was normal—no bleeding, mass, or atrophy.  \n\n**Impression:** A pleasant 47‑year‑old woman with well‑controlled cryptogenic left‑temporal‑lobe epilepsy on lamotrigine.  \n\n**Plan:**  \n1. Keep lamotrigine 150 mg twice daily.  \n2. Discussed trying other medications, but she wants to stay on lamotrigine for now. We will repeat her EEG and MRI before considering any changes.  \n3. She will return for a follow‑up in six months."
