  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above. He was seen a few weeks ago for routine followup, and he was noted for microhematuria. Due to his history of kidney stone, renal ultrasound as well as IVP was done. He presents today for followup. He denies any dysuria, gross hematuria or flank pain issues. Last stone episode was over a year ago. No history of smoking. Daytime frequency 3 to 4 and nocturia 1 to 2, good stream, empties well with no incontinence. Creatinine 1.0 on June 25, 2008, UA at that time was noted for 5-9 RBCs, renal ultrasound of 07/24/2008 revealed 6 mm left intrarenal stone, with no hydronephrosis. IVP same day revealed a calcification over the left kidney, but without bilateral hydronephrosis. The calcification previously noted on the ureter appears to be outside the course of the ureter. Otherwise unremarkable. This is discussed. IMPRESSION: 1. A 6-mm left intrarenal stone, nonobstructing, by ultrasound and IVP. The patient is asymptomatic. We have discussed surgical intervention versus observation. He indicates that this stone is not bothersome, prefers observation, need for hydration with a goal of making over 2 liters of urine within 24 hours is discussed. 2. Microhematuria, we discussed possible etiologies of this, and the patient is agreeable to cystoscopy in the near future. Urine sent for culture and sensitivity. PLAN: As above. The patient will follow up for cystoscopy, urine sent for cytology, continue hydration. Call if any concern. The patient is seen and evaluated by myself.",
  "layman": "**History of Present Illness:**  \nThe patient came today for a follow‑up from Dr. ABC’s office. He was seen a few weeks ago for a routine check and was found to have a small amount of blood in his urine (microhematuria). Because he has a history of kidney stones, a kidney ultrasound and an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) were done. He is here today for another check‑up. He says he has no pain when he urinates, no visible blood in his urine, and no flank pain. His last stone was more than a year ago. He does not smoke. He urinates 3–4 times during the day and 1–2 times at night, has a good stream, empties his bladder well, and does not leak urine.\n\nOn June 25, 2008 his creatinine was 1.0. A urine test then showed 5–9 red blood cells. An ultrasound on July 24, 2008 found a 6‑mm stone inside his left kidney, but it was not blocking the kidney (no swelling of the kidney). The IVP on the same day showed a calcification near the left kidney but no swelling of the kidneys. The calcification that had been seen in the ureter appears to be outside the ureter’s normal path. Otherwise, the studies were normal. We talked about these findings.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. A 6‑mm stone inside the left kidney that is not blocking urine flow. The patient has no symptoms. We discussed surgery versus watching it. He prefers to watch it and was told to drink enough water to produce more than 2 liters of urine in 24 hours.  \n2. Small amount of blood in the urine. We talked about possible causes and the patient agreed to have a cystoscopy soon. Urine was sent for culture and sensitivity.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Follow up with cystoscopy.  \n- Send urine for cytology.  \n- Keep drinking plenty of water.  \n- Call if anything changes.  \nThe patient was seen and evaluated by me."
