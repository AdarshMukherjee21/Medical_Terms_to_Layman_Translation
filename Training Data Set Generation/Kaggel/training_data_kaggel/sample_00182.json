  "medical": "CC: Difficulty with speech. HX: This 72 y/o RHM awoke early on 8/14/95 to prepare to play golf. He felt fine. However, at 6:00AM, on 8/14/95, he began speaking abnormally. His wife described his speech as &quot;word salad&quot; and &quot;complete gibberish.&quot; She immediately took him to a local hospital . Enroute, he was initially able to understand what was spoken to him. By the time he arrived at the hospital at 6:45AM, he was unable to follow commands. His speech was reportedly unintelligible the majority of the time, and some of the health care workers thought he was speaking a foreign language. There were no other symptoms or signs. He had no prior history of cerebrovascular disease. Blood pressure 130/70 and Pulse 82 upon admission to the local hospital on 8/14/95. Evaluation at the local hospital included: 1)HCT scan revealed an old left putaminal hypodensity, but no acute changes or evidence of hemorrhage, 2) Carotid Duplex scan showed ICA stenosis of 40%, bilaterally. He was placed on heparin and transferred to UIHC on 8/16/95. In addition, he had noted memory and word finding difficulty for 2 months prior to presentation. He had undergone a gastrectomy 16 years prior for peptic ulcer disease. His local physician found him vitamin B12 deficient and he was placed on vitamin B12 and folate supplementation 2 months prior to presentation. He and his wife felt that this resulted in improvement of his language and cognitive skills. MEDS: Heparin IV, Vitamin B12 injection q. week, Lopressor, Folate, MVI. PMH: 1)Hypothyroidism (reportedly resolved), 2) Gastrectomy, 3)Vitamin B12 deficiency. FHX: Mother died of MI, age 70. Father died of prostate cancer, age 80. Bother died of CAD and prostate cancer, age 74. SHX: Married. 3 children who are alive and well. Semi-retired Attorney. Denied h/o tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP 110/70, HR 50, RR 14, Afebrile. MS: A&O to person and place, but not time. Oral comprehension was poor beyond the simplest of conversational phrases. Speech was fluent, but consisted largely of &quot;word salad.&quot; When asked how he was, he replied: &quot;abadeedleedlebadle.&quot; Repetition was defective, especially with long phrases. On rare occasions, he uttered short comments appropriately. Speech was marred by semantic and phonemic paraphasias. He named colors and described most actions well, although he described a &quot;faucet dripping&quot; as a &quot;faucet drop.&quot; He called &quot;red&quot; &quot;reed.&quot; Reading comprehension was better than aural comprehension. He demonstrated excellent written calculations. Spoken calculations were accurate except when the calculations became more complex. For example, he said that ten percent of 100 was equal to &quot;1,200.&quot; CN: Pupils 2/3 decreasing to 1/1 on exposure to light. VFFTC. There were no field cuts or evidence of visual neglect. EOM were intact. Face moved symmetrically. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: Full strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk. There was no evidence of drift. SENSORY: unremarkable. COORD: unremarkable. Station: unremarkable. Gait: mild difficulty with TW. Reflexes: 2/2 in BUE. 2/2+ patellae, 1/1 Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor on the left and equivocal on the right. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: Lab data on admission: Glucose 97, BUN 20, Na 134, K 4.0, Cr 1.3, Chloride 98, CO2 24, PT 11, PTT 42, WBC 12.0 (normal differential), Hgb 11.4, Hct 36%, Plt=203k. UA normal. TSH 6.0, FT4 0.88, Vit B12 876, Folate 19.1. He was admitted and continued on heparin. MRI scan, 8/16/95, revealed increased signal on T2-weighted images in Wernicke's area in the left temporal region. Transthoracic echocardiogram on 8/17/95 was unremarkable. Transesophageal echocardiogram on 8/18/95 revealed a sclerotic aortic valve and myxomatous degeneration of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. LAE 4.8cm, and spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium were noted. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunt or clot. Carotid duplex scan on 8/16/95 revealed 0-15% BICA stenosis with anterograde vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Neuropsychologic testing revealed a Wernicke's aphasia. The impression was that the patient had had a cardioembolic stroke involving a lower-division branch of the left MCA. He was subsequently placed on warfarin. Thoughout his hospital stay he showed continued improvement of language skills and was enrolled in speech therapy following discharge, 8/21/95. He has had no further stroke like episodes up until his last follow-up visit in 1997.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Trouble speaking.\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nA 72‑year‑old man with a history of stomach surgery and low vitamin B12 levels woke up early on August 14, 1995, to get ready for a golf game. He felt fine at first, but by 6:00 a.m. he began speaking oddly. His wife said his words were “word salad” and “complete gibberish.” She took him to a local hospital right away. While driving, he could understand people, but when he arrived at the hospital at 6:45 a.m. he could no longer follow instructions. Most of the time his speech was unintelligible, and some nurses thought he was speaking a foreign language. He had no other symptoms. He had never had a stroke before. His blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg and his pulse 82 bpm when he was admitted.\n\nAt the local hospital, a CT scan showed an old area of low density in the left part of the brain but no new damage or bleeding. A carotid duplex scan found 40 % narrowing of the internal carotid arteries on both sides. He was started on heparin (a blood thinner) and transferred to the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics (UIHC) on August 16, 1995.  \n\nHe had been having trouble remembering things and finding the right words for about two months before this event. He had a stomach surgery 16 years earlier for a peptic ulcer. Two months before the stroke, his doctor found he was low on vitamin B12 and started him on B12 and folate supplements, which helped his language and thinking a little.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Heparin IV  \n- Vitamin B12 injection once a week  \n- Lopressor (a beta‑blocker)  \n- Folate  \n- Multivitamin\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1. Underactive thyroid (thought to be resolved)  \n2. Stomach surgery  \n3. Low vitamin B12\n\n**Family History:**  \nMother died of a heart attack at 70.  \nFather died of prostate cancer at 80.  \nBrother died of heart disease and prostate cancer at 74.\n\n**Social History:**  \nMarried, three living children, semi‑retired attorney. No tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.\n\n**Physical Examination (at UIHC):**  \n- Blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate 50 bpm, normal breathing, no fever.  \n- Alert to person and place but not to time.  \n- Could understand only very simple spoken words.  \n- Speech was fluent but mostly nonsense words (“word salad”). When asked how he was, he said “abadeedleedlebadle.” Repeating long phrases was difficult. Occasionally he said short comments correctly.  \n- He had trouble with word meaning and sound errors. He could name colors and describe most actions, but sometimes used wrong words (e.g., called a “faucet dripping” a “faucet drop,” and said “red” was “reed”). Reading was better than listening. He could do written math well, but made mistakes with more complex spoken calculations (e.g., said 10 % of 100 was 1,200).  \n- Eyes: pupils 2/3 that get smaller to 1/1 with light. Vision normal, no field loss or neglect.  \n- Eye movements normal. Face moved symmetrically. Other cranial nerves normal.  \n- Muscles: full strength, normal tone, no drift.  \n- Sensation normal.  \n- Coordination normal.  \n- Gait: mild trouble walking straight.  \n- Reflexes normal.  \n- Plantar responses: left side flexor, right side unclear.  \n- Genitals normal.\n\n**Course and Investigations:**  \n- Blood tests on admission: glucose 97, BUN 20, sodium 134, potassium 4.0, creatinine 1.3, chloride 98, CO₂ 24, PT 11, PTT 42, white cells 12.0 (normal mix), hemoglobin 11.4, hematocrit 36 %, platelets 203,000. Urine normal. TSH 6.0, free T4 0.88, vitamin B12 876, folate 19.1.  \n- He stayed on heparin.  \n- MRI on August 16, 1995 showed a bright spot on T2 images in the left temporal lobe (Wernicke’s area).  \n- Heart echo on August 17, 1995 was normal.  \n- Transesophageal echo on August 18, 1995 showed a stiff aortic valve and a floppy front part of the mitral valve. Left atrium was 4.8 cm and had swirling blood, but no clot or shunt.  \n- Carotid duplex on August 16, 1995 showed 0‑15 % narrowing of both internal carotid arteries with normal blood flow.  \n- Neuropsychology testing confirmed Wernicke’s aphasia (difficulty understanding and producing speech).  \n- The doctors thought he had a cardioembolic stroke (a clot from the heart) that blocked a small branch of the left middle cerebral artery.  \n- He was switched to warfarin (another blood thinner).  \n- Throughout his stay he got better at speaking. He started speech therapy after discharge on August 21, 1995.  \n- He has had no more stroke‑like episodes up to his last follow‑up in 1997."
