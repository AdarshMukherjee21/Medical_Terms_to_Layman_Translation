PROCEDURE: Open reduction internal fixation of the left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture (27513). OPERATIVE FINDINGS: He had intercondylar split, and then he had a medial Hoffa fracture. He also had some comminution of the medial femoral condyle which prohibited an anatomic key between the two segments of the medial condyle. IMPLANTS: We used 2.4 and 3.5 cortical screws, as well as a LISS Synthes femoral locking plate. COMPLICATIONS: None. IV FLUIDS: 2000 ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 40 mL URINE OUTPUT: 650 HISTORY: This 45-year-old male had a ground-level fall, sustaining this injury. He was admitted for definitive operative fixation. Risks and benefits were discussed, he agreed to go ahead with the procedure. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was identified in preop holding, then taken to the operating room. Once adequate anesthesia was obtained, his left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. He was given antibiotics. He placed a traction pin through his proximal tibia, and pulled weight off the end of the bed. I made a midline approach and then did the lateral parapatellar arthrotomy. We excised some of the fat pad to give us better visibility into the notch. We excised a good bit of his synovium and synovial pouch. At this time we were able to identify the fracture fragments. Again, there was an intercondylar split and then two free pieces of the medial condyle. The femur fracture was very distal through the metaphysis. At this time we thoroughly cleaned out all the clot between all the fracture fragments and cleaned the cortical margins. Next we began the reduction. There was no reduction key between the two segments of the Hoffa fracture. Therefore, we reduced the anterior portion of the medial condyle to the lateral condyle, held it with point-of-reduction clamp and K-wires, and then secured it with 2.4 mini fragment lag screws. Next, with this medial anterior piece in place, we had some contour over the notch with which we were able to reduce the posterior medial Hoffa fragment. This gave us a nice notch contour. Again, there was some comminution laterally so that the fracture between the Hoffa segments did not have a perfect key. Once we had it reduced, based on the notch reduction, we then held it with K-wires. We secured it with two 3.5 cortical screws from the lateral condyle into this posterior segment. We then secured it with 2.4 cortical screws from the anterior medial to the posterior medial segment just subchondral. Then, finally, we secured it with a 3.5 cortical screw from the anterior medial to the posterior medial piece. All screws ran between and out of the notch. With the condyle now well reduced, we reduced it to the metaphysis. We slid a 13-hole LISS plate submuscularly. We checked on AP and lateral views that showed we had good reduction of the fracture and appropriate plate placement. We placed the tip threaded guidewire through the A-hole of the plate jig and got it parallel to the joint. We then clamped the plate down to the bone. Proximally, we made a stab incision for the trocar at the 13-hole position, placed our tip threaded guidewire in the lateral aspect of the femur, checked it on lateral view, and had it in good position. With the jig in appropriate position and clamped, we then proceeded to fill the distal locking screws to get purchase into the condyles. We then placed multiple unicortical locking screws in the shaft and metaphyseal segment. Our most proximal screw was proximal to the tip of the prosthesis. At this time we took the jig off and put the final screw into the A-hole of the plate. We then took final C-arm views which showed we had a good reduction on AP and lateral views, the plate was in good position, we had full range of motion of the knee, and good reduction clinically and radiographically. We then pulse lavaged the knee with 3 liters of fluid. We closed the quad tendon and lateral retinaculum with interrupted 0 Vicryl over a Hemovac drain. Subdermal tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, skin with staples. Sterile dressing and a hinged knee brace were applied. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to Recovery in stable condition. PLAN: 1. Nonweightbearing for 3 months. 2. CPM for 0 to 90 degrees as tolerated.",
  "layman": "**PRE‑OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES)**  \nThe patient was diagnosed with a break in the lower part of the left thigh bone (distal femur) just above the knee, involving both the upper and lower sections of the bone.\n\n**POST‑OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES)**  \nThe same fracture was confirmed after surgery.\n\n**PROCEDURE**  \nThe surgeon performed an open surgery to realign and fix the broken left thigh bone using screws and a metal plate (procedure code 27513).\n\n**OPERATIVE FINDINGS**  \nDuring the operation the surgeon saw that the bone was split in the middle part (intercondylar split) and there was a separate break on the inside side of the lower part of the bone (medial Hoffa fracture). The inside part of the lower bone was also broken into several pieces, making it hard to line up the two pieces exactly.\n\n**IMPLANTS**  \nThe surgeon used screws that are 2.4 mm and 3.5 mm in size, and a special locking plate called a LISS Synthes femoral plate.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS**  \nNone.\n\n**IV FLUIDS**  \n2000 mL of intravenous fluids were given.\n\n**ANESTHESIA**  \nGeneral anesthesia with a breathing tube (endotracheal).\n\n**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**  \nAbout 40 mL.\n\n**URINE OUTPUT**  \n650 mL.\n\n**HISTORY**  \nA 45‑year‑old man fell from a low height and broke his left thigh bone. He was admitted to have the fracture fixed with surgery. The surgeon explained the risks and benefits, and the patient agreed to the operation.\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION**  \n1. **Preparation** – The patient was identified, taken to the operating room, and given general anesthesia. The left leg was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Antibiotics were given.  \n2. **Traction** – A traction pin was inserted into the upper part of the tibia (shin bone) to help keep the leg steady.  \n3. **Incision** – A midline cut was made, and a lateral parapatellar opening was created to access the knee joint. Fat pads and some of the joint lining (synovium) were removed to improve visibility.  \n4. **Cleaning** – Blood clots and debris were cleared from the fracture fragments, and the bone edges were cleaned.  \n5. **Reduction** – The surgeon aligned the broken pieces. Because there was no clear “key” to lock the two parts of the medial condyle together, the front part of the medial condyle was matched to the lateral condyle and held with a clamp and temporary wires (K‑wires). Two small lag screws (2.4 mm) were then used to secure this part.  \n6. **Fixing the posterior fragment** – With the front piece in place, the surgeon was able to align the back part of the medial condyle (posterior Hoffa fragment). Two larger screws (3.5 mm) were placed from the outer side of the bone into this back piece.  \n7. **Additional screws** – Two more 2.4 mm screws were placed from the front to the back of the medial condyle just below the joint surface, and a final 3.5 mm screw was used to lock the front and back pieces together.  \n8. **Plate placement** – A 13‑hole LISS plate was slid under the muscle and positioned along the thigh bone. X‑ray images (AP and lateral views) confirmed proper alignment and plate placement.  \n9. **Guides and screws** – A guidewire was inserted through the plate’s first hole, kept parallel to the joint, and clamped to the bone. A small incision was made for the trocar at the 13‑hole position, and a guidewire was placed on the outer side of the femur, checked on X‑ray, and positioned correctly. Locking screws were then inserted into the distal part of the bone to secure the plate into the condyles. Multiple unicortical locking screws were placed in the shaft and upper part of the bone. The most proximal screw was positioned just above the tip of the plate.  \n10. **Final checks** – The plate was removed from the jig, the final screw was placed, and final X‑ray images showed good alignment, proper plate position, full knee motion, and a solid fixation.  \n11. **Washing and closure** – The knee joint was washed with 3 L of fluid (pulse lavage). The quadriceps tendon and outer knee tissue (lateral retinaculum) were closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures over a Hemovac drain. The deeper tissue was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with staples. A sterile dressing and a hinged knee brace were applied.  \n12. **Recovery** – The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to recovery in stable condition.\n\n**PLAN**  \n1. The patient will not put weight on the leg for 3 months.  \n2. A continuous passive motion machine will be used to move the knee from 0° to 90° as tolerated."
