  "medical": "INDICATIONS: Chest pain, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus. PROCEDURE DONE: Dobutamine Myoview stress test. STRESS ECG RESULTS: The patient was stressed by dobutamine infusion at a rate of 10 mcg/kg/minute for three minutes, 20 mcg/kg/minute for three minutes, and 30 mcg/kg/minute for three additional minutes. Atropine 0.25 mg was given intravenously eight minutes into the dobutamine infusion. The resting electrocardiogram reveals a regular sinus rhythm with heart rate of 86 beats per minute, QS pattern in leads V1 and V2, and diffuse nonspecific T wave abnormality. The heart rate increased from 86 beats per minute to 155 beats per minute, which is about 90% of the maximum predicted target heart rate. The blood pressure increased from 130/80 to 160/70. A maximum of 1 mm J-junctional depression was seen with fast up sloping ST segments during dobutamine infusion. No ischemic ST segment changes were seen during dobutamine infusion or during the recovery process. MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING: Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging was carried out with 10.9 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview. Dobutamine infusion myocardial perfusion imaging and gated scan were carried out with 29.2 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview. The lung heart ratio is 0.36. Myocardial perfusion images were normal both at rest and with stress. Gated myocardial scan revealed normal regional wall motion and ejection fraction of 67%. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Stress test is negative for dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. 2. Normal left ventricular size, regional wall motion, and ejection fraction.",
  "layman": "**Indications:** The patient has chest pain, high blood pressure, and type II diabetes.\n\n**Procedure performed:** A Dobutamine Myoview stress test.\n\n**Stress ECG results:**  \nThe patient was given dobutamine at increasing doses: 10 µg/kg/min for 3 minutes, 20 µg/kg/min for 3 minutes, and 30 µg/kg/min for another 3 minutes. At 8 minutes into the infusion, 0.25 mg of atropine was injected IV.  \nAt rest, the ECG showed a normal heart rhythm at 86 beats per minute, a QS pattern in leads V1 and V2, and some non‑specific T‑wave changes.  \nDuring the test, the heart rate rose from 86 to 155 beats per minute, about 90 % of the predicted maximum. Blood pressure went from 130/80 to 160/70. The biggest change seen was a 1 mm depression in the J‑junction with steeply rising ST segments. No signs of heart muscle ischemia appeared on the ECG during the test or recovery.\n\n**Myocardial perfusion imaging:**  \nA resting scan used 10.9 mCi of Tc‑99m Myoview. A stress scan with dobutamine used 29.2 mCi of the same tracer. The lung‑heart ratio was 0.36. Images at rest and under stress were normal. The gated scan showed normal wall motion and an ejection fraction of 67 %.\n\n**Conclusions:**  \n1. The stress test did not show any dobutamine‑induced heart ischemia.  \n2. The left ventricle is normal in size, wall motion, and pumping function."
