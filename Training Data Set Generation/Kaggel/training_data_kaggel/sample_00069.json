C5-C6 arthrodesis, anterior interbody technique. 2. C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy. 3. C5-C6 anterior instrumentation with a 23-mm Mystique plate and the 13-mm screws. 4. Implantation of machine bone implant. 5. Microsurgical technique. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 45-year-old right-handed gentleman who presented with neck and right arm radicular pain. The pain has become more and more severe. It runs to the thumb and index finger of the right hand and it is accompanied by numbness. If he tilts his neck backwards, the pain shoots down the arm. If he is working with the computer, it is very difficult to use his mouse. He tried conservative measures and failed to respond, so he sought out surgery. Surgery was discussed with him in detail. A C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was recommended. He understood and wished to proceed with surgery. Thus, he was brought in same day for surgery on 07/03/2007. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: He was given Ancef 1 g intravenously for infection prophylaxis and then transported to the OR. There general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. He was positioned on the OR table with an IV bag between the scapulae. The neck was slightly extended and taped into position. A metal arch was placed across the neck and intraoperative x-ray was obtain to verify a good position for skin incision and the neck was prepped with Betadine and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A linear incision was created in the neck beginning just to the right of the midline extending out across the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The incision was extended through skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma. Hemostasis was assured with Bovie cautery. The anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified and dissection was carried medial to this down to the carotid sheath. The trachea and the esophagus were swept out of the way and dissection proceeded medial to the carotid sheath down between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle on to the anterior aspect of the spine. A Bovie cautery was used to mobilize the longus colli muscle around initially what turned out to be C6-C7 disk based on x-rays and then around the C5-C6 disk space. An intraoperative x-ray confirmed C5-C6 disk space had been localized and then the self-retained distraction system was inserted to maintain exposure. A 15-blade knife was used to incise the C5-C6 disk and remove disk material. and distraction pins were inserted into C5-C6 and distraction placed across the disk space. The operating microscope was then brought into the field and used throughout the case except for the closure. Various pituitaries, #15 blade knife, and curette were used to evacuate the disk as best as possible. Then, the Midas Rex drill was taken under the microscope and used to drill where the cartilaginous endplate driven back all the way into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. A nerve hook was swept underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and a fragment of disk was produced and was pulled up through the ligament. A Kerrison rongeur was used to open up the ligament in this opening and then to march out in the both neural foramina. A small amount of disk material was found at the right neural foramen. After a good decompression of both neural foramina was obtained and the thecal sac was exposed throughout the width of the exposure, the wound was thoroughly irrigated. A spacing mechanism was intact into the disk space and it was determined that a #7 spacer was appropriate. So, a #7 machine bone implant was taken and tapped into disk space and slightly counter sunk. The wound was thoroughly irrigated and inspected for hemostasis. A Mystique plate 23 mm in length was then inserted and anchored to the anterior aspect of C5-C6 to hold the bone into position and the wound was once again irrigated. The patient was valsalved. There was no further bleeding seen and intraoperative x-ray confirmed a good position near the bone, plate, and screws and the wound was enclosed in layers. The 3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate platysma and 3-0 Vicryl was used in inverted interrupted fashion to perform a subcuticular closure of the skin. The wound was cleaned. Mastisol was placed on the skin, and Steri-strips were used to approximate skin margins. Sterile dressing was placed on the patient's neck. He was extubated in the OR and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no complications.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:**  \nThe patient had a herniated disc between the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae (C5‑C6) that was pressing on a nerve, causing pain and numbness in his right arm.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:**  \nSame as pre‑operative: C5‑C6 disc herniation with right arm radiculopathy.\n\n**Procedure performed:**  \n1. Fusion of the C5‑C6 vertebrae using an anterior (front‑of‑neck) approach.  \n2. Removal of the damaged disc at C5‑C6.  \n3. Placement of a 23‑mm Mystique plate and 13‑mm screws to hold the vertebrae together.  \n4. Insertion of a machine‑made bone graft to help the bones grow together.  \n5. The surgery was done with a microscope for better visibility.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia delivered through a breathing tube (endotracheal).\n\n**Estimated blood loss:**  \nLess than 100 milliliters.\n\n---\n\n### Background and reason for surgery\n\nThe patient is a 45‑year‑old right‑handed man who has had worsening neck pain that radiates into his right arm. The pain travels to his thumb and index finger and is accompanied by numbness. When he tilts his neck backward, the pain shoots down the arm. He also has trouble using his computer mouse. He tried non‑surgical treatments (medication, rest, physical therapy) but they did not help, so he decided to have surgery. He was fully informed about the risks and benefits and agreed to proceed. The operation was scheduled for July 3, 2007.\n\n---\n\n### Surgical description\n\n1. **Preparation**  \n   - The patient received 1 gram of the antibiotic Ancef IV to prevent infection.  \n   - He was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia.  \n   - He lay on the table with an IV bag placed between his shoulder blades.  \n   - The neck was slightly extended and taped in place.  \n   - A metal arch was put over the neck and an X‑ray was taken to confirm the correct spot for the incision.  \n   - The neck area was cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes.\n\n2. **Incision and exposure**  \n   - A straight cut was made just to the right of the midline, extending across the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  \n   - The skin, fat, and platysma muscle were cut through.  \n   - Bleeding was controlled with a cautery device.  \n   - The front part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified, and the surgeon worked around it to reach the carotid sheath.  \n   - The trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (food pipe) were moved aside.  \n   - The surgeon dissected between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle to reach the front of the spine.\n\n3. **Finding the right disc space**  \n   - Using the X‑ray, the surgeon confirmed the C5‑C6 disc space.  \n   - A self‑retained distraction system was inserted to keep the space open.\n\n4. **Removing the disc**  \n   - A 15‑blade knife was used to cut the C5‑C6 disc and remove the herniated material.  \n   - Distraction pins were placed in C5 and C6 to keep the space open.  \n   - The microscope was brought in and used for the rest of the case (except for closing).  \n   - Various tools (pituitaries, curette) were used to clear the disc as much as possible.  \n   - A drill (Midas Rex) was used under the microscope to remove the cartilage from the back of the vertebral bodies.  \n   - A nerve hook was used to pull a disc fragment through the posterior longitudinal ligament.  \n   - A Kerrison rongeur opened the ligament and removed the fragment from both neural foramina (the openings where nerves exit).  \n   - A small amount of disc material was found in the right foramen and removed.\n\n5. **Preparing the space for the graft**  \n   - After the foramina were fully cleared and the thecal sac (the protective covering of the spinal cord) was exposed, the wound was washed thoroughly.  \n   - A spacer device was placed in the disc space to keep it open.  \n   - A #7 machine bone implant was tapped into the space and slightly pressed into place.\n\n6. **Fusion hardware**  \n   - The 23‑mm Mystique plate was positioned over the front of C5‑C6 and secured with screws.  \n   - The wound was washed again and checked for bleeding.  \n   - The patient performed a Valsalva maneuver (a forced exhalation) to help check for bleeding.  \n   - An X‑ray confirmed the plate, screws, and bone graft were correctly positioned.  \n   - The wound was closed in layers:  \n     - The platysma muscle was stitched with 3‑0 Vicryl.  \n     - The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch using 3‑0 Vicryl.  \n   - The skin was cleaned, a protective ointment (Mastisol) was applied, and Steri‑strips were used to hold the skin edges together.  \n   - A sterile dressing was placed on the neck.\n\n7. **Recovery**  \n   - The breathing tube was removed in the operating room.  \n   - The patient was moved to the recovery room in stable condition.  \n   - No complications occurred during or after the surgery.\n\n---"
