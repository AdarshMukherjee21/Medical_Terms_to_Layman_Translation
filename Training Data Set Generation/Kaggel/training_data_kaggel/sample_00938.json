  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Symptomatic disk herniation, C7-T1. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Symptomatic disk herniation, C7-T1. PROCEDURES PERFORMED 1. Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression of spinal cord C7-T1. 2. Anterior cervical fusion, C7-T1. 3. Anterior cervical instrumentation, anterior C7-T1. 4. Insertion of intervertebral device, C7-T1. 5. Use of operating microscope. ANESTHESIOLOGY: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: A 30 mL. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room where he was orally intubated by The Anesthesiology Service. He was placed in the supine position on an OR table. His arms were carefully taped down. He was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A 4-cm incision was made obliquely over the left side of his neck. Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the platysma. The platysma was incised using electrocautery. Blunt dissection was done to create a plane between the strap muscles and the sternoclavicular mastoid muscle. This allowed us to get right down on to the anterior cervical spine. Blunt dissection was done to sweep off the longus colli. We isolated the C7-T1 interspace. An x-ray was taken to verify; we were indeed at the C7-T1 interspace. Shadow-Line retractor was placed as well as Caspar pins. This provided very, very good access to the C7-T1 disk. At this point, the operating microscope was brought into the decompression. A thorough and aggressive C7-T1 discectomy was done using a succession of curettes, pituitary rongeur, 4-mm cutting bur and a #2 Kerrison rongeur. At the end of the discectomy, the cartilaginous endplates were carefully removed using 4-mm cutting burr. The posterior longitudinal ligament was carefully resected using #2 Kerrison rongeur. Left-sided C8 foraminotomy was accomplished using nerve hook and a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur. At the end of the decompression, there was no further compression on the left C8 nerve root. A Synthes cortical cancellous ____________ bone was placed in the interspace. Sofamor Danek Atlantis plate was then placed over the interspace and four screws were placed, two in the body of C7 and two in the body of T1. An x-ray was taken. It showed good placement of the plate and screws. A deep drain was placed. The platysma layer was closed in running fashion using #1 Vicryl. Subcutaneous tissue was closed in an interrupted fashion using 2-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed in a running fashion using 4-0 Monocryl. Steri-Strips and dressings were applied. All counts were correct. There were no complications.",

The surgeon removed the herniated disc and relieved pressure on the spinal cord at C7‑T1.  \n2. The surgeon joined the C7 and T1 vertebrae together (fusion).  \n3. The surgeon added metal hardware to hold the fusion in place.  \n4. A special device was put between the two vertebrae.  \n5. A surgical microscope was used for better visibility.\n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia with a breathing tube.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:** About 30 mL.\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and a breathing tube was inserted by the anesthesia team. He was laid flat on the operating table and his arms were taped down. The neck area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A 4‑centimeter cut was made on the left side of the neck. The surgeon cut through the skin and the thin muscle (platysma) with an electric cautery device. He then gently separated the strap muscles from the sternocleidomastoid muscle to reach the front of the cervical spine. The longus colli muscle was moved aside. The surgeon identified the space between the C7 and T1 vertebrae and confirmed the location with an X‑ray. A retractor and pins were placed to keep the area open.\n\nThe microscope was used while the surgeon removed the herniated disc using curettes, a pituitary rongeur, a 4‑mm cutting bur, and a #2 Kerrison rongeur. The cartilage on the ends of the vertebrae was carefully removed with the 4‑mm bur, and the posterior longitudinal ligament was cut with the #2 rongeur. A small opening (foraminotomy) was made on the left side of the C8 nerve root with a nerve hook and a 2‑mm rongeur, relieving any pressure on that nerve.\n\nA piece of bone (cortical cancellous bone) was placed in the disc space. A Sofamor Danek Atlantis plate was then positioned over the space and four screws were inserted—two into C7 and two into T1—to secure the fusion. An X‑ray confirmed proper placement. A drain was inserted to remove fluid after surgery. The platysma muscle was closed with a running stitch using #1 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with interrupted stitches using 2‑0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running stitch using 4‑0 Monocryl. Steri‑Strips and dressings were applied. All surgical counts were correct and no complications occurred."
