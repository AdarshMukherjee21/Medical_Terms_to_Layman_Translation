  "medical": "CC: Episodic monocular blindness, OS. HX: This 29 y/o RHF was in her usual healthy state until 2 months prior to her 3/11/96 presentation when she developed episodic arthralgias of her knees and ankles, bilaterally. On 3/3/96, she experienced sudden onset monocular blindness, OS, lasting 5-10 minutes in duration. Her vision &quot;greyed out&quot; from the periphery to center of her visual field, OS; and during some episodes progressed to complete blindness (not even light perception). This resolved within a few minutes. She had multiple episodes of vision loss, OS, every day until 3/7/96 when she was placed on heparin for suspected LICA dissection. She saw a local ophthalmologist on 3/4/96 and was told she had a normal funduscopic exam. She experienced 0-1 spell of blindness (OS) per day from 3/7/96 to 3/11/96. In addition, she complained of difficulty with memory since 3/7/96. She denied dysarthria, aphasia or confusion, but had occasional posterior neck and bioccipital-bitemporal headaches. She had no history of deep venous or arterial thrombosis. 3/4/96, ESR=123. HCT with and without contrast on 3/7/96 and 3/11/96, and Carotid Duplex scan were &quot;unremarkable.&quot; Rheumatoid factor=normal. 3-vessel cerebral angiogram (done locally) was reportedly &quot;unremarkable.&quot; She was thought to have temporal arteritis and underwent Temporal Artery biopsy (which was unremarkable), She received Prednisone 80 mg qd for 2 days prior to presentation. On admission she complained of a left temporal headache at the biopsy site, but no loss of vision or weakness She had been experiencing mild fevers and chills for several weeks prior to presentation. Furthermore, she had developed cyanosis of the distal #3 toes on feet, and numbness and rash on the lateral aspect of her left foot. She developed a malar rash on her face 1-2 weeks prior to presentation. MEDS: Depo-Provera, Prednisone 80mg qd, and Heparin IV. PMH: 1)Headaches for 3-4 years, 2)Heart murmur, 3) cryosurgery of cervix, 4)tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, 5) elective abortion. She had no history of spontaneous miscarriage and had used oral birth control pill for 10 years prior to presentation. FHX: Migraine headaches on maternal side, including her mother. No family history of thrombosis. SHX: works as a metal grinder and was engaged to be married. She denied any tobacco or illicit drug use. She consumed 1 alcoholic drink per month. EXAM: BP147/74, HR103, RR14, 37.5C. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was fluent without dysarthria. Repetition, naming and comprehension were intact. 2/3 recall at 2 minutes. CN: unremarkable. Motor: unremarkable. Coord: unremarkable. Sensory: decreased LT, PP, TEMP, along the lateral aspect of the left foot. Gait: narrow-based and able to TT, HW and TW without difficulty. Station: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Skin: Cyanosis of the distal #3 toes on both feet. There was a reticular rash about the lateral aspect of her left foot. There were splinter-type hemorrhages under the fingernails of both hands. COURSE: ESR=108 (elevated), Hgb 11.3, Hct 33%, WBC 10.0, Plt 148k, MCV 92 (low) Cr 1.3, BUN 26, CXR and EKG were unremarkable. PTT 42 (elevated). PT normal. The rest of the GS and CBC were normal. Dilute Russell Viper venom time was elevated at 27 and a 1:1 prothrombin time mix corrected to only 36. She was admitted to the Neurology service. Blood cultures were drawn and were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography on 3/12/96 was unremarkable. Her symptoms and elevated PTT suggested an ischemic syndrome involving anticardiolipin antibody and/or lupus anticoagulant. Her signs of rash and cyanosis suggested SLE. ANA was positive at 1:640 (speckled), RF (negative), dsDNA, 443 (elevated). Serum cryoglobulins were positive at 1% (fractionation data lost). Serum RPR was positive, but FTA-ABS was negative (thereby confirming a false-positive RPR). Anticardiolipin antibodies IgM and IgG were positive at 56.1 and 56.3 respectively. Myeloperoxidase antibody was negative, ANCA was negative and hepatitis screen unremarkable. The Dermatology Service felt the patient's reticular foot rash was livedo reticularis. Rheumatology felt the patient met criteria for SLE. Hematology felt the patient met criteria for Anticardiolipin Antibody and/or Lupus anticoagulant Syndrome. Neurology felt the episodic blindness was secondary to thromboembolic events. Serum Iron studies revealed: FeSat 6, Serum Fe 15, TIBC 237, Reticulocyte count 108.5. The patient was placed on FeSO4 225mg tid. She was continued on heparin IV, but despite this she continued to have occasional episodes of left monocular blindness or &quot;gray outs&quot; up to 5 times per day. She was seen by the Neuro-ophthalmology Service. The did not think she had evidence of vasculitis in her eye. They recommended treatment with ASA 325mg bid. She was placed on this 3/15/96 and tapered off heparin. She continued to have 0-4 episodes of monocular blindness (OS) for 5-10 seconds per episodes. She was discharged home. She returned 3/29/96 for episodic diplopia lasting 5-10 minutes per episode. The episodes began on 3/27/96. During the episodes her left eye deviated laterally while the right eye remained in primary gaze. She had no prior history of diplopia or strabismus. Hgb 10.1, Hct 30%, WBC 5.2, MCV 89 (low), Plt 234k. ESR 113mm/hr. PT 12, PTT 45 (high). HCT normal. MRI brain, 3/30/96, revealed a area of increased signal on T2 weighted images in the right frontal lobe white matter. This was felt to represent a thromboembolic event. She was place on heparin IV and treated with Solu-Medrol 125mg IV q12 hours. ASA was discontinued. Hematology, Rheumatology and Neurology agreed to place her on Warfarin. She was placed on Prednisone 60mg qd following the Solu-Medrol. She continued to have transient diplopia and mild vertigo despite INR's of 2.0-2.2. ASA 81mg qd was added to her regimen. In addition, Rheumatology recommended Plaquenil 200mg bid. The neurologic symptoms decreased gradually over the ensuing 3 days. Warfarin was increased to achieve INR 2.5-3.5. She reported no residual symptoms or new neurologic events on her 5/3/96 Neurology Clinic follow-up visit. She continues to be event free on Warfarin according to her Hematology Clinic notes up to 12/96.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:**  \nThe patient had sudden, brief episodes of blindness in her left eye.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nA 29‑year‑old woman who had been healthy until about two months before March 11, 1996. She first noticed pain in both knees and ankles. On March 3, 1996 she suddenly lost vision in her left eye for 5–10 minutes. Her vision “grew dark” from the edges to the center and sometimes went completely dark (no light). The loss stopped after a few minutes. She had many similar episodes every day until March 7, 1996, when doctors started her on heparin because they suspected a blood clot in a carotid artery. An eye doctor on March 4, 1996 said her eye exam was normal. From March 7 to March 11, 1996 she had 0–1 episode per day. She also reported memory problems starting March 7, 1996, and occasional headaches behind her neck and on both sides of her head. She had no history of blood clots.  \n\nOn March 4, 1996 her ESR (a blood test that shows inflammation) was 123. CT scans of her head with and without contrast on March 7 and March 11, and a carotid duplex scan were all normal. Rheumatoid factor was normal. A 3‑vessel brain angiogram done locally was normal. She was thought to have temporal arteritis and had a temporal artery biopsy, which was normal. She had taken prednisone 80 mg daily for two days before she came to the hospital. On admission she had a left‑temporal headache at the biopsy site but no vision loss or weakness. She had mild fevers and chills for several weeks before coming in. She also noticed bluish discoloration of the tips of her third toes on both feet, numbness and a rash on the outer side of her left foot, and a rash across her cheek (malar rash) 1–2 weeks before she was admitted.  \n\n**Medications at presentation:**  \nDepo‑Provera, prednisone 80 mg daily, and heparin IV.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \nHeadaches for 3–4 years, heart murmur, cervical cryosurgery, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, elective abortion. No spontaneous miscarriages. She had used oral birth‑control pills for 10 years.  \n\n**Family history:**  \nMigraine headaches in her mother’s side of the family. No family history of blood clots.  \n\n**Social history:**  \nWorks as a metal grinder, engaged to be married. No tobacco or drug use. Drinks one alcoholic drink per month.  \n\n**Physical exam on admission:**  \nBlood pressure 147/74 mm Hg, heart rate 103, respiratory rate 14, temperature 37.5 °C.  \nAlert and oriented. Speech fluent. Memory slightly impaired (2/3 recall at 2 minutes).  \nNo eye movement problems. Normal muscle strength and coordination.  \nDecreased sensation (light touch, pain, temperature) on the outer side of her left foot.  \nWalked with a narrow base but could walk, heel‑to‑toe, and turn without difficulty.  \nNormal reflexes. Plantar responses normal.  \nSkin: bluish discoloration of the tips of the third toes on both feet; a net‑like rash on the outer left foot; small bleeding under fingernails on both hands.  \n\n**Course and investigations:**  \nESR 108 (high). Hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, hematocrit 33 %, white cells 10.0 k/µL, platelets 148 k/µL, MCV 92 fL (low), creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, BUN 26 mg/dL. Chest X‑ray and ECG normal.  \nPTT 42 s (high), PT normal. Dilute Russell viper venom time 27 s (high). A 1:1 prothrombin time mix corrected only to 36 %.  \nAdmitted to neurology. Blood cultures negative. Echocardiograms (transthoracic and transesophageal) on March 12, 1996 were normal.  \n\nThe pattern of symptoms and the high PTT suggested an “anticardiolipin antibody” or “lupus anticoagulant” syndrome, which can cause blood clots. The rash and bluish toes suggested systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  \n\nAdditional tests:  \nANA positive 1:640 (speckled), RF negative, dsDNA 443 U (high), serum cryoglobulins 1 % (positive), RPR positive but FTA‑ABS negative (false‑positive RPR). Anticardiolipin IgM and IgG both 56 units. Myeloperoxidase antibody, ANCA, hepatitis screen all normal.  \n\nDermatology said the foot rash was livedo reticularis. Rheumatology confirmed SLE. Hematology confirmed anticardiolipin/lupus anticoagulant syndrome. Neurology said the brief blindness was due to small blood clots.  \n\nIron studies: ferritin 6 ng/mL, serum iron 15 µg/dL, TIBC 237 µg/dL, reticulocyte count 108.5 k/µL. She was started on iron sulfate 225 mg three times a day.  \n\nShe continued to have brief episodes of left‑eye blindness (gray‑outs) up to five times a day while on heparin. Neuro‑ophthalmology did not find eye inflammation and recommended aspirin 325 mg twice daily. She started aspirin on March 15, 1996 and stopped heparin. She still had 0–4 brief episodes of left‑eye blindness lasting 5–10 seconds.  \n\n**Follow‑up:**  \nShe returned on March 29, 1996 with brief double vision lasting 5–10 minutes per episode, starting March 27. During episodes her left eye turned outward while the right eye stayed straight. No prior double vision or eye misalignment.  \n\nLabs: hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit 30 %, white cells 5.2 k/µL, MCV 89 fL, platelets 234 k/µL, ESR 113 mm/hr, PT 12 s, PTT 45 s (high).  \n\nMRI brain on March 30, 1996 showed a small bright spot on T2 images in the right frontal white matter, interpreted as a small clot. She was put back on heparin IV and received Solu‑Medrol 125 mg IV every 12 hours. Aspirin was stopped. Hematology, rheumatology and neurology decided to start warfarin. Prednisone 60 mg daily was added after the Solu‑Medrol. She still had brief double vision and mild dizziness even though her INR was 2.0–2.2. Aspirin 81 mg daily was added. Rheumatology also started hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) 200 mg twice daily.  \n\nHer neurological symptoms improved over the next three days. Warfarin dose was increased to keep INR 2.5–3.5. At a neurology clinic visit on May 3, 1996 she had no remaining symptoms or new neurological problems. She remained free of events on warfarin according to hematology notes up to December 1996."
