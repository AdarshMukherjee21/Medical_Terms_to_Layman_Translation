  "medical": "EXAM: Transvaginal ultrasound. HISTORY: Pelvic pain. FINDINGS: The right ovary measures 1.6 x 3.4 x 2.0 cm. There are several simple-appearing probable follicular cysts. There is no abnormal flow to suggest torsion on the right. Left ovary is enlarged, demonstrating a 6.0 x 3.5 x 3.7 cm complex cystic mass of uncertain etiology. This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst versus abscess. There is no evidence for left ovarian torsion. There is a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac likely physiologic. The uterus measures 7.7 x 5.0 cm. The endometrial echo is normal at 6 mm. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for torsion. 2. Large, complex cystic left ovarian mass as described. This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst; however, an abscess/neoplasm cannot be excluded. Recommend either short interval followup versus laparoscopic evaluation given the large size and complex nature.",

There is no abnormal blood flow that would suggest the ovary has twisted.  \nThe left ovary is larger, measuring 6.0 × 3.5 × 3.7 cm, and contains a complex cystic mass. Its cause is unclear – it could be a large bleeding cyst or an abscess. There is no sign that the left ovary has twisted.  \nA small amount of fluid is present in the space behind the uterus; this is probably normal.  \nThe uterus is 7.7 × 5.0 cm, and the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is normal at 6 mm.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. No evidence of ovarian torsion.  \n2. A large, complex cystic mass on the left ovary that could be a bleeding cyst, but an abscess or tumor cannot be ruled out.  \nRecommendation: Follow up soon or consider a laparoscopic procedure because of the size and complexity of the mass."
