PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Anterior exposure diskectomy and fusion at L4-L5 and L5-S1. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Patient was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Left lower quadrant incision was performed and taken down to the preperitoneal space with the use of the Bovie, and then preperitoneal space was opened. The iliac veins were carefully mobilized medially, and then the L4-L5 disk space was confirmed by fluoroscopy, and diskectomy fusion, which will be separately dictated by Dr. X, was performed after the adequate exposure was gained, and then after this L4-L5 disk space was fused and the L5-S1 disk space was carefully identified between the iliac vessels and the presacral veins and vessels were ligated with clips, disk was carefully exposed. Diskectomy and fusion, which will be separately dictated by Dr. X, were performed. Once this was completed, all hemostasis was confirmed. The preperitoneal space was reduced. X-ray confirmed adequate positioning and fusion. Then the fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl sutures, and then the skin was closed in 2 layers, the first layer being 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous tissues and then a 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitch, then dressed with Steri-Strips and 4 x 4's. Then patient was placed in the prone position after vascular checks of the lower extremity confirmed patency of the arteries with warm bilateral lower extremities.",

A cut was made in the left lower abdomen and taken down to the space just outside the peritoneum using a cautery device, then that space was opened. The iliac veins were gently moved to the middle, and the L4‑L5 disc space was located with a fluoroscope. After enough exposure, the disc was removed and the space was fused (details recorded separately by Dr. X). After fusing L4‑L5, the L5‑S1 disc space was found between the iliac vessels and presacral veins; those veins were tied off with clips and the disc was exposed. The disc removal and fusion were performed (details recorded separately by Dr. X). When finished, bleeding was stopped. The space was closed. An X‑ray confirmed proper placement and fusion. The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl stitches, and the skin was closed in two layers: first a 2‑0 Vicryl stitch in the subcutaneous tissue, then a 4‑0 Monocryl stitch under the skin. The wound was dressed with Steri‑Strips and four 4 × 4 dressings. The patient was then turned to lie on their stomach after checking that the leg arteries were open and the legs were warm."
