  "medical": "CARDIOLITE TREADMILL EXERCISE STRESS TEST CLINICAL DATA: This is a 72-year-old female with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and right bundle branch block. PROCEDURE: The patient was exercised on the treadmill to maximum tolerance achieving after 5 minutes a peak heart rate of 137 beats per minute with a workload of 2.3 METS. There was a normal blood pressure response. The patient did not complain of any symptoms during the test and other than the right bundle branch block that was present at rest, no other significant electrographic abnormalities were observed. Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed at rest following the injection of 10 mCi Tc-99 Cardiolite. At peak pharmacological effect, the patient was injected with 30 mCi Tc-99 Cardiolite. Gating poststress tomographic imaging was performed 30 minutes after the stress. FINDINGS: 1. The overall quality of the study is fair. 2. The left ventricular cavity appears to be normal on the rest and stress studies. 3. SPECT images demonstrate fairly homogeneous tracer distribution throughout the myocardium with no overt evidences of fixed and/or reperfusion defect. 4. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal and estimated to be 78%. IMPRESSION: Myocardial perfusion imaging is normal. Result of this test suggests low probability for significant coronary artery disease.",
  "layman": "CARDIOLITE TREADMILL EXERCISE STRESS TEST CLINICAL DATA:  \nA 72‑year‑old woman with diabetes, high blood pressure, and a right bundle branch block.  \n\nPROCEDURE:  \nShe ran on a treadmill until she could no longer continue. After 5 minutes she reached a peak heart rate of 137 beats per minute while working at 2.3 METS. Her blood pressure rose normally. She had no symptoms during the test. Apart from the right bundle branch block that was already present at rest, her heart rhythm looked normal.  \n\nAfter the treadmill test, a heart scan was done at rest using 10 mCi of Tc‑99 Cardiolite. When the medication was at its strongest, she was given 30 mCi of the same tracer. A special imaging scan was taken 30 minutes after the stress.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n1. The overall quality of the study is fair.  \n2. The left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the heart) looks normal on both the rest and stress scans.  \n3. The images show the tracer spread evenly throughout the heart muscle, with no clear areas of permanent or temporary damage.  \n4. The left ventricle’s pumping ability (ejection fraction) is normal, about 78%.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \nThe heart scan is normal. The results suggest a low chance of significant coronary artery disease."
