TITLE OF OPERATION: Cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation of the prostate. FINDINGS: After measurement of the prostate, we decided to place 5 rows of needles--row #1 had 3 needles, row #2 at the level of the mid-prostate had 4 needles, row #3 had 2 needles in the right lateral peripheral zone, row #4 was a single needle directly the urethra, and in row #5 were 2 needles placed in the left lateral peripheral zone. Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing. OPERATION IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position. Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure. After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder. Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum. An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured. Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement. Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate. Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra. Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed. The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted. After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior. The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself. Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature. The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.",

After general anesthesia, they were positioned for the procedure. The bowels had been cleaned beforehand.  \n\nA flexible cystoscope was used to look inside the bladder, and a Foley catheter was inserted through the urethra into the bladder. An ultrasound probe was placed in a stabilizer and inserted into the rectum to get a clear image of the whole prostate, which was measured again.  \n\nA template was placed over the perineum and used on the ultrasound screen to guide needle placement. Seventeen‑gauge needles were inserted one after another from the front to the back of the prostate. Ultrasound confirmed that about 14–15 needles were correctly positioned and evenly spaced, allowing the entire gland to be frozen while protecting the urethra.  \n\nA second cystoscopy showed one needle had passed through the urethra; because it was in a high front position, it was removed. A urethral warmer was then inserted through the urethra into the bladder and turned on.  \n\nThe prostate was frozen to –150 °C for 10 minutes, starting from the front and moving to the back. The ice ball was watched to make sure it reached the outer layer of the prostate and approached the rectum but did not break through the rectal wall. The tissue was then warmed actively, refrozen, and finally allowed to return to room temperature. The urethral warmer stayed on after the needles were taken out.  \n\nThe patient left the operating room stable and tolerated the procedure well."
