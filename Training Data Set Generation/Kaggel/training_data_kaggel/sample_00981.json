  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left undescended testis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left undescended testis plus left inguinal hernia. PROCEDURES: Left inguinal hernia repair, left orchiopexy with 0.25% Marcaine, ilioinguinal nerve block and wound block at 0.5% Marcaine plain. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: A high left undescended testis with a type III epididymal attachment along with vas. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 1100 mL of crystalloid. TUBES/DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. COUNTS: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2. SPECIMENS: No tissues sent to Pathology. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is an 11-1/2-year-old boy with an undescended testis on the left. The plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped. A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue. We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring. We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered. We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia. The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors. The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal. We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors. Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture. We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length. We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off. We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum. The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch. The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation. We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well. We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure. The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on the both incisions, and IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑op diagnosis:** The boy’s left testicle had not moved down into the scrotum.  \n**Post‑op diagnosis:** Left testicle still not in the scrotum and a left groin hernia.  \n\n**What was done:**  \n- Repair of the left groin hernia.  \n- Surgery to move the left testicle into the scrotum (orchiopexy).  \n- Local pain relief with 0.25% Marcaine and a nerve block with 0.5% Marcaine.  \n\n**Findings during surgery:**  \n- The left testicle was high up and attached to the epididymis and vas.  \n\n**Blood loss:** Less than 5 mL.  \n**Fluids given:** 1100 mL of crystalloid solution.  \n**Tubes or drains:** None used.  \n**Counts:** All sponges and needles were accounted for.  \n**Tissue sent to pathology:** None.  \n**Anesthesia:** General inhaled anesthetic.  \n\n**Why the surgery was needed:**  \nAn 11‑½‑year‑old boy had a left testicle that had not descended. The plan was to fix this.  \n\n**How the surgery went:**  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room, checked for correct identity and surgical site, and put under general anesthesia. He was laid on his back and the area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nA curved knife was used to make a small, curved cut in the left scrotum. The surgeon lifted the scrotal tissue and found the covering of the testicle (tunica vaginalis). They followed this up to the outer ring of the groin but could not bring the testicle out.  \n\nNext, a small cut was made in the left groin. The surgeon went through the layers of tissue until the outer ring of the groin was reached. The testicle was still not visible, so the surgeon pulled the sac that surrounds the testicle from the scrotum into the groin incision. The outer layer of the groin was cut open. The testicle was found high in the upper part of the canal.  \n\nThe surgeon removed the structures that hold the testicle in place (gubernacular structures) and opened the sac. The sac was found to be connected to a hernia and fluid-filled (hydrocele). The sac was cut away and tied off with a 0‑Vicryl suture.  \n\nThe surgeon then cut away the outer covering of the spermatic cord (lateral spermatic fascia) and used blunt tools to reach deeper into the abdominal space to get more length of the cord. The sac was also cut from the inside of the abdomen. After this, enough cord length was available to move the testicle into the middle‑low part of the scrotum.  \n\nThe testicle had a type III attachment to the epididymis and a long vas. It was placed into the scrotum in the correct direction and secured with a 4‑0 chromic stay stitch. The upper part of the scrotal pouch was closed with a 4‑0 chromic purse‑string suture.  \n\nLocal anesthetic was injected, and a nerve block was performed. The outer groin layer was closed with a running 0‑Vicryl stitch, making sure the nerve and cord were not damaged. The outer skin layer (Scarpa fascia) was closed with a 4‑0 chromic stitch, and the skin was closed with a 4‑0 Rapide subcuticular stitch. Dermabond adhesive was applied to both incisions. An IV dose of Toradol was given at the end.  \n\nThe boy tolerated the surgery well and was stable when moved to the recovery room."
