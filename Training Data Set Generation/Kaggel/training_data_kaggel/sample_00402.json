PATHOLOGY: Prostate biopsy: Right lobe, negative. Left lobe, small focus of adenocarcinoma, Gleason's 3 + 3 in approximately 5% of the tissue. Radical prostatectomy: Negative lymph nodes. Prostate gland showing moderately differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3 + 2 extending to the apex involving both lobes of the prostate, mainly right. Tumor overall involved less than 5% of the tissue. Surgical margin was reported and involved at the apex. The capsule and seminal vesicles were free.

His PSA level was 4.0, but all other parts of the exam were normal.  \n\nPROCEDURES  \nA sextant biopsy of the prostate was performed.  \nHe then had a radical prostatectomy, during which the entire prostate (including its capsule), pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and a small piece of the bladder neck were removed.  \n\nPATHOLOGY  \nBiopsy: The right lobe was clear of cancer. The left lobe had a small area of adenocarcinoma, with a Gleason score of 3 + 3, involving about 5 % of the tissue.  \n\nProstatectomy specimen: No cancer was found in the lymph nodes. The prostate gland contained moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 3 + 2. The tumor reached the apex and involved both lobes, mainly the right side. Overall, less than 5 % of the prostate tissue was cancerous. The surgical margin at the apex was involved, but the capsule and seminal vesicles were free of cancer.  \n\nDISCHARGE NOTE  \nThe patient is recovering well after surgery, with only mild urgency incontinence. His PSA after surgery is 0.1 mg/ml."
