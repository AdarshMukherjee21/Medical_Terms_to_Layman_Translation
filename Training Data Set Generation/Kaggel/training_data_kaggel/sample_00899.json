  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Austin/akin bunionectomy, right foot. HISTORY: This 77-year-old African-American female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states she has had a bunion deformity for as long as she can remember that has progressively become worse and more painful. The patient has attempted conservative treatment without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment. PROCEDURE DETAILS: An IV was instituted by Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety strap across her lap. Copious amounts of Webril were placed around the right ankle followed by blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo block type fashion. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated to the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered to the operating field and the stockinet was reflected. The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. Attention was directed to the bunion deformity on the right foot. An approximately 6 cm dorsal medial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated with hemostasis. The skin and subcutaneous tissue were then undermined off of the capsule medially. A dorsal linear capsular incision was then created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The periosteum and capsule were then reflected off of the first metatarsal. There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence. The articular cartilage was healthy for patient's age and race. Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed.. A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was carried out until the adductor tendon insertions were identified. The adductor tendons were transected as well as a lateral capsulotomy was performed. The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected. Care was taken to preserve the extensor hallucis longus to make sure that tendon that was transected was the extensor hallucis brevis at the _______ digitorum. Extensor hallucis brevis tendon was transected and care was taken to preserve the extensor halucis longus tendon. Attention was then directed to medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw. Sagittal was then used to create a long dorsal arm outside the Austin type osteotomy and the first metatarsal. The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally until correction of the intermetatarsal angle was noted. The head was intact. A 0.45 K-wire was inserted through subcutaneously from proximal medial to distal lateral. A second K-wire was then inserted from distal lateral to proximal plantar medial. Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site. The K-wires were bent, cut, and pin caps were placed. Attention was then directed to the proximal phalanx of the hallux. The capsular periostem was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx. A sagittal was then used to create an akin osteotomy closing wedge. The apex was lateral and the base of the wedge was medial. The wedge was removed in the total and the osteotomy site was then feathered until closure was achieved without compression. Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted, one from distal medial to proximal lateral and the second from distal lateral to proximal medial across the osteotomy site. Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site and the osteotomy was closed. The toe was noted to be in a markedly more rectus position. Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining prominent medial eminence. The area was then smoothed with a reciprocating rasp. There was noted to be a small osteophytic formation laterally over first metatarsal head that was removed with a rongeur and smoothed with a reciprocating rasp. The area was then inspected for any remaining short bony edges, none were noted. Copious amounts of sterile saline was then used to flush the surgical site. The capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl. Subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular #5-0 Vicryl. Steri-Strips were applied and 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the surgical site. Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, copious Betadine, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot. A _______ cast was then applied postoperatively. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported from the operating room to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Tylenol #3 and instructed to take one q4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. for pain. The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Bunion on the right foot.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Bunion on the right foot.  \n**Procedure performed:** Austin/akin bunionectomy on the right foot.\n\n**History:**  \nA 77‑year‑old African‑American woman came to ABCD General Hospital because she has had a bunion on her right foot for as long as she can remember. The bunion has gotten worse and more painful over time. She tried non‑surgical treatments but they did not help, so she wants surgery.\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAn IV line was started by the anesthesia team before surgery. The patient was taken to the operating room, laid on her back, and secured with a safety strap. The right ankle was wrapped with a special band and a blood‑pressure cuff was placed. After the patient was sedated, the anesthesia team injected 15 cc of a 1:1 mix of 1 % lidocaine and 0.5 % Marcaine into the foot (a Mayo block). The foot was cleaned, draped, and raised. A tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg to stop bleeding. The foot was lowered into the surgical field, the bandage was removed, and the area was cleaned again.\n\nA 6 cm incision was made on the top‑medial side of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (the big‑toe joint). The incision was deepened with a #15 blade. Any blood vessels were tied off. The skin and tissue were lifted away from the joint capsule. A straight cut was made in the capsule over the joint. The periosteum (bone covering) and capsule were lifted off the first metatarsal bone. A prominent bump on the inside of the bone was seen. The cartilage looked healthy for her age and race.\n\nThe surgeon worked on the first interspace (the space between the first and second metatarsal bones). A lateral release was performed: sharp and blunt tools were used until the adductor tendons were found. These tendons were cut, and a lateral capsulotomy (cut in the capsule) was made. The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was found and cut, while the extensor hallucis longus tendon was preserved. The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was also cut, again keeping the long tendon intact.\n\nThe medial bump was removed with a sagittal saw. The saw was used to create a long dorsal cut outside the Austin osteotomy and the first metatarsal. The head of the first metatarsal was moved laterally until the angle between the metatarsal bones was corrected. The head was still intact. A 0.45 mm K‑wire was inserted from the inside‑medial side to the outside‑lateral side under the skin. A second K‑wire was inserted from the outside‑lateral side to the inside‑medial side. The wires held the osteotomy (bone cut) in place. The wires were bent, cut, and caps were added.\n\nNext, the surgeon worked on the base of the big toe. The capsule and periosteum were lifted off the base of the proximal phalanx. A sagittal saw made an A‑kin osteotomy (a wedge cut). The wedge’s apex was on the outside, and its base was on the inside. The wedge was removed, and the cut was feathered (smoothened) until it fit together without compression. Two 0.45 mm K‑wires were inserted across the osteotomy: one from inside‑medial to outside‑lateral, the other from outside‑lateral to inside‑medial. The osteotomy was closed and held in place. The toe was now straighter.\n\nThe remaining prominent bump on the inside was cut with a sagittal saw. The area was smoothed with a rasp. A small bony growth on the outside of the first metatarsal head was removed with a rongeur and smoothed. The area was checked for any sharp edges; none were found. A large amount of sterile saline flushed the surgical site.\n\nThe capsule was closed with #3‑0 Vicryl sutures. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4‑0 Vicryl, then a running subcuticular stitch with #5‑0 Vicryl. Steri‑Strips were applied. 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the surgical site. Dressings included #0‑1 silk, Betadine, 4 × 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The tourniquet was released, and a flush of blood was seen in all five toes. A cast was applied after surgery.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well, with no complications. She was moved to the recovery area with stable vital signs and good blood flow to the right foot. She was given a prescription for Tylenol #3 for pain and told to take one pill every 4‑6 hours as needed. She will follow up with Dr. X as directed."
