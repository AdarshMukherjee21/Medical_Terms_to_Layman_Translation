  "medical": "TIME SEEN: 0734 hours and 1034 hours. TOTAL RECORDING TIME: 27 hours 4 minutes. PATIENT HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old female with a history of events concerning for seizures. Video EEG monitoring is performed to capture events and/or identify etiology. VIDEO EEG DIAGNOSES 1. AWAKE: Normal. 2. SLEEP: No activation. 3. CLINICAL EVENTS: None. DESCRIPTION: Approximately 27 hours of continuous 21-channel digital video EEG monitoring was performed. The waking background is unchanged from that previously reported. Hyperventilation produced no changes in the resting record. Photic stimulation failed to elicit a well-developed photic driving response. Approximately five-and-half hours of spontaneous intermittent sleep was obtained. Sleep spindles were present and symmetric. The patient had no clinical events during the recording. CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: This is normal video EEG monitoring for a patient of this age. No interictal epileptiform activity was identified. The patient had no clinical events during the recording. Clinical correlation is required.",

Video EEG monitoring was done to capture any events and find out what’s causing them. VIDEO EEG DIAGNOSES 1. AWAKE: Normal. 2. SLEEP: No abnormal activity. 3. CLINICAL EVENTS: None. DESCRIPTION: We recorded 27 hours of continuous video EEG with 21 channels. The brain activity while she was awake was the same as before. Breathing faster (hyperventilation) did not change the resting record. Flashing lights (photic stimulation) did not produce a strong response. We got about five and a half hours of natural sleep. Sleep spindles were present and balanced on both sides. She had no noticeable events during the recording. CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: The video EEG is normal for someone her age. No signs of seizures were seen. She had no events during the recording. A clinician should review the results with her medical history."
