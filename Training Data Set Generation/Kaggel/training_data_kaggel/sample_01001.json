  "medical": "CC: Paraplegia. HX: This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time. On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb. She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with &quot;pins & needles&quot; sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g. On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal&lt;1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued. On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These titers were not known when she initially arrived at UIHC. Following administration of Praziquantel, she regained some sensation in BLE but the paraplegia, and urinary retention remained. MEDS: On 5/24/97 UIHC arrival: Prednisone 60mg qd, Zantac 50 IV qd, Propulsid 20mg tid, Enoxaparin 20mg qd. PMH: 1)G4P4. FHX: unremarkable. SHX: Missionary. Married. 4 children ( ages 7,5,3,6 weeks). EXAM: BP110/70, HR72, RR16, 35.6C MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Lucid thought process. CN: unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE strength. Lower extremities: 1/1 quads and hamstrings, 0/0 distally. Sensory: Decreased PP/LT/VIB from feet to inguinal regions, bilaterally. T12 sensory level to temperature (ice glove). Coord: normal FNF. Station/Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE. 0/0 BLE. No plantar responses, bilaterally. Rectal: decreased to no rectal tone. Guaiac negative. Other: No Lhermitte's sign. No paraspinal hypertonicity noted. No vertebral tenderness. Gen exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: MRI T-L-spine, 5/24/97, revealed a 6 x 8 x 25 soft tissue mass at the L1 level posterior to the tip of the conus medullaris and extending into the canal below that level. This appeared to be intradural. There was mild enhancement. There was more enhancement along the distal cord surface and cauda equina. The distal cord had sign of diffuse edema. She underwent exploratory and decompressive laminectomy on 5/27/97, and was retreated with a one day course of Praziquantel 40mg/kg/day. Praziquantel is reportedly only 80% effective at parasite eradication. She continued to reside on the Neurology/Neurosurgical service on 5/31/97 and remained paraplegic.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Paraplegia (paralysis of both legs).\n\n**History of present illness**\n\nA 32‑year‑old woman who works as a missionary in Nigeria had her fourth baby on 10 April 1997. The delivery was induced with Pitocin but otherwise went well.  \n\n* **Post‑delivery period:**  \n  * First 4 days after birth she had clear, watery diarrhea without blood and mild stomach discomfort. It stopped on its own.  \n  * In the second week she had 4–5 days of sinusitis with thick nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise fine until 4 May 1997.  \n\n* **Pain in the knees and shins (4 May 1997):**  \n  She felt a dull ache on the outer side of both knees and the upper shin bones. Massage didn’t help and the pain was worse when she sat or lay down. She had no loss of feeling at that time.  \n\n* **Progression of pain (6 May 1997):**  \n  She woke up with pain that spread from her knees to the front of her shins. Within a few hours the pain went around both calves, into the soles of her feet and up the back of her lower legs to her buttocks. Getting out of bed was hard and she needed help to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen helped only a little. By evening one foot’s sole was numb.  \n\n* **“Pins and needles” (9 May 1997):**  \n  She woke with a tingling sensation in both lower legs up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for pain and flew back to the larger city where she was based. During the one‑hour flight her leg weakness worsened to the point that she could not stand.  \n\n* **Local evaluation (10 May 1997):**  \n  * Upper leg strength 3/3 (normal), lower leg strength 4/4 (normal).  \n  * Sensation was normal up to the waist.  \n  * Mild lower‑back pain.  \n  * Blood tests: WBC 12.7 × 10⁹/L, ESR 10 mm/hr.  \n  * She was thought to have Guillain‑Barré syndrome and started on Solu‑Cortef 1000 mg once daily and Sandimmune IV IgG 12 g.  \n\n* **Transfer to Geneva (10 May 1997):**  \n  On arrival she had no feeling from her feet up to her groin on both sides. She had flaccid, areflexic paralysis of both legs and could not urinate or defecate. A straight catheter showed 1000 mL of urine left in the bladder.  \n\n* **CSF analysis (12 May 1997):**  \n  Protein 1.5 g/L, glucose 2.2 mmol/L, 92 WBCs (all lymphocytes), 70 RBCs, clear fluid, cultures negative.  \n  Broad‑spectrum antibiotics and Solu‑Medrol 1 g IV daily were started.  \n\n* **Imaging (12 May 1997):**  \n  * MRI of the thoracolumbar spine showed a small intradural lesion at T12‑L1 that barely enhanced with gadolinium and caused swelling of the spinal cord in that area.  \n  * Brain MRI was normal and showed no demyelinating disease.  \n\n* **Serology:**  \n  HIV, HTLV‑1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, malaria, CMV all negative.  \n  On 15 May 1997 a test for Schistosomiasis mekongi was positive at 1:320 (normal <1:80). CSF tests for the parasite on 12 May were negative.  \n\n* **Treatment for schistosomiasis (12 May 1997):**  \n  One‑day course of Praziquantel 3.6 g total (3 doses). Prednisone 60 mg PO daily was started; the antibiotics and Solu‑Medrol were stopped.  \n\n* **Rectal biopsy (22 May 1997):**  \n  Performed to check for parasite eradication. It was positive for parasite eggs and granulomas after she had left for the University of Illinois Hospital (UIHC). The organism was not speciated. CSF Schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These were not known when she first arrived at UIHC.  \n\n* **After Praziquantel:**  \n  She regained some feeling in both legs but remained paralyzed and could not urinate.  \n\n**Medications on arrival at UIHC (24 May 1997):**  \nPrednisone 60 mg daily, Zantac 50 mg IV daily, Propulsid 20 mg three times daily, Enoxaparin 20 mg daily.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \nG4P4 (four pregnancies, four births).  \n\n**Family history:** Unremarkable.  \n\n**Social history:** Missionary, married, four children (ages 7, 5, 3, and 6 weeks).  \n\n**Physical exam (24 May 1997):**  \n* BP 110/70 mm Hg, HR 72 bpm, RR 16/min, temperature 35.6 °C.  \n* Alert and oriented to person, place, time.  \n* Speech fluent, no slurred speech.  \n* Cranial nerves normal.  \n* Upper‑body strength 5/5 on both sides.  \n* Lower‑body strength: quadriceps and hamstrings 1/1 (normal), distal muscles 0/0 (no strength).  \n* Sensation decreased from the feet to the groin on both sides.  \n* Sensory level at T12 for temperature (ice glove test).  \n* Coordination normal.  \n* Reflexes 2/2 on both upper bodies, 0/0 on both lower bodies.  \n* No plantar reflexes.  \n* Rectal tone decreased to none.  \n* No Lhermitte’s sign, no neck stiffness, no back tenderness.  \n* Genital exam normal.  \n\n**Course (24 May 1997):**  \nMRI of the thoracolumbar spine showed a 6 × 8 × 25 mm soft‑tissue mass at L1 behind the tip of the conus medullaris, extending into the canal below. It was intradural, mildly enhanced, with more enhancement along the lower cord surface and cauda equina. The lower cord had diffuse swelling.  \n\n* **Surgery (27 May 1997):**  \n  Exploratory and decompressive laminectomy.  \n* **Repeat Praziquantel (27 May 1997):**  \n  One‑day course of 40 mg/kg/day.  \n  Praziquantel is only about 80 % effective at eradicating the parasite.  \n\n* **Status (31 May 1997):**  \n  She remained paralyzed in both legs and was still on the Neurology/Neurosurgery service."
