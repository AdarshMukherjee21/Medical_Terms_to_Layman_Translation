  "medical": "ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease reflux. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease reflux. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Postoperative ileus. PROCEDURES DONE: Hiatal hernia repair and Nissen fundoplication revision. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 18-year-old male who has had a history of a Nissen fundoplication performed six years ago for gastric reflux. Approximately one year ago, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and CT scan at that time showed that he had a hiatal hernia. Over the past year, this has caused him an increasing number of problems, including chest pain when he eats, and shortness of breath after large meals. He is also having reflux symptoms again. He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication. HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure. He was stable at that time. He did complain of some nausea. However, he did not have any vomiting at that time. He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o. He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol. On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed. Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows. He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting. Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications. He ambulated frequently. He remained n.p.o. for three days. He also had the NG tube in during that time. On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued. He was advanced to a liquid diet and tolerated this without any complications. At this time, he was still using the PCA for pain control. However, he was using it much less frequently than on days #1 and #2 postoperatively. After tolerating the full liquid diet without any complications, he was advanced to a soft diet and his pain medications were transitioned to p.o. medications rather than the PCA. The PCA was discontinued. He tolerated the soft diet without any complications and continued to have flatus frequently. On postoperative day #6, it was determined that he was stable for discharge to home as he was taking p.o. without any complications. His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain medications. He was passing gas frequently, had excellent urine output, and was ambulating frequently without any issues. DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. DISPOSITION: Discharged to home. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was discharged to home with instructions for maintaining a soft diet. It was also recommended that he does not drink any soda postoperatively. He is instructed to keep his incision site clean and dry and it was also recommended that he avoid any heavy lifting. He will be able to attend school when it starts in a few weeks. However, he is not going to be able to play football in the near future. He was given prescription for pain medication upon discharge. He is instructed to contact Pediatric Surgery if he has any fevers, any nausea and vomiting, any chest pain, any constipation, or any other concerns.",

About a year ago he was in a car accident; a CT scan then showed he had a hiatal hernia. Over the last year the hernia has caused more problems: chest pain after eating, shortness of breath after large meals, and return of reflux symptoms. He came to us for hernia repair and to revise the earlier fundoplication.\n\n**Hospital course:**  \nMr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor at Brenner Children’s Hospital after his surgery. He was stable but had some nausea; he did not vomit. He had a nasogastric (NG) tube and was not allowed to eat or drink (NPO). Pain was managed with a patient‑controlled analgesia (PCA) pump and Toradol.\n\nOn postoperative day 1 he could not urinate, so a Foley catheter was inserted. He had nausea again but no vomiting. The catheter was removed later when he was producing good urine. He walked around often. He stayed NPO for three days and still had the NG tube.\n\nOn day 4 he started passing gas, so the NG tube was removed. He was given a liquid diet, which he tolerated well. He still used the PCA but less often than on days 1 and 2. After he could drink liquids without problems, he was switched to a soft diet and his pain was moved to oral medications. The PCA was stopped. He tolerated the soft diet and kept passing gas.\n\nOn day 6 he was ready to go home: he could eat and drink orally without issues, his pain was controlled with oral meds, he was passing gas, had good urine output, and was walking well.\n\n**Discharge condition:** Stable.  \n**Disposition:** Home.\n\n**Discharge instructions:**  \n- Keep a soft diet.  \n- Do not drink soda after surgery.  \n- Keep the incision clean and dry; avoid heavy lifting.  \n- He can return to school in a few weeks but should not play football for a while.  \n- He was given a prescription for pain medication.  \n- Contact Pediatric Surgery if he develops fever, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, constipation, or any other concerns."
