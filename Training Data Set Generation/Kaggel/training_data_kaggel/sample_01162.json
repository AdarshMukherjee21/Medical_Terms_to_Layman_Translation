  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Colon cancer screening and family history of polyps. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Colonic polyps. PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. ANESTHESIA: MAC DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The mucosa was normal throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum. Two polyps were identified and were removed. The first was a 7-mm sessile lesion in the mid transverse colon at 110 cm, removed with the snare without cautery and retrieved. The second was a small 4-mm sessile lesion in the sigmoid colon at 20 cm also removed with the snare and retrieved. No other lesions were identified. Numerous diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon. A retroflex through the anorectal junction showed moderate internal hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Sigmoid diverticulosis. 2. Colonic polyps in the transverse colon and sigmoid colon, benign appearance, removed. 3. Internal hemorrhoids. 4. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Follow up biopsy report. 2. Follow up with Dr. X as needed. 3. Screening colonoscopy in 5 years.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑op diagnosis:** Colon cancer screening; family history of polyps.  \n**Post‑op diagnosis:** Colonic polyps.\n\n**Procedure:** Colonoscopy.  \n**Anesthesia:** Moderate conscious sedation (MAC).\n\n**What was done:**  \nA small, flexible colonoscope was gently inserted through the rectum and moved through the colon to the cecum, then through the ileocecal valve into the end of the small intestine (terminal ileum). The bowel prep was excellent, so all areas were clearly visible. The lining of the colon and terminal ileum looked normal. Two polyps were found and removed.  \n- The first was a 7‑mm flat polyp in the middle of the transverse colon at 110 cm from the anus. It was removed with a snare (no cautery) and taken out.  \n- The second was a 4‑mm flat polyp in the sigmoid colon at 20 cm from the anus. It was also removed with a snare and taken out.  \nNo other abnormal spots were seen. Many small pouches (diverticula) were seen in the sigmoid colon. A backward look through the anus showed moderate internal hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery.\n\n**Final diagnoses:**  \n1. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.  \n2. Benign polyps in the transverse and sigmoid colon, both removed.  \n3. Internal hemorrhoids.  \n4. The rest of the colon and terminal ileum were normal.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Wait for the biopsy results.  \n2. Follow up with Dr. X as needed.  \n3. Schedule a screening colonoscopy in 5 years."
