  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. PROCEDURE 1. Radical retropubic prostatectomy, robotic assisted. 2. Bladder suspension. ANESTHESIA: General by intubation. The patient understands his diagnosis, grade, stage and prognosis. He understands this procedure, options to it and potential benefits from it. He strongly wishes to proceed. He accepts all treatment-associated risks to include but not be limited to bleeding requiring transfusion; infection; sepsis; heart attack; stroke; bladder neck contractures; need to convert to an open procedure; urinary fistulae; impotence; incontinence; injury to bowel/rectum/bladder/ureters, etc.; small-bowel obstruction; abdominal hernia; osteitis pubis/chronic pelvic pain, etc. DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE: The patient was taken to the operating room, given a successful general anesthetic, placed in the lithotomy position, prepped with Betadine solutions and draped in the usual sterile fashion. My camera ports were then placed in the standard fan array. A camera port was placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique. The balloon port was placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other ports were placed under direct vision. My assistant was on the right. The patient was then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked. I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligaments and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligaments deep into the pelvis. This nicely exposed the space of Retzius. I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia. The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally. The levator ani muscles were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally. Dissection was continued posteriorly toward the bundles and caudally to the apex. The puboprostatic ligaments were then transected. A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl was placed around the dorsal venous complex. I then approached the bladder neck. The anterior bladder neck was transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which was lifted anteriorly in the wound. I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampullae of the vas. The ampullae were mobilized and transected. These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized. Hemostasis was obtained using the bipolar Bovie. I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this was incised sharply. Dissection was continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles. I was able to then identify the pedicles over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected. The field was then copiously irrigated with sterile water. Hemostasis was found to be complete. I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis. This was accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures. Two of these were tied together in the midline. They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one was run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied. A new Foley catheter was then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation. The patient was given indigo carmine, and there was prompt blue urine in the Foley. I then carried out a bladder suspension. This was done in hopes of obtaining early urinary control. This was accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures. One was placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis. This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder. The prostate was then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision. A JP drain was brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk. The camera port fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl. The skin incisions were closed with a running, subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl. The patient tolerated the procedure very well. There were no complications. Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.",

Robotic‑assisted removal of the prostate (radical retropubic prostatectomy).  \n2. Bladder suspension to help with early urinary control.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia with intubation.  \n\nThe patient was fully informed about his diagnosis, the stage of the cancer, and the likely outcome. He understood the surgery, the alternatives, and the possible benefits. He chose to go ahead with the operation and accepted all the risks that could come from the treatment, including but not limited to: bleeding that might need a blood transfusion; infection; sepsis; heart attack; stroke; narrowing of the bladder neck; the need to switch to an open surgery; leaks from the urinary tract; loss of sexual function; incontinence; damage to the bowel, rectum, bladder, or ureters; small‑bowel blockage; abdominal hernia; pain in the pelvic area; and other complications.  \n\n**Description of the case:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, given general anesthesia, positioned on his back with legs apart (lithotomy position), and cleaned with Betadine. The surgical team set up the robotic camera and instruments in the usual pattern. A small incision was made above the belly button to insert the camera, and the abdomen was inflated with gas so the organs could be seen. The patient was tilted slightly backward (Trendelenburg position) to let the bladder fall toward the floor, and the robot was docked.  \n\nThe surgeon cut the bladder away from the surrounding tissue by making a small cut between the two medial umbilical ligaments and moving the cut laterally into the pelvis. This opened the space called the space of Retzius. The front surface of the prostate and the surrounding fascia were cleaned and cut open on both sides. The pelvic floor muscles were carefully moved aside. The dissection continued toward the back and down to the tip of the prostate. The ligaments that hold the prostate to the pubic bone were cut. A strong suture (0 Vicryl) was tied around the main vein that runs along the back of the prostate.  \n\nThe surgeon then cut the front part of the bladder neck down to the level of the catheter, lifting the catheter forward. The back part of the bladder neck was cut down to the level of the vas deferens. The vas deferens were lifted and cut, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were also lifted and cut. Blood was controlled with a bipolar cautery device.  \n\nThe surgeon found the fascia between the prostate and rectum (Denonvilliers fascia) and cut it sharply. The dissection moved down along the front of the rectum and out to the sides. The blood vessels over the seminal vesicles were clipped and cut. The area was washed thoroughly with sterile water, and bleeding was stopped.  \n\nA new connection between the urethra and bladder (urethrovesical anastomosis) was made using 3‑0 Monocryl stitches. Two stitches were tied together in the middle. They were placed at the bottom (6 o’clock) and then one was tied clockwise and the other counter‑clockwise up to the top (12 o’clock) to secure the connection. A new catheter was inserted into the bladder and flushed; blue dye (indigo carmine) showed that urine was flowing properly.  \n\nBladder suspension was performed to help the bladder stay in place and improve early urinary control. Two 0 Vicryl sutures were used: one went through the bladder neck and the main vein, the other went from the front of the bladder to the back of the pubic bone. This pulled the bladder back into its normal position.  \n\nThe prostate was placed in a bag and removed through a slightly larger camera incision. A drain (JP drain) was put in through the fourth arm port and tied to the skin. The camera incision was closed with running 0 Vicryl stitches. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch using 4‑0 Monocryl.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the surgery well, with no complications. All sponges and instruments were counted correctly at the end of the case."
