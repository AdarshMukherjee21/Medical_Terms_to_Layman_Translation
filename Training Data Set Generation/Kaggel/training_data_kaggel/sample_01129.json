  "medical": "REASON FOR CT SCAN: The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008. I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving. CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm. The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm. There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle. He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left. ASSESSMENT: The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0. PLAN: I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting.",
  "layman": "REASON FOR CT SCAN: A 79‑year‑old man with adult hydrocephalus had large fluid collections on a CT scan taken on January 16, 2008. On February 12, 2008, the doctor increased his shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0. His family had a repeat CT scan to see if the fluid was getting better. The CT from March 11, 2008 shows the front part of his brain (frontal horn) is 2.6 cm wide at the level of the foramen of Munro. The third ventricle is flat and 10 mm wide. He has one shunt that starts on the right side of his skull and ends in the left lateral ventricle. He now has symmetrical fluid collections on both sides of the brain that are less than 1 cm wide each, which is smaller than the January 16, 2008 scan that reported 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left. ASSESSMENT: The fluid collections are still visible but are getting smaller with the shunt setting at 2.0. PLAN: I want to get a new head CT in about three months to decide if the setting of 2.0 should stay or if we should change it."
