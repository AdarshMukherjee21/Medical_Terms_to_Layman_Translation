  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: Aortic valve replacement. Assessment of stenotic valve. Evaluation for thrombus on the valve. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Atrial valve replacement. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Moderate stenosis of aortic valve replacement. Mild mitral regurgitation. Normal left ventricular function. PROCEDURES IN DETAIL: The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits. The patient agreed and signed the consent form. The patient received a total of 3 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl for conscious sedation and pain control. The oropharynx anesthetized with benzocaine spray and lidocaine solution. Esophageal intubation was done with no difficulty with the second attempt. In a semi-Fowler position, the probe was passed to transthoracic views at about 40 to 42 cm. Multiple pictures obtained. Assessment of the peak velocity was done later. The probe was pulled to the mid esophageal level. Different pictures including short-axis views of the aortic valve was done. Extubation done with no problems and no blood on the probe. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complications. INTERPRETATION: The left atrium was mildly dilated. No masses or thrombi were seen. The left atrial appendage was free of thrombus. Pulse wave interrogation showed peak velocities of 60 cm per second. The left ventricle was normal in size and contractility with mild LVH. EF is normal and preserved. The right atrium and right ventricle were both normal in size. Mitral valve showed no vegetations or prolapse. There was mild-to-moderate regurgitation on color flow interrogation. Aortic valve was well-seated mechanical valve, bileaflet with acoustic shadowing beyond the valve noticed. No perivalvular leak was noticed. There was increased velocity across the valve with peak velocity of 3.2 m/sec with calculated aortic valve area by continuity equation at 1.2 cm2 indicative of moderate aortic valve stenosis based on criteria for native heart valves. No AIC. Pulmonic valve was somewhat difficult to see because of acoustic shadowing from the aortic valve. Overall showed no abnormalities. The tricuspid valve was structurally normal. Interatrial septum appeared to be intact, confirmed by color flow interrogation as well as agitated saline contrast study. The aorta and aortic arch were unremarkable. No dissection. IMPRESSION: 1. Mildly dilated left atrium. 2. Mild-to-moderate regurgitation. 3. Well-seated mechanical aortic valve with peak velocity of 3.2 m/sec and calculated valve area of 1.2 cm2 consistent with moderate aortic stenosis. Reevaluation in two to three years with transthoracic echocardiogram will be recommended.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam**  \nThe doctor wanted to check the new aortic valve that was put in, see how tight it is, and look for any blood clots on it.\n\n**Pre‑operative diagnosis**  \nAortic valve replacement.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \n- Moderate narrowing of the new aortic valve  \n- Mild leaking of the mitral valve  \n- Normal pumping function of the left ventricle\n\n**Procedure details**  \nThe doctor explained the procedure, its risks and benefits. The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  \nThe patient was given 3 mg of Versed and 50 µg of fentanyl to stay calm and comfortable.  \nThe throat was numbed with benzocaine spray and lidocaine.  \nAn esophageal probe was inserted without trouble on the second try.  \nWhile the patient was in a slightly upright position, the probe was moved to the chest to get images at about 40–42 cm.  \nSeveral pictures were taken. Later, the speed of blood flow was measured.  \nThe probe was then moved to a mid‑esophageal position. More pictures, including short‑axis views of the aortic valve, were taken.  \nThe probe was removed without any problems and no blood was seen on it.  \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and had no immediate complications.\n\n**Interpretation**  \n- The left atrium is a little enlarged.  \n- No tumors or clots were seen.  \n- The left atrial appendage has no clots.  \n- Blood flow speed was 60 cm/s.  \n- The left ventricle is normal in size and strength, with a slight thickening of the wall.  \n- The ejection fraction (how much blood the heart pumps) is normal.  \n- The right atrium and right ventricle are normal in size.  \n- The mitral valve shows no growths or prolapse, but there is mild‑to‑moderate leaking.  \n- The mechanical aortic valve is in place and looks good. A shadow from the valve is seen beyond it. No leak around the valve.  \n- Blood flows faster across the valve, with a peak speed of 3.2 m/s. Using the continuity equation, the valve area is 1.2 cm², which means moderate narrowing of the aortic valve.  \n- No atrial‑to‑ventricular conduction problem.  \n- The pulmonic valve is hard to see because of the shadow from the aortic valve.  \n- No other problems were found.  \n- The tricuspid valve is normal.  \n- The wall between the two atria (interatrial septum) looks intact, confirmed by color flow and a saline contrast study.  \n- The aorta and aortic arch are normal. No dissection.\n\n**Impression**  \n1. Left atrium slightly enlarged.  \n2. Mild‑to‑moderate valve leaking.  \n3. Mechanical aortic valve is well positioned; blood speed is 3.2 m/s and valve area is 1.2 cm², indicating moderate aortic valve narrowing.  \nA repeat transthoracic echo in 2–3 years is recommended."
