  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumors, multiple. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Brain tumors multiple - adenocarcinoma and metastasis from breast. PROCEDURE: Occipital craniotomy, removal of large tumor using the inner hemispheric approach, stealth system operating microscope and CUSA. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the prone position after general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor. Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor. The bone flap was elevated. The ultrasound was then used. The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure. We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation. We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile. We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy. Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely. We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus. After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used. We obtained access to the tumor. We biopsied this and submitted it. This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer. Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total. After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery. The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates. The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle. This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage. The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap. The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures. The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp. The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation. Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy. The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Multiple brain tumors.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Multiple brain tumors – one is an adenocarcinoma that has spread from the breast.\n\n**Procedure:**  \nThe patient was put on general anesthesia and laid face‑down. The scalp was cleaned and covered. A special microscope and a navigation system (stealth) were used to find the tumor. A small ultrasonic device (CUSA) helped remove the tumor.\n\nA horizontal cut was made in the scalp, the skin and connective tissue were lifted, and a square piece of skull was removed by drilling holes over the tumor. The skull piece was lifted away. Ultrasound showed the tumors were in the space between the two brain hemispheres. The covering of the brain (dura) was tight, so 4 ounces of mannitol were given to reduce swelling and make the brain more mobile. A small hole was made in the brain’s fluid space (ventriculostomy) to help the brain relax.\n\nThe dura was cut in an inverted‑U shape above the superior sagittal sinus. With the microscope and gentle retraction, the surgeon reached the tumor. A biopsy was taken and sent for analysis, which showed a malignant tumor that matched breast cancer. The tumor was then largely removed with the CUSA and taken out completely. The cavity was washed with fluid and bleeding was stopped with a cautery device.\n\nAfter removal, a large piece of Duragen (a dural substitute) was placed over the opening, and the skull piece was put back and fixed with plates. Because the tumor had extended into the brain’s fluid space, a ventricular catheter was left in place, brought out through a separate incision, and connected to a sterile drain. The wound was closed: the connective tissue was stitched with 2‑0 Vicryl, the skin with 3‑0 nylon in a mattress pattern. Sterile dressings were applied.\n\nThe patient went to recovery in stable condition and remained hemodynamically stable during the operation. The surgery was an occipital craniotomy with total removal of a large metastatic tumor in the parietal lobe using the CUSA, ultrasound, and navigation‑guided ventriculostomy. A second operation will be performed later today to remove another large tumor in the back part of the brain (posterior fossa)."
