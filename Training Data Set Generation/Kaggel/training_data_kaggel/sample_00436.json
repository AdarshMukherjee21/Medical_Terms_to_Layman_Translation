  "medical": "CC: Found down. HX: 54y/o RHF went to bed at 10 PM at her boyfriend's home on 1/16/96. She was found lethargic by her son the next morning. Three other individuals in the house were lethargic and complained of HA that same morning. Her last memory was talking to her granddaughter at 5:00PM on 1/16/96. She next remembered riding in the ambulance from a Hospital. Initial Carboxyhemoglobin level was 24% (normal &lt; 1.5%) and ABG 7.41/30/370 with O2Sat 75% on 100%FiO2. MEDS: unknown anxiolytic, estrogen. PMH: PUD, ?stroke and memory difficulty in the past 1-2 years. FHX: unknown. SHX: divorced. unknown history of tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP126/91, HR86, RR 30, 37.1C. MS: Oriented to name only. Speech without dysarthria. 2/3 recall at 5minutes. CN: unremarkable. MOTOR: full strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk. SENSORY: unremarkable. COORD/STATION: unremarkable. GAIT: not tested on admission. GEN EXAM: notable for erythema of the face and chest. COURSE: She underwent a total of four dives under Hyperbaric Oxygen ( 2 dives on 1/17 and 2 dives on 1/18). Neuropsychologic assessment on 1/18/96 revealed marked cognitive impairments with defects in anterograde memory, praxis, associative fluency, attention, and speed of information processing. She was discharged home on 1/19/96 and returned on 2/11/96 after neurologic deterioration. She progressively developed more illogical behavior, anhedonia, anorexia and changes in sleep pattern. She became completely dependent and could not undergo repeat neuropsychologic assessment in 2/96. She was later transferred to another care facility against medical advice. The etiology for these changes became complicated by a newly discovered history of possible ETOH abuse and usual &quot;anxiety&quot; disorder. MRI brain, 2/14/96, revealed increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, bilaterally. EEG showed diffuse slowing without epileptiform activity.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Found unconscious.  \n**History:** A 54‑year‑old woman with a history of heart failure was at her boyfriend’s house on January 16, 1996. She went to bed at 10 p.m. The next morning her son found her very sleepy. Three other people in the house were also sleepy and had headaches that morning. Her last clear memory was talking to her granddaughter at 5 p.m. on the same day. She next remembered being in an ambulance at the hospital.  \n\n**Initial tests:**  \n- Carboxyhemoglobin (a measure of carbon‑monoxide poisoning) was 24 % (normal < 1.5 %).  \n- Arterial blood gas: pH 7.41, CO₂ 30 mm Hg, O₂ 370 mm Hg, oxygen saturation 75 % while breathing 100 % oxygen.  \n\n**Medications:** Unknown anti‑anxiety drug and estrogen.  \n**Past medical history:** Peptic ulcer disease, possible stroke, and memory problems in the last 1–2 years.  \n**Family history:** Unknown.  \n**Social history:** Divorced; no known tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.  \n\n**Physical exam on arrival:**  \n- Blood pressure 126/91 mm Hg, heart rate 86 bpm, breathing 30 breaths/min, temperature 37.1 °C.  \n- She only knew her own name.  \n- Speech was clear.  \n- She could remember 2 of 3 items after 5 minutes.  \n- Cranial nerves, muscle strength, tone, and sensation were normal.  \n- Coordination and balance were normal.  \n- Gait was not tested.  \n- Face and chest had redness.  \n\n**Course:**  \nShe received four hyperbaric oxygen treatments (two on January 17 and two on January 18). A neuropsychological test on January 18 showed serious problems with new memory, hand‑eye coordination, word finding, attention, and thinking speed. She was sent home on January 19 but came back on February 11 because her neurological status worsened. She developed odd behavior, loss of interest, loss of appetite, and sleep changes. She became totally dependent and could not do another neuropsychological test in February. She was later moved to another care facility against medical advice. The cause of her changes was complicated by a newly discovered possible alcohol abuse and a typical “anxiety” disorder.  \n\n**Imaging:**  \n- Brain MRI on February 14 showed increased signal in the white matter near the brain’s ventricles on both sides.  \n- EEG showed slow brain waves but no seizure activity."
