  "medical": "PROCEDURES: 1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy. 2. Colonoscopy with polypectomy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. History of esophageal cancer. 2. History of colonic polyps. POSTOPERATIVE FINDINGS: 1. Intact surgical intervention for a history of esophageal cancer. 2. Melanosis coli. 3. Transverse colon polyps in the setting of surgical changes related to partial and transverse colectomy. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 250 mcg and 9 mg of Versed. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 55-year-old dentist presenting for surveillance upper endoscopy in the setting of a history of esophageal cancer with staging at T2N0M0. He also has a history of adenomatous polyps and presents for surveillance of this process. Informed consent was obtained after explanation of the procedures, as well as risk factors of bleeding, perforation, and adverse medication reaction. ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and medicated with the above medications to achieve and maintain a conscious sedation. Vital signs were monitored throughout the procedure without evidence of hemodynamic compromise or desaturation. The Olympus single-channel endoscope was passed under direct visualization, through the oral cavity, and advanced to the second portion of the duodenum. FINDINGS: 1. ESOPHAGUS: Anatomy consistent with esophagectomy with colonic transposition. 2. STOMACH: Revealed colonic transposition with normal mucosa. 3. DUODENUM: Normal. IMPRESSION: Intact surgical intervention with esophagectomy colonic transposition. COLONOSCOPY: The patient was then turned and a colonic 140-series colonoscope was passed under direct visualization through the anal verge and advanced to the cecum as identified by the appendiceal orifice. Circumferential visualization the colonic mucosa revealed the following: 1. Cecum revealed melanosis coli. 2. Ascending, melanosis coli. 3. Transverse revealed two diminutive sessile polyps, excised by cold forceps technique and submitted to histology as specimen #1 with surgical changes consistent with partial colectomy related to the colonic transposition. 4. Descending, melanosis coli. 5. Sigmoid, melanosis coli. 6. Rectum, melanosis coli. IMPRESSION: Diffuse melanosis coli with incidental finding of transverse colon polyps. RECOMMENDATION: Follow-up histology. Continue fiber with avoidance of stimulant laxatives.",
  "layman": "**Procedures:**  \n1. Upper digestive tract exam (esophagogastroduodenoscopy).  \n2. Colon exam with removal of polyps (colonoscopy with polypectomy).\n\n**Pre‑operative diagnoses:**  \n1. Past esophageal cancer.  \n2. Past colon polyps.\n\n**Post‑operative findings:**  \n1. Surgery for the esophageal cancer was done correctly.  \n2. Dark brown discoloration of the colon lining (melanosis coli).  \n3. Small polyps in the middle part of the colon, seen after surgery that removed part of the colon and moved part of it to the esophagus.\n\n**Medications used:**  \nFentanyl 250 mcg and 9 mg of Versed (midazolam).\n\n**Reason for visit:**  \nA 55‑year‑old dentist came for routine checks because of a history of esophageal cancer (stage T2N0M0) and a history of adenomatous polyps. Consent was obtained after explaining the procedures and the risks of bleeding, perforation, and medication reactions.\n\n**Upper endoscopy:**  \nThe patient lay on his left side and was sedated with the medications above. Vital signs were watched the whole time and stayed normal. An Olympus single‑channel scope was passed through the mouth and into the second part of the small intestine.  \n- **Esophagus:** Looks like the esophagus was removed and replaced with a piece of colon.  \n- **Stomach:** Shows the colon piece in place and the lining looks normal.  \n- **Duodenum:** Normal.  \n**Conclusion:** The esophageal surgery with colon replacement was done correctly.\n\n**Colonoscopy:**  \nThe patient was turned and a 140‑series colonoscope was inserted through the anus and advanced to the cecum (identified by the opening of the appendix). The entire colon lining was examined and showed:  \n1. **Cecum:** Dark brown discoloration (melanosis coli).  \n2. **Ascending colon:** Melanosis coli.  \n3. **Transverse colon:** Two small, flat polyps were removed with cold forceps and sent for lab testing. The surrounding tissue shows changes from the partial colon removal that was part of the esophageal surgery.  \n4. **Descending colon:** Melanosis coli.  \n5. **Sigmoid colon:** Melanosis coli.  \n6. **Rectum:** Melanosis coli.  \n**Conclusion:** Dark brown discoloration throughout the colon and a few small polyps in the middle colon.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nSend the removed polyps for pathology. Keep eating fiber and avoid stimulant laxatives."
