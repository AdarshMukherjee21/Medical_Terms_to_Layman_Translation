ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Zero. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, and after obtaining adequate general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position. The abdominal area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A small skin incision was made below the umbilicus. It was carried down in the transverse direction on the side of her old incision. It was carried down to the fascia. An open pneumoperitoneum was created with Hasson technique. Three additional ports were placed in the usual fashion. The gallbladder was found to be acutely inflamed, distended, and with some necrotic areas. It was carefully retracted from the isthmus, and the cystic structure was then carefully identified, dissected, and divided between double clips. The gallbladder was then taken down from the gallbladder fossa with electrocautery. There was some bleeding from the gallbladder fossa that was meticulously controlled with a Bovie. The gallbladder was then finally removed via the umbilical port with some difficulty because of the size of the gallbladder and size of the stones. The fascia had to be opened. The gallbladder had to be opened, and the stones had to be extracted carefully. When it was completed, I went back to the abdomen and achieved complete hemostasis. The ports were then removed under direct vision with the scope. The fascia of the umbilical wound was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl. All the incisions were injected with 0.25% Marcaine, closed with 4-0 Monocryl, Steri-Strips, and sterile dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure satisfactorily and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",

She was laid on her back. The belly was cleaned and covered in a sterile way. A small cut was made below the belly button, along the side of her old scar. The cut was deepened to the muscle layer. A small opening was made in the belly wall using the Hasson technique to allow air into the abdomen. Three more small ports were inserted in the usual places. The gallbladder was found to be very inflamed, swollen, and had some dead tissue. It was gently pulled away from the liver and the cystic duct and artery were carefully identified, cut, and tied with two clips. The gallbladder was then cut from the liver bed with a cautery device. Some bleeding came from the liver bed, which was stopped carefully with a cautery wand. The gallbladder was removed through the belly‑button port, but it was a bit hard because it was large and had big stones. The belly‑button opening had to be widened. The gallbladder was opened and the stones were taken out carefully. After that, the surgeon checked the abdomen again and made sure there was no more bleeding. The ports were taken out while watching with the camera. The belly‑button wound was closed with a figure‑of‑eight stitch using 0 Vicryl. All the cuts were given a local anesthetic (0.25% Marcaine), closed with 4‑0 Monocryl stitches, covered with Steri‑Strips, and a sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
