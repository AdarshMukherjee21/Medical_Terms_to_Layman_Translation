The bone has cracks called pars defects, which make the spine unstable and cause nerve pain.  \n**Secondary diagnosis:** Chronic pain syndrome.  \n\n**Main procedure:** A L5 surgery (Gill procedure) was done. The surgeon used cages, bone graft, a protein that helps bone grow, and screws to fuse the spine all around the joint (360 degrees). Dr. X performed the surgery on 01/08/08.  \n\n**Brief hospital course:** The patient is a man who has had long‑standing pain in his back, buttocks, and both legs. He was checked and found to have cracks in both sides of the L5‑S1 area, causing instability. He was admitted and had the surgery described above, which went smoothly.
