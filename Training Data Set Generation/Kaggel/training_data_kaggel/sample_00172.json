  "medical": "CC: Left-sided weakness. HX: This 28y/o RHM was admitted to a local hospital on 6/30/95 for a 7 day history of fevers, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, urinary frequency, myalgias and generalized weakness. He denied foreign travel, IV drug abuse, homosexuality, recent dental work, or open wound. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Staphylococcus Aureus, oxacillin sensitive. He was place on appropriate antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity.. A 7/3/95 transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and a damaged mitral valve with regurgitation. Later that day he developed left-sided weakness and severe dysarthria and aphasia. HCT, on 7/3/95 revealed mild attenuated signal in the right hemisphere. On 7/4/95 he developed first degree AV block, and was transferred to UIHC. MEDS: Nafcillin 2gm IV q4hrs, Rifampin 600mg q12hrs, Gentamicin 130mg q12hrs. PMH: 1) Heart murmur dx age 5 years. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Employed cook. Denied ETOH/Tobacco/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP 123/54, HR 117, RR 16, 37.0C MS: Somnolent and arousable only by shaking and repetitive verbal commands. He could follow simple commands only. He nodded appropriately to questioning most of the time. Dysarthric speech with sparse verbal output. CN: Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Conjugate gaze preference toward the right. Right hemianopia by visual threat testing. Optic discs flat and no retinal hemorrhages or Roth spots were seen. Left lower facial weakness. Tongue deviated to the left. Weak gag response, bilaterally. Weak left corneal response. MOTOR: Dense left flaccid hemiplegia. SENSORY: Less responsive to PP on left. COORD: Unable to test. Station and Gait: Not tested. Reflexes: 2/3 throughout (more brisk on the left side). Left ankle clonus and a Left Babinski sign were present. GEN EXAM: Holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium. Janeway lesions were present in the feet and hands. No Osler's nodes were seen. COURSE: 7/6/95, HCT showed a large RMCA stroke with mass shift. His neurologic exam worsened and he was intubated, hyperventilated, and given IV Mannitol. He then underwent emergent left craniectomy and duraplasty. He tolerated the procedure well and his brain was allowed to swell. He then underwent mitral valve replacement on 7/11/95 with a St. Judes valve. His post-operative recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pericardial effusion and dysphagia. He required temporary PEG placement for feeding. The 7/27/95, 8/6/95 and 10/18/96 HCT scans show the chronologic neuroradiologic documentation of a large RMCA stroke. His 10/18/96 Neurosurgery Clinic visit noted that he can ambulate without assistance with the use of a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. His proximal LLE strength was rated at a 4. His LUE was plegic. He had a seizure 6 days prior to his 10/18/96 evaluation. This began as a Jacksonian march of shaking in the LUE; then involved the LLE. There was no LOC or tongue-biting. He did have urinary incontinence. He was placed on DPH. His speech was dysarthric but fluent. He appeared bright, alert and oriented in all spheres.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: weakness on the left side.  \nHistory: A 28‑year‑old man who has had a heart murmur since he was 5 was admitted to a local hospital on June 30, 1995 after a week of fever, chills, sweating, loss of appetite, frequent urination, muscle aches, and overall weakness. He said he had not traveled abroad, used IV drugs, had recent dental work, or had any open wounds. Blood and urine tests grew Staphylococcus aureus that was sensitive to oxacillin, so he was started on antibiotics that matched the test results. A transthoracic echocardiogram on July 3, 1995 showed normal heart pumping but a damaged mitral valve that was leaking. Later that day he developed weakness on the left side, severe slurred speech, and trouble speaking. A head CT on July 3 showed a small abnormal area in the right side of his brain. On July 4 he developed a first‑degree heart block and was transferred to the University of Illinois Hospital.  \n\nMedications: Nafcillin 2 g IV every 4 hours, Rifampin 600 mg every 12 hours, Gentamicin 130 mg every 12 hours.  \n\nPast medical history: heart murmur diagnosed at age 5.  \nFamily history: none notable.  \nSocial history: works as a cook, does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illegal drugs.  \n\nExamination: Blood pressure 123/54, heart rate 117, breathing 16 breaths per minute, temperature 37.0 °C. He was sleepy and could only be awakened by shaking or repeated talking. He could follow simple instructions and nodded most of the time. Speech was slurred and he spoke little. Eyes: pupils equal and 3 mm, constricting to 2 mm with light. He turned his eyes to the right. He could not see the right side of his vision. His optic discs were normal, with no eye bleeding or spots. He had weakness of the lower part of his left face. His tongue turned left. His gag reflex was weak on both sides. His left eye blink reflex was weak.  \n\nMotor: complete flaccid paralysis on the left side.  \nSensory: less feeling on the left side.  \nCoordination could not be tested.  \nReflexes were normal but a bit stronger on the left. He had ankle clonus and a positive Babinski sign on the left.  \n\nGeneral exam: a holosystolic heart murmur heard all over the chest. Small red spots on his feet and hands (Janeway lesions). No painful nodules on his fingers (Osler nodes).  \n\nCourse: On July 6, 1995 a head CT showed a large stroke in the right middle cerebral artery territory with brain swelling. His neurological status worsened; he was intubated, given high‑rate breathing, and received IV mannitol. He then had an emergency left craniectomy and duraplasty. He tolerated the surgery and his brain was allowed to swell. On July 11, 1995 he had a mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude valve. After surgery he developed pneumonia, fluid around the heart, and trouble swallowing, requiring a temporary feeding tube. Head CT scans on July 27, 1995; August 6, 1995; and October 18, 1996 documented the large stroke. At a neurosurgery clinic visit on October 18, 1996 he could walk without help using a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. His upper leg strength was rated 4 out of 5; his left arm was paralyzed. He had a seizure six days before that visit. The seizure started as a Jacksonian march of shaking in the left arm and then involved the left leg. He did not lose consciousness or bite his tongue, but he did have urinary incontinence. He was started on DPH. His speech remained slurred but fluent. He was alert, oriented, and bright."
