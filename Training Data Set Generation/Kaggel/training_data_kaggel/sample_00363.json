  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Urinary hesitancy and weak stream. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urinary hesitancy and weak stream. 2. Urethral narrowing. 3. Mild posterior wall erythema. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Urethral dilation. 3. Bladder biopsy and fulguration. ANESTHESIA: General. SPECIMEN: Urine culture sensitivity and cytology and bladder biopsy x1. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. INDICATIONS AND FINDINGS: This is a 76-year-old female with history of weak stream and history of intermittent catheterization secondary to hypotonic bladder in the past, last cystoscopy approximately two years ago. FINDINGS AT TIME OF SURGERY: Cystourethroscopy revealed some mild narrowing of the urethra, which was easily dilated to #23 French. A midureteral polyp was noted. Cystoscopy revealed multiple cellules and mild trabeculation of the bladder. Posterior wall revealed some mild erythema with some distorted architecture of the bladder mucosa. No obvious raised bladder tumor was noted. No foreign bodies were noted. The ureteral orifices were noted on the trigone just proximal to the bladder neck. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room, general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia. The patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion and urethral sounds used to dilate the urethra to accommodate #23 French cystoscope. Cystoscopy was performed in its entirety with the above findings. The small area of erythema on the posterior wall was biopsied using a flexible biopsy forceps and Bovie cautery was used to cauterize and fulgurate this area. The bladder was drained, cystoscope was removed, scope was reinserted and bladder was again reexamined. No evidence of active bleeding noted. The bladder was drained, cystoscope was removed, and the patient was cleaned and sent to recovery room in stable condition to followup with Dr. X in two weeks. She is given prescription for Levaquin and Pyridium and given discharge instructions.",

Narrowing of the urethra.  \n3. Mild redness on the back wall of the bladder.  \n\n**Procedure performed:**  \n1. Cystourethroscopy (looking inside the bladder and urethra).  \n2. Dilation of the urethra.  \n3. Biopsy of the bladder wall and cauterization (burning) of the tissue.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia.  \n\n**Specimen sent for lab:** Urine culture, urine cytology, and one bladder biopsy.  \n\n**Disposition:** Patient went to the post‑anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.  \n\n**Indications and findings:**  \nA 76‑year‑old woman who has had a weak stream and has used intermittent catheterization because her bladder was not contracting well. Her last cystoscopy was about two years ago.  \n\nDuring the surgery, the cystoscope showed a mild narrowing of the urethra, which was easily widened to a #23 French size. A small polyp was seen in the middle of the urethra. The bladder had some mild thickening and a few small cells, but no obvious tumors. The back wall of the bladder had mild redness and a slightly distorted lining. No foreign objects were found. The openings of the ureters were seen near the bladder neck.  \n\n**Procedure description:**  \nAfter the patient gave consent, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia. She was cleaned and covered in a sterile manner. A sound was used to widen the urethra enough for a #23 French cystoscope. The cystoscope was passed through the urethra and into the bladder, and the findings above were confirmed. The small red area on the back wall of the bladder was biopsied with a flexible forceps, and the tissue was cauterized with a Bovie device. The bladder was drained, the scope was removed, then reinserted to check again. No active bleeding was seen. The bladder was drained again, the scope was removed, and the patient was cleaned and sent to recovery in stable condition. She will see Dr. X in two weeks. She was given prescriptions for Levaquin and Pyridium and received discharge instructions."
