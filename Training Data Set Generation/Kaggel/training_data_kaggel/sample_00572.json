  "medical": "CC: Paraplegia. HX: This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time. On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb. She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with &quot;pins & needles&quot; sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g. On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal&lt;1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued. On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These titers were not known when she initially arrived at UIHC. Following administration of Praziquantel, she regained some sensation in BLE but the paraplegia, and urinary retention remained. MEDS: On 5/24/97 UIHC arrival: Prednisone 60mg qd, Zantac 50 IV qd, Propulsid 20mg tid, Enoxaparin 20mg qd. PMH: 1)G4P4. FHX: unremarkable. SHX: Missionary. Married. 4 children ( ages 7,5,3,6 weeks). EXAM: BP110/70, HR72, RR16, 35.6C MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Lucid thought process. CN: unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE strength. Lower extremities: 1/1 quads and hamstrings, 0/0 distally. Sensory: Decreased PP/LT/VIB from feet to inguinal regions, bilaterally. T12 sensory level to temperature (ice glove). Coord: normal FNF. Station/Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE. 0/0 BLE. No plantar responses, bilaterally. Rectal: decreased to no rectal tone. Guaiac negative. Other: No Lhermitte's sign. No paraspinal hypertonicity noted. No vertebral tenderness. Gen exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: MRI T-L-spine, 5/24/97, revealed a 6 x 8 x 25 soft tissue mass at the L1 level posterior to the tip of the conus medullaris and extending into the canal below that level. This appeared to be intradural. There was mild enhancement. There was more enhancement along the distal cord surface and cauda equina. The distal cord had sign of diffuse edema. She underwent exploratory and decompressive laminectomy on 5/27/97, and was retreated with a one day course of Praziquantel 40mg/kg/day. Praziquantel is reportedly only 80% effective at parasite eradication. She continued to reside on the Neurology/Neurosurgical service on 5/31/97 and remained paraplegic.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: Paraplegia.  \nHistory: A 32‑year‑old right‑handed woman who had been doing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years delivered her fourth baby by vaginal delivery on April 10, 1997. The delivery was induced with Pitocin but otherwise uncomplicated. For the first four days after birth she had clear watery diarrhea without blood and mild abdominal discomfort that resolved on its own. In the second week after delivery she had 4–5 days of sinusitis, thick nasal discharge, and facial pain. She was otherwise well until May 4, 1997, when she was in a more rural area of Nigeria. She felt a dull ache in both knees (outside the kneecaps) and the upper part of her shin bones on both sides. Massage did not help and the pain was worse when she was sitting or lying down. She had no loss of feeling at that time.  \n\nOn May 6, 1997 she woke up with pain that spread from her knees down to the front of her shins. Over the next few hours the pain went around both calves, involved the soles of her feet and the back of her lower legs up to her buttocks. Getting out of bed was hard and she needed help to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen helped only a little. By the evening one foot’s sole was numb. She woke the next morning, May 9, 1997, with a “pins and needles” feeling in both lower limbs up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for pain and flew back to the larger city where she was based. During the one‑hour flight her weakness in both lower limbs progressed to the point that she could not stand. Local evaluation showed 3/3 strength in the thighs and 4/4 in the lower legs. She had a sensory level at her waist on pin‑prick and light‑touch testing. She also had mild lower back pain. Local labs: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was thought to have Guillain‑Barré syndrome and was started on Solu‑Cortef 1000 mg once daily and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g.  \n\nOn May 10, 1997 she was air‑lifted to Geneva, Switzerland. When she arrived she had complete loss of feeling from the feet up to the groin, on both sides. There was flaccid, areflexic paralysis of both lower limbs and she could not urinate or defecate. A straight catheter showed a residual bladder volume of 1000 cc.  \n\nOn May 12, CSF analysis showed protein 1.5 g/L, glucose 2.2 mmol/L, WBC 92 (all lymphocytes), RBC 70, clear fluid, cultures negative. Broad‑spectrum antibiotics and Solu‑Medrol 1 g IV daily were started. MRI of the thoracolumbar spine on May 12 showed an intradural lesion at T12‑L1 that enhanced slightly with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord swelling. Brain MRI was normal and showed no demyelinating disease. Tests for HIV, HTLV‑1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, malaria and CMV were negative.  \n\nOn May 15 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serology was positive at 1:320 (normal <1:80). CSF Schistosomiasis tests on May 12 were negative. She was given a one‑day course of Praziquantel 3.6 g total in three doses and started on Prednisone 60 mg daily; the antibiotics and Solu‑Medrol were stopped.  \n\nOn May 22 a rectal biopsy was done to check for parasites. It was positive for ova and granulomas after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. CSF Schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers on May 22 were 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These titers were not known when she first arrived at UIHC. After Praziquantel she regained some feeling in her lower limbs but remained paraplegic and could not urinate.  \n\nMedications on May 24 at UIHC: Prednisone 60 mg daily, Zantac 50 mg IV daily, Propulsid 20 mg three times daily, Enoxaparin 20 mg daily.  \n\nPast medical history: G4P4. Family history: unremarkable. Social history: missionary, married, four children (ages 7, 5, 3, 6 weeks).  \n\nExamination on May 24: BP 110/70, HR 72, RR 16, temperature 35.6 °C. Alert and oriented. Speech normal. Cranial nerves normal. Motor: 5/5 strength in both upper limbs. Lower limbs: 1/1 in quadriceps and hamstrings, 0/0 distally. Sensory: decreased pin‑prick, light touch, vibration from feet to groin bilaterally. T12 sensory level to temperature. Coordination normal. Reflexes: 2/2 in upper limbs, 0/0 in lower limbs. No plantar responses. Rectal tone decreased to none. No Lhermitte’s sign. No back muscle tightness or vertebral tenderness. Genital exam normal.  \n\nCourse: MRI on May 24 showed a 6 × 8 × 25 mm soft‑tissue mass at L1 behind the tip of the conus medullaris and extending below. It appeared intradural, mildly enhancing, with more enhancement along the distal cord and cauda equina. The distal cord had diffuse edema. She had an exploratory and decompressive laminectomy on May 27 and was given another one‑day course of Praziquantel 40 mg/kg/day. Praziquantel is only about 80 % effective at eradicating parasites. She remained on the neurology/neurosurgery service on May 31 and was still paraplegic."
