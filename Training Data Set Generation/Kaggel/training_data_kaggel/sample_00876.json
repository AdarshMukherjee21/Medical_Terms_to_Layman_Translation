POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical myelopathy secondary to very large disc herniations at C4-C5 and C5-C6. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Anterior cervical discectomy, C4-C5 and C5-C6. 2. Arthrodesis, C4-C5 and C5-C6. 3. Partial corpectomy, C5. 4. Machine bone allograft, C4-C5 and C5-C6. 5. Placement of anterior cervical plate with a Zephyr C4 to C6. 6. Fluoroscopic guidance. 7. Microscopic dissection. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 60 mL. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS: This is a patient who presents with progressive weakness in the left upper extremity as well as imbalance. He has also noted to have cord signal at the C4-C5 level secondary to a very large disc herniation that came behind the body at C5 as well and as well as a large disc herniation at C5-C6. Risks and benefits of the surgery including bleeding, infection, neurologic deficit, nonunion, progressive spondylosis, and lack of improvement were all discussed. He understood and wished to proceed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. Preoperative antibiotics were given. The patient was placed in the supine position with all pressure points noted and well padded. The patient was prepped and draped in standard fashion. An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid. Blunt dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and trachea and esophagus moved medially. We then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found to be at C5-C6. Distracting pins were placed in the body of C4 and in to the body of C6. The disc was then completely removed at C4-C5. There was very significant compression of the cord. This was carefully removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord. This was very severe and multiple free fragments were noted. This was taken down to the level of ligamentum. Both foramen were then also opened. Other free fragments were also found behind the body of C5, part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all of these were removed. The exact same procedure was done at C5-C6; however, if there were again free fragments noted, there was less not as severe compression at the C4-C5 area. Again part of the body at C5 was removed to make sure that there was no additional constriction. Both nerve roots were then widely decompressed. Machine bone allograft was placed into the C4-C5 as well as C5-C6 and then a Zephyr plate was placed in the body of C4 and to the body of C6 with a metal pin placed into the body at C5. Excellent purchase was obtained. Fluoroscopy showed good placement and meticulous hemostasis was obtained. Fascia was closed with 3-0 Vicryl, subcuticular 3-0 Dermabond for skin. The patient tolerated the procedure well and went to recovery in good condition.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The patient had cervical myelopathy caused by very large herniated discs at the C4‑C5 and C5‑C6 levels of the neck.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The same condition after surgery.  \n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:  \n1. Removed the discs at C4‑C5 and C5‑C6 from the front of the spine.  \n2. Joined the C4‑C5 and C5‑C6 vertebrae together (fusion).  \n3. Removed part of the C5 vertebra (partial corpectomy).  \n4. Placed a bone graft from a donor into the C4‑C5 and C5‑C6 spaces.  \n5. Attached an anterior cervical plate (Zephyr) from C4 to C6.  \n6. Used fluoroscopy (real‑time X‑ray) to guide the work.  \n7. Used a microscope for precise dissection.  \n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia.  \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 60 mL.  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \n\nINDICATIONS: The patient had worsening weakness in his left arm and trouble keeping his balance. Imaging showed a very large disc herniation at C4‑C5 that pushed behind the C5 vertebra, and another large herniation at C5‑C6. The risks (bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, worsening spine disease, and no improvement) and benefits of the surgery were explained. The patient understood and chose to proceed.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. Antibiotics were given before surgery. The patient was positioned so all pressure points were padded. The surgical area was cleaned and covered. An incision was made just above the cricoid cartilage. The surgeon gently separated tissues to expose the front of the spine, moving the carotid artery to the side and the trachea and esophagus toward the middle. A needle was placed into the disc spaces to confirm the C5‑C6 level. Pins were inserted into the bodies of C4 and C6 to help keep the spine straight. The disc at C4‑C5 was completely removed, relieving severe pressure on the spinal cord. Many free fragments were found and removed carefully to avoid harming the cord. The removal went down to the ligament. Both nerve root openings were also opened. More free fragments were found behind the C5 body; part of the C5 body was removed to ensure all fragments were cleared. The same steps were repeated at C5‑C6, with fewer fragments than at C4‑C5. Part of the C5 body was removed again to avoid any extra pressure. Both nerve roots were fully decompressed. A donor bone graft was placed into the C4‑C5 and C5‑C6 spaces, and a Zephyr plate was secured from C4 to C6 with a metal pin into the C5 body. The plate fit well. Fluoroscopy confirmed proper placement and the surgeon stopped all bleeding. The fascia was closed with 3‑0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was closed with 3‑0 Dermabond. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was sent to recovery in good condition."
