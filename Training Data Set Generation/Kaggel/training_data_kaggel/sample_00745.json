  "medical": "DIAGNOSIS: Possible cerebrovascular accident. DESCRIPTION: The EEG was obtained using 21 electrodes placed in scalp-to-scalp and scalp-to-vertex montages. The background activity appears to consist of fairly organized somewhat pleomorphic low to occasional medium amplitude of 7-8 cycle per second activity and was seen mostly posteriorly bilaterally symmetrically. A large amount of movement artifacts and electromyographic effects were noted intermixed throughout the recording session. Transient periods of drowsiness occurred naturally producing irregular 5-7 cycle per second activity mostly over the anterior regions. Hyperventilation was not performed. No epileptiform activity or any definite lateralizing findings were seen. IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal study. The findings are suggestive of a generalized cerebral disorder. Due to the abundant amount of movement artifacts, any lateralizing findings, if any cannot be well appreciated. Clinical correlation is recommended.",
  "layman": "DIAGNOSIS: Possible stroke.  \nDESCRIPTION: An EEG test was done with 21 electrodes on the scalp. The brain activity looked fairly organized, mostly low to medium in strength, with a rhythm of about 7‑8 cycles per second. This pattern was seen mainly on the back of the head on both sides. There were a lot of movement and muscle noise throughout the test. Short periods of natural drowsiness caused irregular activity of 5‑7 cycles per second, mainly at the front of the head. We did not use hyperventilation. No clear signs of seizures or obvious side‑to‑side differences were found.  \nIMPRESSION: The study is slightly abnormal. The results suggest a general brain problem. Because of the many movement artifacts, it is hard to see any side‑specific findings. A clinical review is recommended."
