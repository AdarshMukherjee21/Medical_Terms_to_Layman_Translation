  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: Left arm and hand numbness. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained with 5 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: There is an approximately 5-mm shift of the midline towards the right side. Significant low attenuation is seen throughout the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. There is loss of the cortical sulci on the right side. These findings are compatible with edema. Within the right parietal lobe, a 1.8 cm, rounded, hyperintense mass is seen. No hydrocephalus is evident. The calvarium is intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: A 5 mm midline shift to the left side secondary to severe edema of the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. A 1.8 cm high attenuation mass in the right parietal lobe is concerning for hemorrhage given its high density. A postcontrast MRI is required for further characterization of this mass. Gradient echo imaging should be obtained.",

The white‑matter areas of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes show a large drop in density, indicating swelling. The brain folds (sulci) on the right side are less visible. In the right parietal lobe, there is a round, bright spot about 1.8 cm in size. The brain’s fluid spaces are normal, and the skull is intact. The sinuses look clear.  \n\nIMPRESSION: The 5‑mm shift of the brain’s center line is caused by severe swelling in the right front, middle, and back white‑matter areas. The 1.8‑cm bright spot in the right parietal lobe looks like a bleed because it is very dense. A contrast MRI is needed to look at this spot more closely, and a special echo scan should also be done."
