  "medical": "CC: Confusion. HX: A 71 y/o RHM ,with a history of two strokes ( one in 11/90 and one in 11/91), had been in a stable state of health until 12/31/92 when he became confused, and displayed left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. The symptoms resolved within hours and recurred the following day. He was then evaluated locally and HCT revealed an old right parietal stroke. Carotid duplex scan revealed a &quot;high grade stenosis&quot; of the RICA. Cerebral Angiogram revealed 90%RICA and 50%LICA stenosis. He was then transferred to UIHC Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy. His confusion persisted and he was evaluated by Neurology on 1/8/93 and transferred to Neurology on 1/11/93. PMH: 1)cholecystectomy. 2)inguinal herniorrhaphies, bilaterally. 3)ETOH abuse: 3-10 beers/day. 4)Right parietal stroke 10/87 with residual left hemiparesis (Leg worse than arm). 5) 2nd stoke in distant past of unspecified type. MEDS: None on admission. FHX: Alzheimer's disease and stroke on paternal side of family. SHX: 50+pack-yr cigarette use. ROS: no weight loss. poor appetite/selective eater. EXAM: BP137/70 HR81 RR13 O2Sat 95% Afebrile. MS: Oriented to city and month, but did not know date or hospital. Naming and verbal comprehension were intact. He could tell which direction Iowa City and Des Moines were from Clinton and remembered 2-3 objects in two minutes, but both with assistance only. Incorrectly spelled &quot;world&quot; backward, as &quot;dlow.&quot; CN: unremarkable except neglects left visual field to double simultaneous stimulation. Motor: Deltoids 4+/4-, biceps 5-/4, triceps 5/4+, grip 4+/4+, HF4+/4-, HE 4+/4+, Hamstrings 5-/5-, AE 5-/5-, AF 5-/5-. Sensory: intact PP/LT/Vib. Coord: dysdiadochokinesis on RAM, bilaterally. Station: dyssynergic RUE on FNF movement. Gait: ND Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout BUE and at patellae. Absent at ankles. Right plantar was flexor; and Left plantar was equivocal. COURSE: CBC revealed normal Hgb, Hct, Plt and WBC, but Mean corpuscular volume was large at 103FL (normal 82-98). Urinalysis revealed 20+WBC. GS, TSH, FT4, VDRL, ANA and RF were unremarkable. He was treated for a UTI with amoxacillin. Vitamin B12 level was reduced at 139pg/ml (normal 232-1137). Schillings test was inconclusive dure to inability to complete a 24-hour urine collection. He was placed on empiric Vitamin B12 1000mcg IM qd x 7 days; then qMonth. He was also placed on Thiamine 100mg qd, Folate 1mg qd, and ASA 325mg qd. His ESR and CRP were elevated on admission, but fell as his UTI was treated. EEG showed diffuse slowing and focal slowing in the theta-delta range in the right temporal area. HCT with contrast on 1/19/93 revealed a gyriform enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe consistent with a new infarct; and an old right parietal hypodensity (infarct). His confusion was ascribed to the UTI in the face of old and new strokes and Vitamin B12 deficiency. He was lost to follow-up and did not undergo carotid endarterectomy.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: confusion.  \nHistory: A 71‑year‑old man who had two strokes (November 1990 and November 1991) was doing well until December 31, 1992, when he suddenly became confused, had weakness on the left side of his body, and had trouble speaking. The symptoms went away after a few hours but returned the next day. He was examined locally and a head CT showed an old stroke in the right parietal area. A carotid duplex scan found a severe narrowing of the right internal carotid artery. A cerebral angiogram confirmed 90 % narrowing of the right internal carotid and 50 % narrowing of the left internal carotid. He was sent to UIHC Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy. His confusion did not improve, so he was seen by neurology on January 8, 1993 and transferred to the neurology service on January 11, 1993.\n\nPast medical history: cholecystectomy, bilateral inguinal hernia repairs, chronic alcohol use (3–10 beers per day), a right parietal stroke in October 1987 with lasting left‑side weakness (leg worse than arm), and a second stroke of unknown type. He was not on any medications when admitted.  \nFamily history: Alzheimer’s disease and stroke on the father’s side.  \nSocial history: smoked more than 50 pack‑years.  \nReview of systems: no weight loss, poor appetite, selective eating.\n\nPhysical exam: blood pressure 137/70, heart rate 81, respiratory rate 13, oxygen saturation 95 %, no fever. He was oriented to city and month but did not know the date or the hospital name. He could name and understand words, could point out the direction of Iowa City and Des Moines from Clinton, and remembered 2–3 objects in two minutes with help. He spelled “world” backward incorrectly as “dlow.” Neurologic exam: normal except he ignored the left side of his vision when both eyes were stimulated. Muscle strength: right arm 4+/4‑, biceps 5‑/4, triceps 5/4+, grip 4+/4+, hand 4+/4‑, head/neck 4+/4+, hamstrings 5‑/5‑, ankle extensors 5‑/5‑, ankle flexors 5‑/5‑. Sensation normal. Coordination: trouble with rapid alternating movements in both hands. Standing: difficulty moving right arm and hand together. Gait: normal. Reflexes 2+/2+ in all upper limbs and at the knees, absent at ankles. Right foot plantar reflex flexor, left equivocal.\n\nCourse: Blood count normal, but mean corpuscular volume high at 103 fL. Urine had many white blood cells. Blood tests for glucose, TSH, free T4, VDRL, ANA, RF were normal. He was treated for a urinary tract infection with amoxicillin. Vitamin B12 was low at 139 pg/mL. A Schilling test was inconclusive because he couldn’t finish a 24‑hour urine collection. He received intramuscular vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily for 7 days, then monthly. He also received thiamine 100 mg daily, folate 1 mg daily, and aspirin 325 mg daily. Inflammatory markers ESR and CRP were high on admission but fell after the UTI was treated. An EEG showed general slowing and focal slowing in the right temporal area. A contrast head CT on January 19, 1993 showed a new small stroke in the left parietal lobe and the old right parietal stroke. His confusion was thought to be caused by the UTI, the old and new strokes, and low vitamin B12. He was lost to follow‑up and did not have the carotid surgery."
