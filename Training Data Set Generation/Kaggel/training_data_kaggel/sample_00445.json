  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year old male with a Gleason score 8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving the left and right lobes. He has a PSA of 3.1, with a prostate gland size of 41 grams. This was initially found on rectal examination with a nodule on the right side of the prostate, showing enlargement relative to the left. He has undergone evaluation with a bone scan that showed a right parietal lesion uptake and was seen by Dr. XXX and ultimately underwent an open biopsy that was not malignant. Prior to this, he has also had a ProstaScint scan that was negative for any metastatic disease. Again, he is being admitted to undergo a radical prostatectomy, the risks, benefits, and alternatives of which have been discussed, including that of bleeding, and a blood transfusion. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary stenting. History of high blood pressure, as well. He has erectile dysfunction and has been treated with Viagra. MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Aspirin, Zocor, and Prilosec. ALLERGIES: Penicillin. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is not a smoker. He does drink six beers a day. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Remarkable for his high blood pressure and drug allergies, but otherwise unremarkable, except for some obstructive urinary symptoms, with an AUA score of 19. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: HEENT: Examination unremarkable. Breasts: Examination deferred. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. He has no hernias. Genitourinary: There is a normal-appearing phallus, prominence of the right side of prostate. Extremities: Examination unremarkable. Neurologic: Examination nonfocal. IMPRESSION: 1. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 2. Erectile dysfunction. PLAN: The patient will undergo a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of this have been discussed. He understands and asks that I proceed ahead. We also discussed bleeding and blood transfusions, and the risks, benefits and alternatives thereof.",
