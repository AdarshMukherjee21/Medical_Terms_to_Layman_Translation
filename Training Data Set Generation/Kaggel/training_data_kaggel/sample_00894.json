  "medical": "The patient was sedated with intravenous fentanyl 75 mcg and intravenous Versed, 5 mg, both titrated over the first ten minutes of the procedure time to achieve adequate sedation for the procedure. Cetacaine spray was applied to the hypopharynx for local anesthesia. The upper endoscope was passed, without difficulty, into the upper GI tract. The anatomy and mucosa of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, stomach, pylorus, and small bowel were all carefully inspected. All structures were visually normal in appearance. Biopsies of the distal duodenum, gastric antrum, and distal esophagus were taken and sent for pathological evaluation. The endoscope and insufflated air were slowly removed from the upper GI tract. A repeat look at the structures involved again showed no visible abnormalities, except for the biopsy sites. The patient tolerated the procedure with excellent comfort and stable vital signs. After a recovery period in the Endoscopy Suite, the patient is discharged to continue recovering in the family's care at home. The family knows to follow up with me today if there are concerns about the patient's recovery from the procedure. They will follow up with me later this week for biopsy and CLO test results so that appropriate further diagnostic and therapeutic plans can be made.",
  "layman": "The patient was given a sedative (fentanyl 75 mcg) and a muscle relaxant (Versed 5 mg) through a vein. The doses were increased over the first ten minutes so the patient was calm enough for the procedure. A spray of Cetacaine was used to numb the back of the throat. The upper endoscope was inserted easily into the upper digestive tract. The doctor looked closely at the esophagus, the junction where the esophagus meets the stomach, the stomach itself, the pylorus, and the beginning of the small intestine. Everything looked normal. Tissue samples were taken from the lower part of the small intestine, the lower stomach, and the lower esophagus and sent to the lab for analysis. The scope and the air that had been used to expand the stomach were removed slowly. A second look at the same areas showed no new problems, except at the biopsy sites. The patient stayed comfortable and her vital signs stayed stable. After a short recovery in the Endoscopy Suite, she was sent home to continue recovering with her family. The family was told to contact me today if they have any concerns about her recovery. They will also come back later this week to get the biopsy and CLO test results so we can decide on any further treatment."
