  "medical": "CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Generalized abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and recent colonic resection in 11/08. TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the abdomen were obtained without contrast. Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were then obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300. FINDINGS: The liver is normal in size and attenuation. The gallbladder is normal. The spleen is normal in size and attenuation. The adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable. The kidneys are normal in size and attenuation. No hydronephrosis is detected. Free fluid is seen within the right upper quadrant within the lower pelvis. A markedly thickened loop of distal small bowel is seen. This segment measures at least 10-cm long. No definite pneumatosis is appreciated. No free air is apparent at this time. Inflammatory changes around this loop of bowel. Mild distention of adjacent small bowel loops measuring up to 3.5 cm is evident. No complete obstruction is suspected, as there is contrast material within the colon. Postsurgical changes compatible with the partial colectomy are noted. Postsurgical changes of the anterior abdominal wall are seen. Mild thickening of the urinary bladder wall is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Marked thickening of a segment of distal small bowel is seen with free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis. An inflammatory process such as infection or ischemia must be considered. Close interval followup is necessary. 2. Thickening of the urinary bladder wall is nonspecific and may be due to under distention. However, evaluation for cystitis is advised.",
  "layman": "CT scan of the abdomen (with and without contrast) and CT scan of the pelvis (with contrast)\n\n**Reason for the exam:**  \nYou have widespread belly pain, nausea, diarrhea, and you had part of your colon removed on 11/08.\n\n**Technique:**  \nFirst, we took CT images of the abdomen without any dye. Then we took more images of the abdomen and pelvis after giving you 100 mL of a contrast dye called Isovue‑300.\n\n**Findings:**  \n- The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, and kidneys all look normal.  \n- The kidneys are the right size and shape, and there is no swelling of the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys.  \n- There is fluid in the upper right part of the belly and in the lower pelvis.  \n- A long section (at least 10 cm) of the small intestine near the end of the small bowel is very thickened.  \n- We do not see any obvious gas bubbles in the bowel wall or free air in the belly.  \n- The area around this thickened bowel shows signs of inflammation.  \n- Nearby small bowel loops are a little enlarged, up to 3.5 cm.  \n- There is no complete blockage, because contrast is still moving into the colon.  \n- The changes after your partial colon removal are visible.  \n- The front abdominal wall also shows post‑surgery changes.  \n- The wall of the bladder is slightly thickened.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. A long, thickened part of the small intestine with fluid in the belly and pelvis. This could be due to infection or reduced blood flow. A repeat scan soon is needed.  \n2. The bladder wall is a bit thick; this might just be because it wasn’t fully stretched. Still, checking for bladder inflammation (cystitis) is recommended."
