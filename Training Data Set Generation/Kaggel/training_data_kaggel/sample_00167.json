  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dysphagia and globus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal. MEDICATIONS: MAC. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus and stomach, and then through the gastrojejunal anastomosis into the efferent jejunal loop. The preparation was good and all surfaces were well seen. The hypopharynx was normal with no evidence of inflammation. The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout with no sign of stricturing or inflammation or exudate. The GE junction was located at 39 cm from the incisors and appeared normal with no evidence of reflux, damage, or Barrett's. Below this there was a small gastric pouch measuring 6 cm with intact mucosa and no retained food. The gastrojejunal anastomosis was patent measuring about 12 mm, with no inflammation or ulceration. Beyond this there was a side-to-side gastrojejunal anastomosis with a short afferent blind end and a normal efferent end with no sign of obstruction or inflammation. The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room. She tolerated the procedure well. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal post-gastric bypass anatomy. 2. No evidence of inflammation or narrowing to explain her symptoms.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Gastroscopy (a scope is passed into the throat, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine).  \n\n**Before the procedure:** The patient had trouble swallowing and a feeling of a lump in the throat.  \n\n**After the procedure:** Everything looked normal.  \n\n**Medication used:** MAC (a type of anesthesia).  \n\n**What was seen during the scope:**  \n- The scope was gently passed through the mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach, then through the surgical connection (gastrojejunal anastomosis) into the part of the small intestine that carries food away (efferent jejunal loop).  \n- The view was clear and all areas were visible.  \n- The upper throat (hypopharynx) looked normal with no swelling.  \n- The esophagus had a normal shape and lining, with no narrowing, swelling, or discharge.  \n- The junction where the esophagus meets the stomach (GE junction) was at 39 cm from the front teeth and looked normal—no signs of acid damage or Barrett’s disease.  \n- Below that, a small stomach pouch (about 6 cm) had a healthy lining and no leftover food.  \n- The surgical connection (gastrojejunal anastomosis) was open, about 12 mm wide, with no swelling or ulcers.  \n- Beyond that, a side‑to‑side connection had a short blind end on the side that receives food and a normal open end that lets food pass, with no blockage or swelling.  \n- The scope was removed and the patient was sent to recovery. She tolerated the procedure well.  \n\n**Final diagnoses:**  \n1. Normal anatomy after gastric bypass.  \n2. No swelling or narrowing that could explain her swallowing problems."
