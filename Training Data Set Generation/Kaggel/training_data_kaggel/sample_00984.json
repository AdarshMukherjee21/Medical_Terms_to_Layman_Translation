  "medical": "CC: Falling to left. HX: 26y/oRHF fell and struck her head on the ice 3.5 weeks prior to presentation. There was no associated loss of consciousness. She noted a dull headache and severe sharp pain behind her left ear 8 days ago. The pain lasted 1-2 minutes in duration. The next morning she experienced difficulty walking and consistently fell to the left. In addition the left side of her face had become numb and she began choking on food. Family noted her pupils had become unequal in size. She was seen locally and felt to be depressed and admitted to a psychiatric facility. She was subsequently transferred to UIHC following evaluation by a local ophthalmologist. MEDS: Prozac and Ativan (both recently started at the psychiatric facility). PMH: 1) Right esotropia and hyperopia since age 1year. 2) Recurrent UTI. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Divorced. Lives with children. No spontaneous abortions. Denied ETOH/Tobacco/Illicit Drug use. EXAM: BP 138/110. HR 85. RR 16. Temp 37.2C. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Intact naming, comprehension, repetition. CN: Pupils 4/2 decreasing to 3/1 on exposure to light. Optic Disks flat. VFFTC. Esotropia OD, otherwise EOM full. Horizontal nystagmus on leftward gaze. Decreased corneal reflex, OS. Decreased PP/TEMP sensation on left side of face. Light touch testing normal. Decreased gag response on left. Uvula deviates to right. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: Decreased PP and TEMP on right side of body. PROP/VIB intact. Coord: Difficulty with FNF/HKS/RAM on left. Normal on right side. Station: No pronator drift. Romberg test not noted. Gait: unsteady with tendency to fall to left. Reflexes: 3/3 throughout BUE and Patellae. 2+/2+ Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: Obese. In no acute distress. Otherwise unremarkable. HEENT: No carotid/vertebral/cranial bruits. COURSE: PT/PTT, GS, CBC, TSH, FT4 and Cholesterol screen were all within normal limits. HCT on admission was negative. MRI Brain (done locally 2/2/93) was reviewed and a left lateral medullary stroke was appreciated. The patient underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/3/93 which revealed significant narrowing of the left vertebral artery beginning at C2 and extending to and involving the basilar artery. There is severe, irregular narrowing of the horizontal portion above the posterior arch of C1. The findings were felt consistent with a left vertebral artery dissection. Neuro-opthalmology confirmed a left Horner's pupil by clinical exam and history. Cookie swallow study was unremarkable. The Patient was placed on Heparin then converted to Coumadin. The PT on discharge was 17. She remained on Coumadin for 3 months and then was switched to ASA for 1 year. An Otolaryngologic evaluation on 10/96 noted true left vocal cord paralysis with full glottic closure. A prosthesis was made and no surgical invention was done.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: Fell to the left side.  \nHistory: A 26‑year‑old woman fell and hit her head on ice about 3½ weeks ago. She did not lose consciousness. She began having a dull headache and a very sharp pain behind her left ear 8 days ago. The pain lasted 1–2 minutes. The next morning she had trouble walking and kept falling to the left. Her left face became numb and she started choking on food. Her family noticed her pupils were different sizes. She was seen at a local clinic, appeared depressed, and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. She was then transferred to UIHC after a local eye doctor examined her.  \nMedications: Prozac and Ativan, both started recently at the psychiatric hospital.  \nPast medical history: 1) Right eye turned inward (esotropia) and farsightedness (hyperopia) since age 1. 2) Recurrent urinary tract infections.  \nFamily history: Unremarkable.  \nSocial history: Divorced, lives with children, no spontaneous abortions, does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs.  \n\nPhysical exam:  \n- Blood pressure 138/110, heart rate 85, breathing 16, temperature 37.2 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, time.  \n- Speech normal, can name, understand, and repeat words.  \n- Eye exam: pupils 4 mm and 2 mm, getting smaller with light (4/2 → 3/1). Optic discs look normal. Vision is fine. Right eye turns inward; eye movements are otherwise normal. When looking left, she has horizontal nystagmus.  \n- Left eye has a weaker corneal reflex.  \n- Left side of face has reduced pain and temperature sensation. Light touch is normal.  \n- Left side has a weaker gag reflex. Uvula tilts to the right. Other cranial nerves are normal.  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 everywhere, normal bulk and tone.  \n- Right side of body has reduced pain and temperature sensation. Touch and vibration are normal.  \n- Coordination: trouble with finger‑to‑nose, heel‑to‑shin, and rapid alternating movements on the left; right side is fine. No pronator drift. Romberg not noted.  \n- Gait: unsteady, tends to fall to the left.  \n- Reflexes 3/3 in all upper extremities and knees; 2+/2+ in ankles. Plantar responses flexor on both sides.  \n- General: obese, no acute distress. Head, ears, nose, throat normal; no bruits.  \n\nCourse:  \n- Blood tests (PT/PTT, glucose, CBC, TSH, FT4, cholesterol) all normal. HCT on admission negative.  \n- MRI of the brain (done locally on 2/2/93) showed a left lateral medullary stroke.  \n- Cerebral angiogram on 2/3/93 showed a significant narrowing of the left vertebral artery starting at C2 and extending into the basilar artery, with severe irregular narrowing above the posterior arch of C1. This was consistent with a left vertebral artery dissection.  \n- Neuro‑ophthalmology confirmed a left Horner’s pupil by exam and history.  \n- Swallow study was normal.  \n- She was started on heparin and then switched to coumadin. PT on discharge was 17. She stayed on coumadin for 3 months, then switched to aspirin for 1 year.  \n- An ENT evaluation on 10/96 found true left vocal cord paralysis with full closure of the vocal cords.
