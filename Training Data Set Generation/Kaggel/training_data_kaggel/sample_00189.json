  "medical": "The patient was placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. Circumferential proximal incisions were made on the foreskin and dissected down to the underlying tissue. Hemostasis was obtained with a needlepoint Bovie. The foreskin was dissected sharply off of the shaft of the penis. Hemostasis controlled. The proximal and distal penile coronal skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut in interrupted fashion. 0.25% Marcaine was used around the base of the penis for a pain block postoperatively and Vaseline soaked gauze wrapped around the penis loosely as a dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "The patient was laid flat on their back, cleaned, and covered in the usual way. The surgeon made circular cuts around the foreskin and cut down to the tissue underneath. Bleeding was stopped with a needlepoint cautery device. The foreskin was then sharply cut away from the shaft of the penis, and any bleeding was controlled. The skin at the top and bottom of the penis was sewn back together with 4‑0 chromic catgut stitches in an interrupted pattern. A 0.25% Marcaine injection was given around the base of the penis for pain relief after the surgery, and a piece of gauze soaked in Vaseline was loosely wrapped around the penis as a dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition."
