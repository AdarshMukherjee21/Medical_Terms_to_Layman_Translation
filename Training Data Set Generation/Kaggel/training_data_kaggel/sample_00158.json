  "medical": "EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous contrast. CLINICAL INDICATION: Left lower quadrant abdominal pain. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without and with intravenous contrast. Total of 100 mL of Isovue was administered intravenously. Oral contrast was also administered. The lung bases are clear. The liver is enlarged and decreased in attenuation. There are no focal liver masses. There is no intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is slightly distended. The adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney are normal. A 12-mm simple cyst is present in the inferior pole of the right kidney. There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The appendix is normal. There are multiple diverticula in the rectosigmoid. There is evidence of focal wall thickening in the sigmoid colon (image #69) with adjacent fat stranding in association with a diverticulum. These findings are consistent with diverticulitis. No pneumoperitoneum is identified. There is no ascites or focal fluid collection. The aorta is normal in contour and caliber. There is no adenopathy. Degenerative changes are present in the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with diverticulitis. Please see report above.",
  "layman": "EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, first without and then with a contrast injection.  \nCLINICAL INDICATION: Pain in the lower left side of the belly.  \nCOMPARISON: None.  \n\nFINDINGS: The scan was done twice, once without contrast and once with 100 mL of Isovue injected into a vein. Oral contrast was also taken. The lower parts of the lungs look normal. The liver is a bit larger than usual and looks a little darker on the scan. There are no lumps in the liver and no swelling of the bile ducts inside or outside the liver. The gallbladder is a little swollen. The adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney all look normal. The right kidney has a 12‑mm simple cyst in its lower part. The kidneys and tubes that drain urine are not swollen. The appendix looks normal. The rectosigmoid colon (the part of the colon near the rectum) has many small pouches (diverticula). One of these pouches in the sigmoid colon shows a thickened wall and nearby fat that looks inflamed (image #69). These changes match diverticulitis. There is no free air in the abdomen, no fluid buildup, and no abnormal swelling of lymph nodes. The aorta looks normal. The lower back spine shows wear and tear.  \n\nIMPRESSION: The scan shows diverticulitis."
