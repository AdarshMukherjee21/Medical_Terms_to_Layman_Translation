  "medical": "CC: Difficulty with speech. HX: This 72 y/o RHM awoke early on 8/14/95 to prepare to play golf. He felt fine. However, at 6:00AM, on 8/14/95, he began speaking abnormally. His wife described his speech as &quot;word salad&quot; and &quot;complete gibberish.&quot; She immediately took him to a local hospital . Enroute, he was initially able to understand what was spoken to him. By the time he arrived at the hospital at 6:45AM, he was unable to follow commands. His speech was reportedly unintelligible the majority of the time, and some of the health care workers thought he was speaking a foreign language. There were no other symptoms or signs. He had no prior history of cerebrovascular disease. Blood pressure 130/70 and Pulse 82 upon admission to the local hospital on 8/14/95. Evaluation at the local hospital included: 1)HCT scan revealed an old left putaminal hypodensity, but no acute changes or evidence of hemorrhage, 2) Carotid Duplex scan showed ICA stenosis of 40%, bilaterally. He was placed on heparin and transferred to UIHC on 8/16/95. In addition, he had noted memory and word finding difficulty for 2 months prior to presentation. He had undergone a gastrectomy 16 years prior for peptic ulcer disease. His local physician found him vitamin B12 deficient and he was placed on vitamin B12 and folate supplementation 2 months prior to presentation. He and his wife felt that this resulted in improvement of his language and cognitive skills. MEDS: Heparin IV, Vitamin B12 injection q. week, Lopressor, Folate, MVI. PMH: 1)Hypothyroidism (reportedly resolved), 2) Gastrectomy, 3)Vitamin B12 deficiency. FHX: Mother died of MI, age 70. Father died of prostate cancer, age 80. Bother died of CAD and prostate cancer, age 74. SHX: Married. 3 children who are alive and well. Semi-retired Attorney. Denied h/o tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP 110/70, HR 50, RR 14, Afebrile. MS: A&O to person and place, but not time. Oral comprehension was poor beyond the simplest of conversational phrases. Speech was fluent, but consisted largely of &quot;word salad.&quot; When asked how he was, he replied: &quot;abadeedleedlebadle.&quot; Repetition was defective, especially with long phrases. On rare occasions, he uttered short comments appropriately. Speech was marred by semantic and phonemic paraphasias. He named colors and described most actions well, although he described a &quot;faucet dripping&quot; as a &quot;faucet drop.&quot; He called &quot;red&quot; &quot;reed.&quot; Reading comprehension was better than aural comprehension. He demonstrated excellent written calculations. Spoken calculations were accurate except when the calculations became more complex. For example, he said that ten percent of 100 was equal to &quot;1,200.&quot; CN: Pupils 2/3 decreasing to 1/1 on exposure to light. VFFTC. There were no field cuts or evidence of visual neglect. EOM were intact. Face moved symmetrically. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: Full strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk. There was no evidence of drift. SENSORY: unremarkable. COORD: unremarkable. Station: unremarkable. Gait: mild difficulty with TW. Reflexes: 2/2 in BUE. 2/2+ patellae, 1/1 Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor on the left and equivocal on the right. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: Lab data on admission: Glucose 97, BUN 20, Na 134, K 4.0, Cr 1.3, Chloride 98, CO2 24, PT 11, PTT 42, WBC 12.0 (normal differential), Hgb 11.4, Hct 36%, Plt=203k. UA normal. TSH 6.0, FT4 0.88, Vit B12 876, Folate 19.1. He was admitted and continued on heparin. MRI scan, 8/16/95, revealed increased signal on T2-weighted images in Wernicke's area in the left temporal region. Transthoracic echocardiogram on 8/17/95 was unremarkable. Transesophageal echocardiogram on 8/18/95 revealed a sclerotic aortic valve and myxomatous degeneration of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. LAE 4.8cm, and spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium were noted. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunt or clot. Carotid duplex scan on 8/16/95 revealed 0-15% BICA stenosis with anterograde vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Neuropsychologic testing revealed a Wernicke's aphasia. The impression was that the patient had had a cardioembolic stroke involving a lower-division branch of the left MCA. He was subsequently placed on warfarin. Thoughout his hospital stay he showed continued improvement of language skills and was enrolled in speech therapy following discharge, 8/21/95. He has had no further stroke like episodes up until his last follow-up visit in 1997.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint**  \nThe patient, a 72‑year‑old man, had trouble speaking.\n\n**History of the event**  \nOn the morning of August 14, 1995 he woke early to get ready for a golf game. He felt fine until about 6:00 AM when his speech became abnormal. His wife said he was speaking “word salad” and “gibberish.” She took him to a local hospital. While on the way he could understand what people said, but by the time he arrived at 6:45 AM he could not follow commands. His speech was mostly unintelligible and some nurses thought he was speaking a foreign language. He had no other symptoms and no history of stroke. His blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg and pulse 82 bpm when he was admitted.\n\n**Initial evaluation at the local hospital**  \n• CT scan showed an old area of low density in the left putamen but no new bleed.  \n• Carotid duplex scan found 40 % narrowing of both internal carotid arteries.  \nHe was started on heparin and transferred to the University of Illinois Hospital on August 16, 1995.\n\n**Past medical history**  \n• Memory and word‑finding problems for the two months before the event.  \n• Had a partial stomach removal (gastrectomy) 16 years earlier for a peptic ulcer.  \n• Two months before the event his doctor found a vitamin B12 deficiency; he was given B12 injections and folate and felt better.  \n• Hypothyroidism (now resolved), gastrectomy, B12 deficiency.  \n• Family: mother died of a heart attack at 70, father died of prostate cancer at 80, brother died of heart disease and prostate cancer at 74.  \n• Married with three living children, semi‑retired attorney, no tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.\n\n**Medications**  \nHeparin IV, vitamin B12 injection weekly, Lopressor (beta‑blocker), folate, multivitamin.\n\n**Physical exam on admission**  \n• Blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate 50 bpm, breathing 14 breaths/min, no fever.  \n• Alert to person and place but not to time.  \n• Could understand only very simple phrases.  \n• Speech was fluent but mostly “word salad.” When asked how he was, he said nonsense.  \n• Repeating long phrases was difficult; short comments were sometimes correct.  \n• Speech errors included wrong words and sounds. He could name colors and describe actions, but misnamed “faucet dripping” as “faucet drop” and called “red” “reed.”  \n• Reading was better than listening. He did well with written math but made mistakes on spoken math when it was complex (e.g., said 10 % of 100 is 1,200).  \n• Vision and eye movements were normal; no visual field loss or neglect.  \n• Face moved symmetrically.  \n• Strength, tone, and reflexes were normal.  \n• Sensation, coordination, and gait were normal except for mild difficulty walking heel‑to‑toe.  \n• Plantar reflexes: flexor on the left, unclear on the right.  \n• Genital exam normal.\n\n**Laboratory results**  \nGlucose 97 mg/dL, BUN 20 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, chloride 98 mEq/L, CO₂ 24 mEq/L, PT 11 s, PTT 42 s, white cells 12.0 k/µL, hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL, hematocrit 36 %, platelets 203 k/µL. Urinalysis normal. TSH 6.0 µIU/mL, free T4 0.88 ng/dL, vitamin B12 876 pg/mL, folate 19.1 ng/mL. He remained on heparin.\n\n**Imaging and cardiac studies**  \n• MRI on August 16, 1995 showed increased signal in the left temporal lobe (Wernicke’s area).  \n• Transthoracic echocardiogram on August 17, 1995 was normal.  \n• Transesophageal echo on August 18, 1995 showed a stiff aortic valve and a floppy part of the mitral valve, enlarged left atrium (4.8 cm) and swirling blood in the left atrium. No clot or abnormal opening.  \n• Carotid duplex on August 16, 1995 showed 0–15 % narrowing of both internal carotid arteries with good flow in the vertebral arteries.\n\n**Neuropsychology**  \nTesting confirmed Wernicke’s aphasia (difficulty understanding and producing speech). The doctors concluded the patient had a cardioembolic stroke affecting a small branch of the left middle cerebral artery. He was started on warfarin.\n\n**Course and outcome**  \nDuring his hospital stay his speech improved. He began speech therapy after discharge on August 21, 1995. He had no further stroke‑like episodes up to his last follow‑up visit in 1997."
