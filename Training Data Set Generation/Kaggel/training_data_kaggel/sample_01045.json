  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed displaced angulated fracture of the right distal radius. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed displaced angulated fracture of the right distal radius. PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist using an Acumed locking plate. ANESTHESIA: General laryngeal mask airway. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOURNIQUET TIME: 40 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. The patient was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 23-year-old gentleman who was involved in a crush injury to his right wrist. He was placed into a well-molded splint after reduction was performed in the emergency department. Further x-rays showed further distal fragment dorsal angulation that progressively worsened and it was felt that surgical intervention was warranted. All risks, benefits, expectations, and complications of the surgery were explained to the patient in detail, and he signed the informed consent for ORIF of the right wrist. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operative table. The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well. The right upper extremity had a well-padded tourniquet placed on the right arm, which was insufflated and maintained for 40 minutes at 250 mmHg pressure. The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A 5-cm incision was made over the flexor carpi radialis of the right wrist. The skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the deep tissue was retracted, blunt dissection was performed down to the pronator quadratus. Sharp dissection was performed through the pronator quadratus after which a tissue elevator was used to elevate this tissue. Next, a reduction was performed placing the distal fragment into appropriate alignment. This was checked under fluoroscopy, and was noted to be adequately reduced and in appropriate position. An Acumed Accu-lock plate was placed along the volar aspect of the distal radius. This was checked under AP and lateral views with C-arm, noted to be in appropriate alignment. A 3.5-mm cortical screw was placed through the proximal aspect of the plate, positioned it into position. Two distal locking screws were placed along the plate itself. The screws were checked under AP and lateral views noting the fracture fragment was well aligned and appropriately reduced with the 2 screws being placed into appropriate position with the appropriate length as well as not being intraarticular. Four more screws were placed along the distal aspect of the plate and 2 more proximal along the plate. All locking screws placed into position and had excellent purchase into the bone or had excellent fixation into the plate and maintained the alignment of the fracture. AP and lateral views were taken of these screw placements again. None of these screws were into the joint and all had appropriate length into the dorsal cortex. Two more 3.5 fully threaded cortical screws were placed along the proximal aspect of the plate and had excellent bicortical purchase. AP and lateral views were taken of the wrist once again showing that this was appropriate reduction of the fracture as well as appropriate placement of the screws. Bicortical purchase was appreciated and no screws were placed into the joint. The wound itself was copiously irrigated with saline and Kantrex after which the subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 nylon stitch; 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the wound site after which sterile dressing was placed as well as the volar splint. The patient was awakened from general anesthetic, transferred to the hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:**  \nThe right wrist had a closed, displaced, angled break in the lower part of the radius bone.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:**  \nThe same closed, displaced, angled break in the right wrist.\n\n**Procedure:**  \nOpen reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist using an Acumed locking plate.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:**  \nMinimal.\n\n**Tourniquet time:**  \n40 minutes.\n\n**Complications:**  \nNone. The patient was taken to the recovery area in stable condition and tolerated the surgery well.\n\n**Indications for surgery:**  \nA 23‑year‑old man had a crush injury to his right wrist. After the emergency department reduced the break, a splint was applied. X‑rays later showed the broken piece had angled more toward the back of the wrist, so surgery was needed. All risks, benefits, expectations, and possible complications were explained, and he gave written consent for the ORIF.\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient was moved to the operating room and laid on his back. General anesthesia was given and the patient tolerated it well. A tourniquet was placed on the right arm, inflated to 250 mmHg, and kept for 40 minutes. The arm was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A 5‑centimeter cut was made over the flexor carpi radialis muscle on the wrist. The skin was cut through to the fat layer, the deeper tissues were moved aside, and blunt dissection reached the pronator quadratus muscle. The pronator quadratus was cut and lifted with a tissue elevator. The broken bone fragments were then aligned correctly. Fluoroscopy (real‑time X‑ray) confirmed the alignment. An Acumed Accu‑lock plate was placed on the inside (volar) side of the distal radius. The plate position was checked with AP and lateral X‑ray views and was correct. A 3.5‑mm cortical screw was inserted through the top part of the plate to secure it. Two locking screws were placed into the plate at the distal end. The screws were checked again on AP and lateral views to confirm the fracture was well aligned and the screws were the right length and not inside the joint. Four more screws were added at the distal end of the plate and two more at the proximal end. All locking screws were in place, had good purchase in the bone, and kept the fracture aligned. AP and lateral X‑ray views were taken again. None of the screws entered the joint, and all had appropriate length into the back (dorsal) cortex. Two additional 3.5‑mm fully threaded cortical screws were placed at the top of the plate and had excellent bicortical purchase (engaging both sides of the bone). AP and lateral views were taken again, showing proper fracture reduction and correct screw placement. The wound was washed thoroughly with saline and Kantrex solution. The subcutaneous tissue was stitched with 2‑0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with a running 4‑0 nylon stitch. 10 mL of 0.5 % Marcaine (plain local anesthetic) was injected into the wound, then a sterile dressing and a volar splint were applied. The patient woke up from anesthesia, was moved to a hospital bed, and taken to the recovery unit in stable condition. He tolerated the procedure well."
