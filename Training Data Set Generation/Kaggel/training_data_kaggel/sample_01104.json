  "medical": "CC: Headache. HX: The patient is an 8y/o RHM with a 2 year history of early morning headaches (3:00-6:00AM) intermittently relieved by vomiting only. He had been evaluated 2 years ago and an EEG was &quot;normal&quot; then, but no brain imaging was performed. His headaches progressively worsened, especially in the past two months prior to this presentation. For 2 weeks prior to his 1/25/93 evaluation at UIHC, he would awake screaming. His parent spoke with a local physician who thought this might be due to irritability secondary to pinworms and Vermox was prescribed and arrangements were made for a neurologic evaluation. On the evening of 1/24/93 the patient awoke screaming and began to vomit. This was followed by a 10 min period of tonic-clonic type movements and postictal lethargy. He was taken to a local ER and a brain CT revealed an intracranial mass. He was given Decadron and Phenytoin and transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. MEDS: noted above. PMH: 1)Born at 37.5 weeks gestation by uncomplicated vaginal delivery to a G1P0 mother. Pregnancy complicated by vaginal bleeding at 7 months. Met developmental milestones without difficulty. 2) Frequent otitis media, now resolved. 3) Immunizations were &quot;up to date.&quot; FHX: non-contributory. SHX: lives with biologic father and mother. No siblings. In 3rd grade (mainstream) and maintaining good marks in schools. EXAM: BP121/57mmHg HR103 RR16 36.9C MS: Sleepy, but cooperative. CN: EOM full and smooth. Advanced papilledema, OU. VFFTC. Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2. Right lower facial weakness. Tongue midline upon protrusion. Corneal reflexes intact bilaterally. Motor: 5/5 strength. Slightly increased muscle on right side. Sensory. No deficit to PP/VIB noted. Coord: normal FNF, HKS and RAM, bilaterally. Station: Mild truncal ataxia. Tends to fall backward. Reflexes: BUE 2+/2+, Patellar 3/3, Ankles 3+/3+ with 6 beats of nonsustained clonus bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: The patient was continued on Dilantin 200mg qd and Decadron 5mg IV q6hrs. Brain MRI, 1/26/93, revealed a large mass lesion in the region of the left caudate nucleus and thalamus which was hyperintense on T2 weighted images. There were areas of cystic formation at its periphery. The mass appeared to enhance on post gadolinium images. there was associated white matter edema and compression of the left lateral ventricle, and midline shift to the right. There was no sign of uncal herniation. He underwent bilateral VP shunting on 1/26/93; and then, subtotal resection (left frontal craniotomy with excision of the left caudate and thalamus with creation of an opening in the septum pellucidum) on 1/28/93. He then received 5040cGy of radiation therapy in 28 fractions completed on 3/25/93. A 3/20/95 neuropsychological evaluation revealed low average intellect on the WISC-III. There were also signs of memory, attention, reading and spelling deficits; and mild right-sided motor incoordination and mood variability. He remained in mainstream classes at school, but his physical and cognitive performance began to deteriorate in 4/95. Neurosurgical evaluation in 4/95 noted increased right hemiplegia and right homonymous hemianopia. MRI revealed tumor progression and he was subsequently placed on Carboplatin/VP-16 (CG 9933 protocol chemotherapy, regimen A). He was last seen on 4/96 and was having difficulty in the 6th grade; he was also undergoing physical therapy for his right hemiplegia.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Headache.  \n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nThe patient is an 8‑year‑old boy who has had headaches for the past 2 years. They occur early in the morning (between 3:00 and 6:00 AM) and only get better when he vomits. Two years ago he was checked; an EEG was normal but no brain scan was done. The headaches have gotten worse, especially in the last 2 months before he came to the hospital. For the 2 weeks before his visit on January 25 1993 he would wake up screaming. His parent talked to a local doctor who thought the problem might be due to pinworms, so the child was given Vermox and a neurologic evaluation was arranged. On the evening of January 24 1993 he woke up screaming, vomited, then had a 10‑minute episode of stiff‑limb movements (a seizure) and was sleepy afterward. He was taken to a local emergency department where a brain CT scan showed an intracranial mass. He was given Decadron (a steroid) and Phenytoin (a seizure drug) and was transferred to UIHC for further care.\n\n**Medications:** As noted above.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1. Born at 37.5 weeks by normal vaginal delivery to a first‑time mother. Pregnancy had vaginal bleeding at 7 months. He reached developmental milestones normally.  \n2. Frequent ear infections, now resolved.  \n3. All vaccines up to date.  \n\n**Family History:** None relevant.  \n\n**Social History:** Lives with both parents, no siblings. He is in third grade and doing well in school.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- Blood pressure 121/57 mmHg, heart rate 103, breathing 16, temperature 36.9 °C.  \n- Sleepy but cooperative.  \n- Eye movements normal.  \n- Swelling of the optic discs in both eyes (advanced papilledema).  \n- Vision fine.  \n- Pupils 4 mm, narrowing to 2 mm.  \n- Weakness on the lower part of the right face.  \n- Tongue straight when protruded.  \n- Corneal reflexes normal.  \n- Muscle strength 5/5, slightly stronger on the right side.  \n- No sensory loss.  \n- Coordination normal.  \n- Mild trouble walking straight, tends to fall backward.  \n- Reflexes: arms 2+/2+, knees 3/3, ankles 3+/3+ with brief clonus on both sides.  \n- General exam normal.\n\n**Course:**  \nHe continued on Dilantin 200 mg once daily and Decadron 5 mg IV every 6 hours. A brain MRI on January 26 1993 showed a large mass in the left caudate nucleus and thalamus that was bright on T2 images. The mass had cyst‑like areas around it and brightened after contrast. There was swelling of nearby white matter, pressure on the left lateral ventricle, and a shift of the brain to the right. No herniation was seen.  \nHe had a bilateral ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt on January 26 1993, then a subtotal removal of the tumor (left frontal craniotomy, removal of the left caudate and thalamus, and opening of the septum pellucidum) on January 28 1993. He received 5,040 cGy of radiation in 28 sessions, finished on March 25 1993.  \nA neuropsychological test on March 20 1995 showed average intelligence but problems with memory, attention, reading, spelling, mild right‑side coordination issues, and mood swings. He stayed in regular classes, but his physical and mental performance worsened in April 1995. A neurosurgical check in April 1995 noted increased right‑side weakness and loss of vision on the right side. An MRI showed the tumor had grown again, so he was started on Carboplatin/VP‑16 chemotherapy (CG 9933 protocol, regimen A). He was last seen in April 1996, struggling in sixth grade and receiving physical therapy for his right‑side weakness."
