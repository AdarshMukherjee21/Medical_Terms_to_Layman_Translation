  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Blood loss anemia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Diverticulosis coli. 2. Internal hemorrhoids. 3. Poor prep. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with photos. ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation per Anesthesia. SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY: The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a markedly decreased hemoglobin and blood loss anemia. She underwent an EGD and attempted colonoscopy; however, due to a very poor prep, only a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at that time. A coloscopy is now being performed for completion. PROCEDURE: After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Endoscopy Suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given sedation by the Anesthesia Department. A digital rectal exam was performed and there was no evidence of mass. The colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum. There was some solid stool encountered. The scope was maneuvered around this. There was relatively poor prep as the scope was advanced through the sigmoid colon and portions of the descending colon. The scope was then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum. No masses or polyps were noted. Visualization of the portions of the colon was however somewhat limited. There were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid. The scope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls. Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids were noted. The scope was then completely withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. She will be placed on a high-fiber diet and Colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin.",

Poor bowel prep.  \n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with photos.  \nANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation.  \nSPECIMENS: None.  \n\nHISTORY: An 85‑year‑old woman was admitted because her hemoglobin was very low from blood loss anemia. She had an upper‑GI endoscopy (EGD) and an attempted colonoscopy, but the bowel prep was so poor that only a flexible sigmoidoscopy could be done. A full colonoscopy is now being done to finish the exam.  \n\nPROCEDURE: After the patient gave informed consent, she was taken to the endoscopy room. She was placed on her left side and given sedation by the anesthesia team. A digital rectal exam was done and no mass was found. The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum. Some solid stool was encountered, but the scope was maneuvered around it. The prep was still poor, so the scope could only be advanced through the sigmoid and part of the descending colon. It then passed through the transverse and ascending colon to the cecum. No masses or polyps were seen, but the view was limited. Several small pouches (diverticuli) were seen in the sigmoid colon. The scope was slowly withdrawn, checking all walls. When it reached the rectum, it was bent back (retroflexed) and non‑surgical internal hemorrhoids were seen. The scope was then fully removed.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was moved to the recovery room in stable condition. She will be put on a high‑fiber diet and Colace, and her hemoglobin will continue to be monitored."
