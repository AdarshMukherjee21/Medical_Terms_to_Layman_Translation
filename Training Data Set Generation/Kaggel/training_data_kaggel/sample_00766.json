  "medical": "TITLE OF OPERATION: Revision laminectomy L5-S1, discectomy L5-S1, right medial facetectomy, preparation of disk space and arthrodesis with interbody graft with BMP. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: Please refer to medical record, but in short, the patient is a 43-year-old male known to me, status post previous lumbar surgery for herniated disk with severe recurrence of axial back pain, failed conservative therapy. Risks and benefits of surgery were explained in detail including risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, heart attack, paralysis, need for further surgery, hardware failure, persistent symptoms, and death. This list was inclusive, but not exclusive. An informed consent was obtained after all patient's questions were answered. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe lumbar spondylosis L5-S1, collapsed disk space, hypermobility, and herniated disk posteriorly. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe lumbar spondylosis L5-S1, collapsed disk space, hypermobility, and herniated disk posteriorly. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia and endotracheal tube intubation. DISPOSITION: The patient to PACU with stable vital signs. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room. After adequate general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation was obtained, the patient was placed prone on the Jackson table. Lumbar spine was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An incision was carried out from L4 to S1. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar and Bovie cauterization. A Weitlaner was placed in the wound and a subperiosteal dissection was carried out identifying the lamina of L4, L5, and sacrum. At this time, laminectomy was carried out of L5-S1. Thecal sac was retracted rightward and the foramen was opened and unilateral medial facetectomy was carried out in the disk space. At this time, the disk was entered with a #15 blade and bipolar. The disk was entered with straight up and down-biting pituitaries, curettes, and the high speed drill and we were able to takedown calcified herniated disk. We were able to reestablish the disk space, it was very difficult, required meticulous dissection and then drilling with a diamond bur in the disk space underneath the spinal canal, very carefully holding the spinal canal out of harm's way as well as the exiting nerve root. Once this was done, we used rasps to remove more disk material anteriorly and under the midline to the left side and then we put in interbody graft of BMP 8 mm graft from Medtronic. At this time, Dr. X will dictate the posterolateral fusion, pedicle screw fixation to L4 to S1 with compression and will dictate the closure of the wound. There were no complications.",
  "layman": "**Title of the operation:**  \nRevision laminectomy at L5‑S1, removal of the disc at L5‑S1, removal of part of the right facet joint, preparation of the disc space, and fusion with a bone graft that contains BMP.\n\n**Why the surgery was needed:**  \nThe patient is a 43‑year‑old man who had a previous back surgery for a herniated disc. He now has severe back pain that has come back, and all non‑surgical treatments have failed. The surgeon explained the risks (bleeding, infection, stroke, heart attack, paralysis, need for more surgery, hardware problems, ongoing pain, and death) and the benefits. The patient gave informed consent after all his questions were answered.\n\n**Diagnosis before surgery:**  \nSevere wear and tear of the lower back at L5‑S1, a collapsed disc space, too much movement, and a herniated disc pressing on the back side.\n\n**Diagnosis after surgery:**  \nSame as before: severe wear and tear at L5‑S1, collapsed disc space, too much movement, and a herniated disc on the back side.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia with a breathing tube.\n\n**After the operation:**  \nThe patient was taken to the recovery area (PACU) with stable vital signs.\n\n**What was done during the operation:**  \nThe patient was put in the operating room and given general anesthesia with a breathing tube. He was positioned face‑down on a special table. The lower back was shaved, cleaned, and covered with sterile drapes. The surgeon made an incision from the L4 vertebra to the S1 vertebra. Bleeding was controlled with cautery. A small metal rod (Weitlaner) was placed in the wound and the surgeon carefully separated the tissues to expose the L4, L5, and sacrum bones. The surgeon removed the bone over the L5‑S1 area (laminectomy). The spinal cord was gently moved to the right, and the opening to the nerve root was widened. The surgeon removed part of the right facet joint. The disc was entered with a small blade and cautery. The surgeon used specialized tools (pituitary forceps, curettes, and a high‑speed drill) to remove the calcified herniated disc. The disc space was then carefully cleared and re‑opened using a diamond drill, taking care not to damage the spinal canal or the nerve root. More disc material was removed with rasps. An 8‑mm bone graft with BMP from Medtronic was placed into the disc space. The surgeon then performed a posterolateral fusion and fixed the vertebrae from L4 to S1 with pedicle screws and compression. The wound was closed. No complications occurred."
