  "medical": "REASON FOR VISIT: Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, a 16-year-old right-handed boy who is in eleventh grade, who presents with some blurred vision and visual acuity difficulties, was found to have a suprasellar tumor. He was brought to the operating room on 01/04/07, underwent a transsphenoidal resection of tumor. Histology returned as craniopharyngioma. There is some residual disease; however, the visual apparatus was decompressed. According to him, he is doing well, back at school without any difficulties. He has some occasional headaches and tinnitus, but his vision is much improved. MEDICATIONS: Synthroid 100 mcg per day. FINDINGS: On exam, he is awake, alert and oriented x 3. Pupils are equal and reactive. EOMs are full. His visual acuity is 20/25 in the right (improved from 20/200) and the left is 20/200 improved from 20/400. He has a bitemporal hemianopsia, which is significantly improved and wider. His motor is 5 out of 5. There are no focal motor or sensory deficits. The abdominal incision is well healed. There is no evidence of erythema or collection. The lumbar drain was also well healed. The postoperative MRI demonstrates small residual disease. Histology returned as craniopharyngioma. ASSESSMENT: Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma with residual disease. PLANS: I have recommended that he call. I discussed the options with our radiation oncologist, Dr. X. They will schedule the appointment to see him. In addition, he probably will need an MRI prior to any treatment, to follow the residual disease.",
  "layman": "REASON FOR VISIT: Follow‑up after surgery for a craniopharyngioma.  \n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 16‑year‑old right‑handed boy in 11th grade had blurred vision and trouble seeing clearly. He was found to have a tumor above the pituitary gland. He had surgery on 01/04/07 to remove the tumor through the nose. The tissue was confirmed to be a craniopharyngioma. Some tumor remains, but the pressure on his eyes has been relieved. He says he is doing well, back at school with no problems. He has occasional headaches and ringing in his ears, but his vision has improved a lot.  \n\nMEDICATIONS: Synthroid 100 mcg daily.  \n\nFINDINGS: On exam he is awake, alert, and knows who he is, what place he is in, and the time. His pupils are the same size and react to light. Eye movements are normal. His right eye vision is 20/25 (better than 20/200 before) and his left eye is 20/200 (better than 20/400 before). He still has a loss of side vision in both eyes, but it is much wider than before. Muscle strength is normal (5/5). There are no specific weakness or numbness. The belly scar from surgery is healing well with no redness or fluid. The lumbar drain site is also healing well. An MRI after surgery shows a small amount of remaining tumor.  \n\nASSESSMENT: Follow‑up after surgery for a craniopharyngioma with some tumor left.  \n\nPLANS: I told him to call if anything changes. I talked with our radiation oncologist, Dr. X, about next steps. They will set up an appointment for him. He will likely need another MRI before any treatment to check the remaining tumor."
