  "medical": "CC: Progressive lower extremity weakness. HX: This 54 y/o RHF presented on 7/3/93 with a 2 month history of lower extremity weakness. She was admitted to a local hospital on 5/3/93 for a 3 day h/o of progressive BLE weakness associated with incontinence and BLE numbness. There was little symptom of upper extremity weakness at that time, according to the patient. Her evaluation was notable for a bilateral L1 sensory level and 4/4 strength in BLE. A T-L-S Spine MRI revealed a T4-6 lipomatosis with anterior displacement of the cord without cord compression. CSF analysis yielded: opening pressure of 14cm H20, protein 88, glucose 78, 3 lymphocytes and 160 RBC, no oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index, and negative cytology. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. B12, Folate, and Ferritin levels were normal. CRP 5.2 (elevated). ANA was positive at 1:5,120 in speckled pattern. Her hospital course was complicated by deep venous thrombosis, which recurred after heparin was stopped to do the bone marrow biopsy. She was subsequently placed on Coumadin. EMG/NCV testing revealed &quot; lumbosacral polyradiculopathy with axonal degeneration and nerve conduction block.&quot; She was diagnosed with atypical Guillain-Barre vs. polyradiculopathy and received a single course of Decadron; and no plasmapheresis or IV IgG. She was discharged home o 6/8/93. She subsequently did not improve and after awaking from a nap on her couch the day of presentation, 7/3/93, she found she was paralyzed from the waist down. There was associated mild upper lumbar back pain without radiation. She had had no bowel movement or urination since that time. She had no recent trauma, fever, chills, changes in vision, dysphagia or upper extremity deficit. MEDS: Coumadin 7.5mg qd, Zoloft 50mg qd, Lithium 300mg bid. PMH: 1) Bi-polar Affective Disorder, dx 1979 2) C-section. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP118/64, HR103, RR18, Afebrile. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent without dysarthria. Lucid thought processes. CN: Unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength in BUE. Plegic in BLE. Flaccid muscle tone. SENSORY: L1 sensory level (bilaterally) to PP and TEMP, without sacral sparing. Proprioception was lost in both feet. CORD: Normal in BUE. Reflexes were 2+/2+ in BUE. They were not elicited in BLE. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally. RECTAL: Poor rectal tone. stool guaiac negative. She had no perirectal sensation. COURSE: CRP 8.8 and ESR 76. FVC 2.17L. WBC 1.5 (150 bands, 555 neutrophils, 440 lymphocytes and 330 monocytes), Hct 33%, Hgb 11.0, Plt 220K, MCV 88, GS normal except for slightly low total protein (8.0). LFT were normal. Creatinine 1.0. PT and PTT were normal. ABCG 7.46/25/79/96% O2Sat. UA notable for 1+ proteinuria. EKG normal. MRI L-spine, 7/3/93, revealed an area of abnormally increased T2 signal extending from T12 through L5. This area causes anterior displacement of the spinal cord and nerve roots. The cauda equina are pushed up against the posterior L1 vertebral body. There bilaterally pulmonary effusions. There is also abnormally increased T2 signal in the center of the spinal cord extending from the mid thoracic level through the conus. In addition, the Fila Terminale appear thickened. There is increased signal in the T3 vertebral body suggestion a hemangioma. The findings were felt consistent with a large epidural lipoma displacing the spinal cord anteriorly. there also appeared spinal cord swelling and increased signal within the spinal cord which suggests an intramedullary process. CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,342, glucose 43, RBC 4,900, WBC 9. C3 and C$ complement levels were 94 and 18 respectively (normal) Anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. Serum Beta-2 microglobulin was elevated at 2.4 and 3.7 in the CSF and Serum, respectively. It was felt the patient had either a transverse myelitis associated with SLE vs. partial cord infarction related to lupus vasculopathy or hypercoagulable state. She was place on IV Decadron. Rheumatology felt that a diagnosis of SLE was likely. Pulmonary effusion analysis was consistent with an exudate. She was treated with plasma exchange and place on Cytoxan. On 7/22/93 she developed fever with associated proptosis and sudden loss of vision, OD. MRI Brain, 7/22/93, revealed a 5mm thick area of intermediate signal adjacent to the posterior aspect of the right globe, possibly representing hematoma. Ophthalmology felt she had a central retinal vein occlusion; and it was surgically decompressed. She was placed on prednisone on 8/11/93 and Cytoxan was started on 8/16/93. She developed a headache with meningismus on 8/20/93. CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,002, glucose2, WBC 8,925 (majority were neutrophils). Sinus CT scan negative. She was placed on IV Antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis. Cultures were subsequently negative. She spontaneously recovered. 8/25/93, cisternal tap CSF analysis revealed: protein 126, glucose 35, WBC 144 (neutrophils), RBC 95, Cultures negative, cytology negative. MRI Brain scan revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement in both brain and spinal canal. DSDNA negative. She developed leukopenia in 9/93, and she was switched from Cytoxan to Imuran. Her LFT's rose and the Imuran was stopped and she was placed back on prednisone. She went on to have numerous deep venous thrombosis while on Coumadin. This required numerous hospital admissions for heparinization. Anticardiolipin antibodies and Protein C and S testing was negative.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:**  \nThe patient, a 54‑year‑old woman, has been getting weaker in her legs.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \n- On July 3, 1993 she had been feeling weak in both legs for about two months.  \n- She was first admitted to a local hospital on May 3, 1993 because her legs were getting weaker, she had numbness, and she could not control her bladder.  \n- At that time she had a sensory level at the L1 vertebra (the lower back) and her leg strength was still 4/4 (normal).  \n- An MRI of her thoracic and lumbar spine showed a fatty growth (lipoma) from T4‑T6 that pushed the spinal cord forward but did not compress it.  \n- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests were mostly normal, except for a slightly high protein level and a few red blood cells.  \n- Blood tests were normal for vitamin B12, folate, ferritin, and other routine labs.  \n- Inflammation markers were a bit high (CRP 5.2).  \n- An autoimmune test (ANA) was strongly positive.  \n- She developed a deep‑vein blood clot while on heparin, which was stopped for a bone‑marrow biopsy. She was then put on Coumadin (warfarin).  \n- Nerve studies (EMG/NCV) showed damage to the nerves in the lower back and legs.  \n- She was treated with a single course of steroids (Decadron) but did not get better.  \n- On July 3, 1993 she woke up and found she was paralyzed from the waist down. She had mild lower back pain, no bowel or bladder control, and no recent injury or fever.\n\n**Medications at that time:**  \n- Coumadin 7.5 mg daily  \n- Zoloft 50 mg daily  \n- Lithium 300 mg twice daily  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n- Bipolar disorder (diagnosed 1979)  \n- Cesarean section  \n\n**Social history:**  \n- No tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.  \n\n**Physical exam (July 3, 1993):**  \n- Blood pressure 118/64, heart rate 103, normal breathing, no fever.  \n- Alert and oriented.  \n- Speech normal.  \n- Upper‑body strength 5/5, legs paralyzed and flaccid.  \n- Sensation lost below L1 on both sides; no feeling of position in the feet.  \n- Reflexes normal in arms, absent in legs.  \n- Weak anal tone, no rectal sensation.  \n\n**Follow‑up labs and imaging:**  \n- Inflammation markers rose (CRP 8.8, ESR 76).  \n- Lung function test (FVC) low at 2.17 L.  \n- White‑blood‑cell count low (1.5 k) with many bands and neutrophils.  \n- Blood chemistry mostly normal.  \n- Urine had mild protein.  \n- MRI of the lumbar spine (July 3) showed a large area of abnormal signal from T12 to L5, pushing the spinal cord and nerve roots forward.  \n- The spinal cord itself had swelling and abnormal signal from mid‑thoracic to the lower end.  \n- CSF now had very high protein (1,342 mg/dL), low glucose (43 mg/dL), many red blood cells (4,900) and a few white cells (9).  \n- Complement levels normal.  \n- Anticardiolipin antibodies negative.  \n- Beta‑2 microglobulin high in CSF and serum.  \n\n**Diagnosis considered:**  \n- Transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) possibly related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or a clotting problem from lupus.  \n- A large fatty growth (epidural lipoma) pushing the cord.  \n\n**Treatment:**  \n- High‑dose steroids (IV Decadron).  \n- Rheumatology thought SLE was likely.  \n- She had fluid in the lungs (effusions) that was an exudate.  \n- She received plasma exchange and was started on Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide).  \n\n**Complications:**  \n- On July 22, she developed fever, eye swelling, and sudden loss of vision in the right eye.  \n- MRI of the brain showed a small area near the right eye, possibly a hematoma.  \n- Ophthalmology diagnosed a central retinal vein occlusion and performed surgery to relieve pressure.  \n- She was put on prednisone (starting August 11) and Cytoxan (starting August 16).  \n\n- On August 20 she had a severe headache and neck stiffness.  \n- CSF showed very high protein (1,002 mg/dL), very low glucose (2 mg/dL), and many white cells (8,925, mostly neutrophils).  \n- A sinus CT scan was normal.  \n- She was treated with IV antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis, but cultures were negative. She recovered on her own.  \n\n- On August 25 a CSF tap showed protein 126 mg/dL, glucose 35 mg/dL, 144 white cells (neutrophils), 95 red cells; cultures and cytology were negative.  \n- MRI of the brain showed diffuse enhancement of the meninges (the protective covering of brain and spinal cord).  \n\n- In September she developed low white‑blood cells, so Cytoxan was switched to Imuran (azathioprine).  \n- Liver tests rose, so Imuran was stopped and she was put back on prednisone.  \n\n- She had many more deep‑vein clots while on Coumadin, requiring repeated hospital stays and heparin treatment.  \n- Tests for anticardiolipin antibodies, Protein C, and Protein S were all negative.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe patient has a complex history of progressive paralysis of the legs, likely due to spinal cord inflammation (transverse myelitis) possibly linked to lupus or a clotting disorder. She has also had a large fatty growth in the spine, multiple infections, eye problems, meningitis, and many blood clots, and has been treated with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, plasma exchange, and anticoagulants."
