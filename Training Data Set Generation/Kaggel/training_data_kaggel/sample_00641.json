  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is a 78-year-old right-handed inpatient with longstanding history of cervical spinal stenosis status post decompression, opioid dependence, who has had longstanding low back pain radiating into the right leg. She was undergoing a spinal epidural injection about a month ago and had worsening of right low back pain, which radiates down into her buttocks and down to posterior aspect of her thigh into her knee. This has required large amounts of opioid analgesics to control. She has been basically bedridden because of this. She was brought into hospital for further investigations. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, she has positive straight leg rising on the right with severe shooting, radicular type pain with right leg movement. Difficult to assess individual muscles, but strength is largely intact. Sensory examination is symmetric. Deep tendon reflexes reveal hyporeflexia in both patellae, which probably represents a cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression. She has slightly decreased right versus left ankle reflexes. The Babinski's are positive. On nerve conduction studies, motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in lower extremities. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It reveals the spontaneous activity in right peroneus longus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles as well as the right lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There is evidence of denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis muscle. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: 1. Inactive right S1 (L5) radiculopathy. 2. There is no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy or entrapment neuropathy. Results were discussed with the patient and she is scheduled for imaging studies in the next day.",
  "layman": "**History:**  \nThe patient is a 78‑year‑old right‑handed woman who has had cervical spinal stenosis for many years and has had surgery to relieve it. She also depends on opioids. She has long‑standing lower back pain that shoots into her right leg. About a month ago she had a spinal epidural injection, but her right back pain got worse. The pain now goes from her lower back into her buttocks, down the back of her thigh, and to her knee. She needs a lot of opioid pain medicine to manage it. Because of the pain she has been mostly bedridden. She was admitted to the hospital for further tests.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \nDuring the exam, her right leg shows a positive straight‑leg‑raise test with sharp, shooting pain when she moves the leg. It is hard to test each muscle, but overall strength is mostly fine. Her sense of touch is the same on both sides. Reflexes in both knees are weaker than normal, likely due to her earlier cervical spinal cord compression. Her ankle reflex is a little weaker on the right than the left. She has a positive Babinski sign. Nerve‑conduction studies of the lower limbs show normal motor and sensory timing, wave sizes, speeds, and F‑waves.\n\n**Needle EMG:**  \nA needle EMG was done on the right leg and the lower back muscles. It shows abnormal spontaneous activity in the right peroneus longus, right gastrocnemius medialis, and right lower back muscles. There is evidence of muscle loss (denervation) in the right gastrocnemius medialis.\n\n**Impression:**  \nThe electrical study is abnormal and indicates:  \n1. An inactive right S1 (L5) nerve root problem.  \n2. No nerve root, peripheral nerve, or entrapment problems on the left leg.  \n\nThe results were explained to the patient, and she is scheduled to have imaging studies the next day."
