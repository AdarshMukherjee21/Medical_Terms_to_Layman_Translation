In addition, she felt spoke as though she &quot;was drunk.&quot; Nevertheless, she was able to comprehend what was being spoken around her. Her difficulty with speech completely resolved by 12:00 noon. She was brought to UIHC ETC at 8:30AM on 11/23/92 for evaluation. MEDS: none. ALLERGIES: ASA/ PCN both cause rash. PMH: 1)?HTN. 2)COPD. 3)h/o hepatitis (unknown type). 4)Macular degeneration. SHX: Widowed; lives alone. Denied ETOH/Tobacco/illicit drug use. FHX: unremarkable. EXAM: BP191/89 HR68 RR16 37.2C MS: A & O to person, place and time. Speech fluent; without dysarthria. Intact naming, comprehension, and repetition. CN: Central scotoma, OS (old). Mild upper lid ptosis, OD (old per picture). Lower left facial weakness. Motor: Mild Left hemiparesis (4+ to 5- strength throughout affected side). No mention of muscle tone in chart. Sensory: unremarkable. Coord: impaired FNF and HKS movement secondary to weakness. Station: Left pronator drift. No Romberg sign seen. Gait: Left hemiparetic gait with decreased LUE swing. Reflexes: 3/3+ biceps and triceps. 3/3+ patellae. 2/3+ ankles with 3-4beats of non-sustained ankle clonus on left. Plantars: Left babinski sign; and flexor on right. General Exam: 2/6 SEM at left sternal border. COURSE: GS, CBC, PT, PTT, CK, ESR were within normal limits. ABC 7.4/46/63 on room air. EKG showed a sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block. MRI brain, 11/23/95, revealed a right pontine pyramidal tract infarction. She was treated with Ticlopidine 250mg bid. On 11/26/92, her left hemiparesis worsened. A HCT, 11/27/92, was unremarkable. The patient was treated with IV Heparin. This was discontinued the following day when her strength returned to that noted on 11/23/95. On 11/27/92, she developed angina and was ruled out for MI by serial EKG and cardiac enzyme studies. Carotid duplex showed 0-15% bilateral ICA stenosis and antegrade vertebral artery flow bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed aortic insufficiency only. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, aortic valvular fibrosis. There was calcification and possible thrombus seen in the descending aorta. Cardiology did not feel the later was an indication for anticoagulation. She was discharged home on Isordil 20 tid, Metoprolol 25mg q12hours, and Ticlid 250mg bid.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Weakness on the left side.  \n\n**History:** A 74‑year‑old woman with a history of right‑hand failure woke from a nap at 11:00 AM on 11/22/1992 and felt weak on her left side. She needed help walking on that side. She also felt as if she were “drunk,” but she could understand what people were saying. Her speech problems disappeared by noon. She was taken to the University of Illinois Hospital Emergency Treatment Center at 8:30 AM on 11/23/1992 for evaluation.  \n\n**Medications:** None.  \n**Allergies:** Rash with aspirin and penicillin.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. High blood pressure  \n2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  \n3. Hepatitis (type unknown)  \n4. Macular degeneration  \n\n**Social history:** Widowed, lives alone, does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illegal drugs.  \n\n**Family history:** Unremarkable.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 191/89 mm Hg, heart rate 68 bpm, respirations 16/min, temperature 37.2 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  \n- Speech fluent, no slurred speech. Can name, understand, and repeat words.  \n- Vision: central blind spot in the left eye (old). Mild drooping of the upper eyelid on the right (old).  \n- Facial weakness on the lower left side.  \n- Muscle strength: mild weakness on the left side (4+ to 5‑) throughout. No tone noted.  \n- Sensation normal.  \n- Coordination: difficulty with finger‑to‑nose and heel‑to‑shin tests on the left because of weakness.  \n- Left arm drifts downward when held up. No balance problems.  \n- Walking: left‑side weakness, left arm swings less.  \n- Reflexes: normal in arms, slightly brisk in knees, slightly brisk in ankles with brief clonus on the left.  \n- Plantar reflex: Babinski sign on the left, normal on the right.  \n- Heart: 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  \n\n**Course and tests:**  \n- Blood tests (CBC, PT, PTT, CK, ESR) normal.  \n- Blood gases: pH 7.4, PaCO₂ 46, PaO₂ 63 on room air.  \n- ECG: normal sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block.  \n- MRI of the brain (11/23/1995) showed a small stroke in the right part of the brainstem.  \n- Treated with ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily.  \n\nOn 11/26/1992 her left weakness got worse. A head CT on 11/27/1992 was normal. She received IV heparin, which was stopped the next day when her strength returned to the level seen on 11/23/1995. On 11/27/1992 she had chest pain; serial ECGs and heart enzymes ruled out a heart attack.  \n\nCarotid ultrasound showed 0‑15 % narrowing of both internal carotid arteries and normal flow in the vertebral arteries. A transthoracic echo showed only aortic valve leakage. A transesophageal echo showed minor leakage of the mitral and tricuspid valves, aortic valve scarring, and some calcium and possible clot in the descending aorta. The cardiology team decided this did not require blood thinners.  \n\n**Discharge medications:** Isordil 20 mg three times a day, metoprolol 25 mg twice a day, and ticlopidine 250 mg twice a day."
