  "medical": "CC: Orthostatic lightheadedness. HX: This 76 y/o male complained of several months of generalized weakness and malaise, and a two week history of progressively worsening orthostatic dizziness. The dizziness worsened when moving into upright positions. In addition, he complained of intermittent throbbing holocranial headaches, which did not worsen with positional change, for the past several weeks. He had lost 40 pounds over the past year and denied any recent fever, SOB, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis, melena, hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum, polyuria, night sweats, visual changes, or syncopal episodes. He had a 100+ pack-year history of tobacco use and continued to smoke 1 to 2 packs per day. He has a history of sinusitis. EXAM: BP 98/80 mmHg and pulse 64 BPM (supine); BP 70/palpable mmHG and pulse 84BPM (standing). RR 12, Afebrile. Appeared fatigued. CN: unremarkable. Motor and Sensory exam: unremarkable. Coord: Slowed but otherwise unremarkable movements. Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all 4 extremities. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. The rest of the neurologic and general physical exam was unremarkable. LAB: Na 121 meq/L, K 4.2 meq/L, Cl 90 meq/L, CO2 20meq/L, BUN 12mg/DL, CR 1.0mg/DL, Glucose 99mg/DL, ESR 30mm/hr, CBC WNL with nl WBC differential, Urinalysis: SG 1.016 and otherwise WNL, TSH 2.8 IU/ML, FT4 0.9ng/DL, Urine Osmolality 246 MOSM/Kg (low), Urine Na 35 meq/L, COURSE: The patient was initially hydrated with IV normal saline and his orthostatic hypotension resolved, but returned within 24-48hrs. Further laboratory studies revealed: Aldosterone (serum)&lt;2ng/DL (low), 30 minute Cortrosyn Stimulation test: pre 6.9ug/DL (borderline low), post 18.5ug/DL (normal stimulation rise), Prolactin 15.5ng/ML (no baseline given), FSH and LH were within normal limits for males. Testosterone 33ng/DL (wnl). Sinus XR series (done for history of headache) showed an abnormal sellar region with enlarged sella tursica and destruction of the posterior clinoids. There was also an abnormal calcification seen in the middle of the sellar region. A left maxillary sinus opacity with air-fluid level was seen. Goldman visual field testing was unremarkable. Brain CT and MRI revealed suprasellar mass most consistent with pituitary adenoma. He was treated with Fludrocortisone 0.05 mg BID and within 24hrs, despite discontinuation of IV fluids, remained hemodynamically stable and free of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. His presumed pituitary adenoma continues to be managed with Fludrocortisone as of this writing (1/1997), though he has developed dementia felt secondary to cerebrovascular disease (stroke/TIA).",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Lightheadedness when standing up.  \n**History:** A 76‑year‑old man has felt weak and generally unwell for several months. For the last two weeks he has had dizziness that gets worse when he stands. He also has had throbbing headaches all over his head for several weeks that do not get worse when he changes position. He has lost 40 pounds in the past year. He denies fever, shortness of breath, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing up blood, black or bloody stools, bright red rectal bleeding, excessive urination, night sweats, vision changes, or fainting. He has smoked more than 100 pack‑years and still smokes 1–2 packs a day. He has a history of sinus infections.  \n\n**Exam:**  \n- Blood pressure lying down: 98/80 mmHg, pulse 64 bpm.  \n- Blood pressure standing: 70 mmHg (only palpable), pulse 84 bpm.  \n- Respiratory rate 12, no fever.  \n- Looks tired.  \n- Cranial nerves normal.  \n- Muscle strength and sensation normal.  \n- Coordination a little slow but otherwise fine.  \n- Reflexes normal and symmetrical.  \n- Plantar responses normal.  \n- Rest of neurological and general exam normal.  \n\n**Labs:**  \n- Sodium 121 mEq/L (low), potassium 4.2, chloride 90, CO₂ 20, BUN 12, creatinine 1.0, glucose 99.  \n- ESR 30 mm/hr.  \n- CBC normal with normal white‑cell differential.  \n- Urine specific gravity 1.016, otherwise normal.  \n- TSH 2.8, free T4 0.9.  \n- Urine osmolality 246 mOsm/kg (low), urine sodium 35.  \n\n**Course:**  \nHe was given IV normal saline, which stopped his dizziness, but it returned within 24–48 hours. Additional tests showed:  \n- Low serum aldosterone (<2 ng/dL).  \n- 30‑minute corticotropin test: baseline 6.9 µg/dL (borderline low), after stimulation 18.5 µg/dL (normal rise).  \n- Prolactin 15.5 ng/mL.  \n- FSH and LH normal for a male.  \n- Testosterone 33 ng/dL (normal).  \n\nImaging:  \n- Sinus X‑ray showed an enlarged pituitary region with bone destruction and a calcification in the middle of the pituitary area.  \n- A left maxillary sinus opacity with fluid was seen.  \n- Visual field test normal.  \n- Brain CT and MRI found a mass above the pituitary gland, most likely a pituitary adenoma.  \n\nTreatment:  \nHe was started on fludrocortisone 0.05 mg twice daily. Within 24 hours, even after stopping IV fluids, his blood pressure stayed stable and he no longer had dizziness when standing. He continues to take fludrocortisone for the pituitary adenoma (since January 1997). He has also developed dementia, thought to be due to small strokes or transient ischemic attacks."
