Lumbar discogram L5-S1. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the Radiology Suite and placed prone onto a radiolucent table. The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained. We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile. Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space. A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined. A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections. A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus. We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels. A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially.",

Discogram at L5‑S1  \n\nANESTHESIA: IV sedation.  \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nThe patient was taken to the Radiology Suite and lay face‑down on a special X‑ray table. X‑ray images were taken from front, side, and angled views of the lower spine from L1‑2 to L5‑S1. The back was cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nUsing an angled X‑ray view, the L5‑S1 disc was targeted. A metal marker was placed on the skin to find the best spot for the needle. A small injection of 1% lidocaine raised a small bump on the skin. An 18‑gauge needle was guided into the disc space using the X‑ray images. Then a second, 22‑gauge 6‑inch needle was inserted into the center of the disc. The same steps were repeated for the L4‑5, L3‑4, and L2‑3 discs.  \n\nA mixture of Isovue 300 (a contrast dye) and 1 gram of the antibiotic Ancef was drawn into a 10‑cc syringe. The doctor then injected this mixture into each disc one after another, without telling the patient."
