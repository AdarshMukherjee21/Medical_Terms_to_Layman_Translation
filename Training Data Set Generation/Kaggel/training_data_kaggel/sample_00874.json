  "medical": "CONSULT FOR PROSTATE CANCER The patient returned for consultation for his newly diagnosed prostate cancer. The options including radical prostatectomy with or without nerve sparing were discussed with him with the risks of bleeding, infection, rectal injury, impotence, and incontinence. These were discussed at length. Alternative therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement, conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence were discussed also. There is a risk of rectal fistula. Hormonal therapy is usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency. Potency may not recover after the hormone therapy has been completed. Cryosurgery was discussed with the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and impotency. There is a risk of rectal fistula. He would need to have a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately. Prostate surgery to relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a higher risk of urinary incontinence. Observation therapy was discussed with him in addition. I answered all questions that were put to me and I think he understands the options that are available. I spoke with the patient for over 60 minutes concerning these options.",
  "layman": "**Consultation for Prostate Cancer**\n\nThe patient came back to discuss his newly diagnosed prostate cancer. We talked about the main treatment options and the possible side effects.\n\n**Surgery (radical prostatectomy)**  \nWe explained that the surgery can be done with or without nerve‑sparing. The risks include bleeding, infection, damage to the rectum, loss of sexual function (impotence), and loss of bladder control (incontinence). We spent a lot of time going over these risks.\n\n**Radiation therapy**  \nWe discussed several types of radiation:  \n- Radioactive seed placement  \n- Conformal external beam radiation  \n- High‑dose‑rate (HDR) radiation  \n\nThe risks for these treatments are damage to the bladder, bowel, or rectum, possible impotence, and a chance of a rectal fistula. Hormonal therapy is often added to radiation. Hormonal therapy can cause bone loss (osteoporosis), breast enlargement (gynecomastia), hot flashes, and impotence. Sexual function may not return after the hormone therapy ends.\n\n**Cryosurgery**  \nWe talked about freezing the prostate. Risks include difficulty urinating (urinary retention), narrowing of the urethra (stricture), loss of bladder control, and impotence. A rectal fistula can also occur. The patient would need a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and might have to learn how to do self‑intermittent catheterization if he can’t urinate on his own. If surgery is needed later to relieve blockage after seeds or cryosurgery, the risk of incontinence is higher.\n\n**Observation (active surveillance)**  \nWe also mentioned the option of simply monitoring the cancer without immediate treatment.\n\nI answered all of the patient’s questions and believe he understands the available choices. The discussion lasted more than 60 minutes."
