  "medical": "CC: Falls. HX: This 51y/o RHF fell four times on 1/3/93, because her &quot;legs suddenly gave out.&quot; She subsequently noticed weakness involving the right leg, and often required the assistance of her arms to move it. During some of these episodes she appeared mildly pale and felt generally weak; her husband would give her 3 teaspoons of sugar and she would appear to improve, thought not completely. During one episode she held her RUE in an &quot;odd fisted posture.&quot; She denied any other focal weakness, sensory change, dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia or alteration of consciousness. She did not seek medical attention despite her weakness. Then, last night, 1/4/93, she fell again ,and because her weakness did not subsequently improve she came to UIHC for evaluation on 1/5/93. MEDS: Micronase 5mg qd, HCTZ, quit ASA 6 months ago (tired of taking it). PMH: 1)DM type 2, dx 6 months ago. 2)HTN. 3)DJD. 4)s/p Vitrectomy and retinal traction OU for retinal detachment 7/92. 5) s/p Cholecystemomy,1968. 6) Cataract implant, OU,1992. 7) s/p C-section. FHX: Grand Aunt (stroke), MG (CAD), Mother (CAD, died MI age 63), Father (with unknown CA), Sisters (HTN), No DM in relatives. SHX: Married, lives with husband, 4 children alive and well. Denied tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. ROS: intermittent diarrhea for 20 years. EXAM: BP164/82 HR64 RR18 36.0C MS: A & O to person, place, time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Intact naming, comprehension, reading. CN: Pupils 4.5 (irregular)/4.0 (irregular) and virtually fixed. Optic disks flat. EOM intact. VFFTC. Right lower facial weakness. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE with some question of breakaway. LE: HF and HE 4+/5, KF5/5, AF and AE 5/5. Normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: intact PP/VIB/PROP/LT/T/graphesthesia. Coord: slowed FNF and HKS (worse on right). Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign. Gait: Unsteady wide-based gait. Unable to heel walk on right. Reflexes: 2/2+ throughout (Slightly more brisk on right). Plantar responses were downgoing bilaterally. HEENT: N0 Carotid or cranial bruits. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: CBC, GS (including glucose), PT/PTT, EKG, CXR on admission, 1/5/93, were unremarkable. HCT, 1/5/93, revealed a hypodensity in the left caudate consistent with ischemic change. Carotid Duplex: 0-15%RICA, 16-49%LICA; antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed borderline LV hypertrophy and normal LV function. No valvular abnormalities or thrombus were seen. The patient's history and exam findings of right facial and RLE weakness with sparing of the RUE would invoke a RACA territory stroke with recurrent artery of Heubner involvement causing the facial weakness.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Falls.  \n**History of Present Illness:** A 51‑year‑old woman with right‑hand heart failure fell four times on January 3, 1993 because her “legs suddenly gave out.” After the falls she noticed weakness in her right leg and often had to use her arms to move it. During some episodes she looked a little pale and felt weak; her husband gave her 3 teaspoons of sugar and she seemed to get better, but not fully. One time she held her right upper arm in an “odd fisted posture.” She denied any other weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, double vision, trouble swallowing, or changes in consciousness. She did not go to the doctor until the night of January 4, 1993, when she fell again and her weakness did not improve, so she came to UIHC on January 5, 1993.  \n\n**Medications:** Micronase 5 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide, stopped aspirin 6 months ago (tired of taking it).  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1. Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 6 months ago.  \n2. High blood pressure.  \n3. Degenerative joint disease.  \n4. Surgery for retinal detachment in both eyes (vitrectomy) in July 1992.  \n5. Gallbladder removal in 1968.  \n6. Cataract surgery in both eyes in 1992.  \n7. C‑section delivery.  \n\n**Family History:** Grand aunt had a stroke; mother and brother had coronary artery disease; mother died of a heart attack at 63; father has an unknown cancer; sisters have high blood pressure. No family history of diabetes.  \n\n**Social History:** Married, lives with husband, has four healthy children. Does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.  \n\n**Review of Systems:** Intermittent diarrhea for 20 years.  \n\n**Physical Exam (January 5, 1993):**  \n- Blood pressure 164/82 mm Hg, heart rate 64, breathing 18/min, temperature 36.0 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, time.  \n- Speech fluent, no slurring.  \n- Naming, understanding, reading normal.  \n- Eye exam: pupils 4.5 mm (irregular) and 4.0 mm (irregular), almost fixed. Optic discs flat. Eye movements normal. Vision normal.  \n- Right lower facial weakness.  \n- Upper body strength 5/5 on both sides, some difficulty breaking a grip.  \n- Lower body: hip and knee 4+/5, ankle 5/5, foot and ankle 5/5. Muscle bulk and tone normal.  \n- Sensation normal to pain, vibration, proprioception, light touch, temperature, and graphesthesia.  \n- Coordination slowed on finger‑to‑nose and heel‑to‑shin tests, worse on the right.  \n- No pronator drift or balance problems on Romberg test.  \n- Gait unsteady, wide‑based; cannot heel‑walk on the right.  \n- Reflexes 2/2+ everywhere, slightly brisker on the right. Plantar responses downwards on both feet.  \n- Head, ears, nose, throat normal; no carotid or cranial bruits.  \n- General exam normal.  \n\n**Course:**  \n- Blood count, basic metabolic panel (including glucose), clotting tests, ECG, chest X‑ray on admission were normal.  \n- Hematocrit on January 5 showed a low density area in the left caudate nucleus, consistent with an old stroke.  \n- Carotid ultrasound: 0‑15% narrowing of the right internal carotid, 16‑49% narrowing of the left internal carotid; normal forward flow in both vertebral arteries.  \n- Echocardiogram: borderline left ventricular thickening, normal pumping, no valve problems or clots.  \n\nThe patient’s right facial and right leg weakness, with no weakness in the right arm, suggests a stroke in the right anterior cerebral artery territory, involving the artery of Heubner, which explains the facial weakness."
