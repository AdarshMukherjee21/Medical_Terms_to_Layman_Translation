  "medical": "EXAM: Ultrasound Abdomen. REASON FOR EXAM: Elevated liver function tests. INTERPRETATION: The liver demonstrates heterogeneously increased echotexture with significant fatty infiltration. The gallbladder is surgically absent. There is no fluid collection in the cholecystectomy bed. There is dilatation of the common bile duct up to 1 cm. There is also dilatation of the pancreatic duct that measures up to 3 mm. There is caliectasis in the right kidney. The bladder is significantly distended measuring 937 cc in volume. The caliectasis in the right kidney may be secondary to back pressure from the distended bladder. The aorta is normal in caliber. IMPRESSION: 1. Dilated common duct as well as pancreatic duct as described. Given the dilatation of these two ducts, ERCP versus MRCP is recommended to exclude obstructing mass. The findings could reflect changes of cholecystectomy. 2. Significantly distended bladder with probably resultant caliectasis in the right kidney. Clinical correlation recommended.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Ultrasound of the abdomen.  \nREASON FOR EXAM: High liver enzyme levels.  \n\nINTERPRETATION: The liver looks uneven and has a lot of fat. The gallbladder has been removed. There is no fluid where the gallbladder used to be. The common bile duct is widened to about 1 cm. The pancreatic duct is also widened, measuring about 3 mm. The right kidney shows some swelling of its tubes (caliectasis). The bladder is very full, holding about 937 cc of urine. The swelling in the right kidney may be caused by the pressure from the full bladder. The aorta looks normal.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. The common bile duct and pancreatic duct are widened. Because of this, a procedure called ERCP or an MRCP scan is suggested to check for a possible blockage. These changes could be related to the gallbladder removal.  \n2. The bladder is very full, which likely caused the swelling in the right kidney. Further clinical evaluation is recommended."
