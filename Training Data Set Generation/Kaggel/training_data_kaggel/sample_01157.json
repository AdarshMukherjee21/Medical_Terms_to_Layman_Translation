  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bladder cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bladder cancer. OPERATION: Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), large. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented to the hospital with renal insufficiency, syncopal episodes. The patient was stabilized from cardiac standpoint on a renal ultrasound. The patient was found to have a bladder mass. The patient does have a history of bladder cancer. Options were watchful waiting, resection of the bladder tumor were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE were discussed. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAILS OF THE OR: The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder. The entire bladder was visualized, which appeared to have a large tumor, lateral to the right ureteral opening. There was a significant papillary superficial fluffiness around the left ________. There was a periureteral diverticulum, lateral to the left ureteral opening. There were moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder. There were no stones. Using a French cone tip catheter, bilateral pyelograms were obtained, which appeared normal. Subsequently, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope a resection of the bladder tumor was performed all the way up to the base. Deep biopsies were sent separately. Coagulation was performed around the periphery and at the base of the tumor. All the tumors were removed and sent for path analysis. There was an excellent hemostasis. The rest of the bladder appeared normal. There was no further evidence of tumor. At the end of the procedure, a 22 three-way catheter was placed, and the patient was brought to the recovery in a stable condition.",

He was treated for heart issues and had a kidney ultrasound. A bladder mass was found. He already had a history of bladder cancer. We talked about watching the tumor, removing it, and the risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, heart attack, blood clots, and lung problems. He understood all the risks and chose to have the surgery.\n\n**Details of the operation:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia. He was positioned on his back with his legs raised (dorsal lithotomy). The area was cleaned and covered in a sterile way. A 23‑French scope was inserted through the urethra into the bladder. The whole bladder was seen and a large tumor was found next to the right ureter opening. There was also a lot of small, papillary growth around the left side. A small pouch of bladder (diverticulum) was seen next to the left ureter opening. The bladder walls had moderate thickening (trabeculations). No stones were present. Using a special catheter, images of both kidneys were taken and looked normal. Then a 24‑French cutting loop resectoscope was used to remove the tumor all the way to its base. Separate deep tissue samples were taken for biopsy. The area around the tumor and its base was coagulated to stop bleeding. All tumor pieces were removed and sent for pathology. Bleeding was well controlled. The rest of the bladder looked normal and there was no more tumor seen. At the end, a 22‑French three‑way catheter was placed. The patient was moved to recovery in stable condition."
