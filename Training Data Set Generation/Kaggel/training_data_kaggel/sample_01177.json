Excision of abscess, removal of foreign body. 2. Repair of incisional hernia. ANESTHESIA: LMA. INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 37-year-old gentleman who has had multiple procedures including a laparotomy related to trauma. The patient has had a recurrently infected cyst of his mass at the superior aspect of his incision, which he says gets larger and then it drains internally, causing him to be quite ill. He presented to my office and I recommended that he undergo exploration of this area and removal. The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery. FINDINGS: The patient was found upon excision of the cyst that it contained a large Prolene suture, which is multiply knotted as it always is; beneath this was a very small incisional hernia, the hernia cavity, which contained omentum; the hernia was easily repaired. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of an LMA anesthetic, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion. The puncta of the wound lesion was infiltrated with methylene blue and peroxide. The lesion was excised and the existing scar was excised using an ellipse and using a tenotomy scissors, the cyst was excised down to its base. In doing so, we identified a large Prolene suture within the wound and followed this cyst down to its base at which time we found that it contained omentum and was in fact overlying a small incisional hernia. The cyst was removed in its entirety, divided from the omentum using a Metzenbaum and tying with 2-0 silk ties. The hernia repair was undertaken with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture with simple sutures. The wound was then irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular and Steri-Strips. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Dressings were applied and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",

An incisional hernia.  \n\nPROCEDURES  \n1. Removed the abscess and the foreign object.  \n2. Fixed the incisional hernia.  \n\nANESTHESIA: Laryngeal mask airway (LMA).  \n\nINDICATIONS:  \nThe patient is a friendly 37‑year‑old man who has had several surgeries, including a large abdominal incision from a previous injury. He has a cyst near the top of that incision that keeps getting infected, gets bigger, and then drains on its own, making him feel very sick. He came to my office and we talked about exploring the area and removing the cyst. We discussed the purpose of the surgery, the risks, the expected benefits, possible complications, and other treatment options. He agreed to have the operation.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \nDuring the surgery, we found that the cyst contained a large Prolene suture that was knotted, as it usually is. Inside the cyst was a small incisional hernia that held omentum (fatty tissue from the abdomen). The hernia was easy to repair.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was identified and taken to the operating room. After placing the LMA for anesthesia, his abdomen was cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes. The opening of the wound was marked with methylene blue and hydrogen peroxide. We removed the cyst and the surrounding scar using an elliptical shape and tenotomy scissors, cutting down to the base of the cyst. While doing this, we found the large Prolene suture inside the wound and followed the cyst to its base, where we discovered omentum and the small hernia. The cyst was removed completely, separated from the omentum with a Metzenbaum scissors, and tied off with 2‑0 silk sutures. The hernia was repaired with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The wound was washed clean and closed with 3‑0 Vicryl for the deep layer, 4‑0 Vicryl for the skin, and Steri‑Strips. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Dressings were applied and he was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
