  "medical": "EPIDIDYMECTOMY OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the supine position and prepped and draped in the usual manner. A transverse scrotal incision was made and carried down to the tunica vaginalis, which was opened. A small amount of clear fluid was expressed. The tunica vaginalis was opened and the testicle was brought out through this incision. The epididymis was separated off the surface of the testicle using a scalpel. With blunt and sharp dissection, the epididymis was dissected off the testicle. Bovie was used for hemostasis. The vessels going to the testicle were preserved without any obvious injury, and a nice viable testicle was present after the epididymis was removed from this. The blood supply to the epididymis was cauterized using a Bovie and the vas was divided with cautery also. There was no obvious bleeding. The cord was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, as was the dartos tissue in the scrotum. The testicle was replaced in the scrotum. Skin was closed in two layers using 3-0 chromic catgut for the dartos and a subcuticular closure with the same material. A dry sterile dressing and compression were applied, and he was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "**Epididymectomy Operative Note (Simplified)**  \nThe patient lay on their back. The area was cleaned and covered in the usual way. A horizontal cut was made in the scrotum and cut down to the thin covering around the testicle (tunica vaginalis). A little clear fluid came out. The covering was opened and the testicle was pulled out through the cut. The epididymis (the tube on the testicle) was carefully separated from the testicle with a scalpel and then with gentle and sharp cuts. A small electric cautery device (Bovie) was used to stop any bleeding. The blood vessels to the testicle were kept intact and the testicle looked healthy after the epididymis was removed. The blood supply to the epididymis was cauterized with the Bovie, and the vas deferens (the tube that carries sperm) was also cut with cautery. No obvious bleeding was seen. The spermatic cord and the scrotal skin were numbed with 0.25% Marcaine. The testicle was put back into the scrotum. The skin was closed in two layers: the inner layer with 3‑0 chromic catgut for the dartos muscle, and the outer layer with a subcuticular stitch using the same material. A dry sterile dressing and compression bandage were applied. The patient was sent to recovery in stable condition."
