Allograft, structural at C5-C6. 9. Allograft, structural at C6-C7. ANESTHESIA: General. PREOPERATIVE NOTE: This patient is a 47-year-old male with chief complaint of severe neck pain and left upper extremity numbness and weakness. Preoperative MRI scan showed evidence of herniated nucleus pulposus at C5-C6 and C6-C7 on the left. The patient has failed epidural steroid injections. Risks and benefits of the above procedure were discussed with the patient including bleeding, infection, muscle loss, nerve damage, paralysis, and death. OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient was taken to the OR and placed in the supine position. After general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient's neck was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A horizontal incision was made on the left side of the neck at the level of the C6 vertebral body. It was taken down through the subcutaneous tissues exposing the platysmus muscle. The platysmus muscle was incised along the skin incision and the deep cervical fascia was bluntly dissected down to the anterior cervical spine. An #18 gauge needle was placed in the C5-C6 interspace and the intraoperative x-ray confirmed that this was the appropriate level. Next, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally on both the right and left side, and then a complete anterior cervical discectomy was performed. The disk was very degenerated and brown in color. There was an acute disk herniation through posterior longitudinal ligament. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and a bilateral foraminotomy was performed. Approximately, 5 mm of the nerve root on both the right and left side was visualized. A ball-ended probe could be passed up the foramen. Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo. The end plates of C5 and C6 were prepared using a high-speed burr and a 6-mm lordotic machined allograft was malleted into place. There was good bony apposition both proximally and distally. Next, attention was placed at the C6-C7 level. Again, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally and a complete anterior cervical discectomy at C6-C7 was performed. The disk was degenerated and there was acute disk herniation in the posterior longitudinal ligament on the left. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed. A bilateral foraminotomy was performed. Approximately, 5 mm of the C7 nerve root was visualized on both sides. A micro nerve hook was able to be passed up the foramen easily. Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo. The end plates at C6-C7 were then prepared using a high-speed burr and then a 7-mm machined lordotic allograft was malleted into place. There was good bony apposition, both proximally and distally. Next, a 44-mm Blackstone low-profile anterior cervical plate was applied to the anterior cervical spine with six 14 mm screws. Intraoperative x-ray confirmed appropriate positioning of the plate and the graft. The wound was then copiously irrigated with normal saline and bacitracin. There was no active bleeding upon closure of the wound. A small drain was placed deep. The platysmal muscle was closed with 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with #4-0 Monocryl. Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied. The patient was monitored throughout the procedure with free-running EMGs and SSEPs and there were no untoward events. The patient was awoken and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",

Herniated disc at the C5‑C6 level.  \n2. Herniated disc at the C6‑C7 level.  \n\n**Procedure performed**  \n1. Removed pressure from the front of the neck at C5‑C6.  \n2. Removed pressure from the front of the neck at C6‑C7.  \n3. Added metal rods to the front of the spine.  \n4. Joined the front of the spine at C5‑C6.  \n5.

Added a structural bone graft at C6‑C7.  \n\n**Anesthesia**  \nGeneral anesthesia (the patient was asleep).  \n\n**Pre‑operative note**  \nThe patient is a 47‑year‑old man who has severe neck pain and numbness and weakness in his left arm. An MRI before surgery showed herniated discs at C5‑C6 and C6‑C7 on the left side. He has already had steroid injections that did not help. The risks and benefits of the surgery were explained, including bleeding, infection, muscle loss, nerve damage, paralysis, and death.  \n\n**Operative report**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. After general anesthesia was started, the neck was cleaned and covered. A horizontal cut was made on the left side of the neck at the level of the C6 vertebra. The cut went through the skin, fat, and the platysma muscle. The deep neck tissue was carefully separated to reach the front of the spine.  \n\nA small needle was placed at the C5‑C6 space and an X‑ray confirmed the correct level. The longus colli muscles were moved aside on both sides, and the disc was removed. The disc was very worn and brown. A herniated part of the disc had pushed through the back ligament. That ligament was removed and the openings where the nerves exit (foramina) were widened on both sides. About 5 mm of the nerve root on each side could be seen, and a probe could pass through the opening. Bleeding was stopped with cautery and a hemostatic spray. The bone ends of C5 and C6 were shaped with a high‑speed drill and a 6‑mm curved bone graft was pressed into place. The graft fit well on both ends.  \n\nThe same steps were repeated at the C6‑C7 level. The disc was removed, the back ligament was taken out, and the openings were widened. About 5 mm of the C7 nerve root was visible on each side. Bleeding was controlled the same way. The bone ends at C6‑C7 were shaped and a 7‑mm curved graft was placed.  \n\nA 44‑mm low‑profile metal plate was attached to the front of the spine with six 14‑mm screws. An X‑ray confirmed the plate and graft were in the right position. The wound was washed thoroughly with saline and antibiotic solution. No active bleeding was seen when the wound was closed. A small drain was put in. The platysma muscle was stitched with 3‑0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with 4‑0 Monocryl. A skin adhesive and strips were applied.  \n\nThroughout the surgery the patient’s nerves were monitored with EMG and SSEPs, and no problems occurred. The patient woke up and was taken to the recovery room in good condition."
