  "medical": "CC: Seizure D/O HX: 29 y/o male with cerebral palsy, non-shunted hydrocephalus, spastic quadriplegia, mental retardation, bilateral sensory neural hearing loss, severe neurogenic scoliosis and multiple contractures of the 4 extremities, neurogenic bowel and bladder incontinence, and a history of seizures. He was seen for evaluation of seizures which first began at age 27 years, two years before presentation. His typical episodes consist of facial twitching (side not specified), unresponsive pupils, and moaning. The episodes last approximately 1-2 minutes in duration and are followed by post-ictal fatigue. He was placed on DPH, but there was no record of an EEG prior to presentation. He had had no seizure events in over 1 year prior to presentation while on DPH 100mg--O--200mg. He also complained of headaches for the past 10 years. BIRTH HX: Spontaneous Vaginal delivery at 36weeks gestation to a G2P1 mother. Birth weight 7#10oz. No instrumentation required. Labor = 11hours. &quot;Light gas anesthesia&quot; given. Apgars unknown. Mother reportedly had the &quot;flu&quot; in the 7th or 8th month of gestation. Patient discharged 5 days post-partum. Development: spoke first words between 1 and 2 years of age. Rolled side to side at age 2, but did not walk. Fed self with hands at age 2 years. Never toilet trained. PMH: 1)Hydrocephalus manifested by macrocephaly by age 2-3 months. Head circumference 50.5cm at 4 months of age (wide sutures and bulging fontanels). Underwent ventriculogram, age 4 months, which illustrated massive enlargement of the lateral ventricles and normal sized aqueduct and 4th ventricle. The cortex of the cerebral hemisphere was less than 1cm. in thickness; especially in the occipital regions where only a thin rim of tissue was left. Neurosurgical intervention was not attempted and the patient deemed inoperable at the time. By 31 months of age the patients head circumference was 68cm, at which point the head size arrested. Other problems mentioned above. SHX: institutionalized at age 18 years. FHX: unremarkable. EXAM: Vitals unknown. MS: awake with occasional use of intelligible but inappropriately used words. CN: Rightward beating nystagmus increase on leftward gaze. Right gaze preference. Corneal responses were intact bilaterally. Fundoscopic exam not noted. Motor: spastic quadriparesis. moves RUE more than other extremities. Sensory: withdrew to PP in 4 extremities. Coord: ND Station: ND Gait: ND, wheel chair bound. Reflexes: RUE 2+, LUE 3+, RLE 4+ with sustained cross adductor clonus in the right quadriceps. LLE 3+. Other: Macrocephaly (measurement not given). Scoliosis. Rest of general exam unremarkable except for numerous abdominal scars. COURSE: EEG 8/26/92: Abnormal with diffuse slowing and depressed background (left worse than right) and poorly formed background activity at 5-7hz. Right posterior sharp transients, and rhythmic delta-theta bursts from the right temporal region. The findings are consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction and underlying seizure tendency of multifocal origin.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Seizures  \n**History of present illness:** A 29‑year‑old man with many long‑term medical problems—cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus that was never shunted, severe muscle stiffness in all four limbs, intellectual disability, hearing loss in both ears, very bad scoliosis, and tight muscles in all limbs—has had seizures for the last two years. He first noticed them at age 27. When they happen, he has facial twitching (we don’t know which side), his pupils don’t react, and he moans. The seizures last about 1–2 minutes and are followed by tiredness. He has been taking DPH (a medication) but there is no record of an EEG before he came in. He had not had a seizure in more than a year while on DPH 100–200 mg. He also says he has had headaches for the last 10 years.\n\n**Birth history:** Born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 36 weeks to a mother who had been pregnant twice and had given birth once. Birth weight was 7 lb 10 oz. No instruments were used. Labor lasted 11 hours. The mother received “light gas anesthesia.” Apgar scores are unknown. She had the flu in the 7th or 8th month of pregnancy. The baby was discharged 5 days after birth.\n\n**Development:** He said his first words between ages 1 and 2. He rolled from side to side at age 2 but never walked. He could feed himself with his hands at age 2. He was never toilet trained.\n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. **Hydrocephalus** – He had a big head (macrocephaly) by 2–3 months. At 4 months his head was 50.5 cm, with wide sutures and bulging soft spots. A ventriculogram at 4 months showed huge lateral ventricles, normal aqueduct and 4th ventricle, and a very thin cerebral cortex (less than 1 cm, especially in the back of the head). Surgery was not done because it was considered too risky. By 31 months his head was 68 cm and the growth stopped.  \n2. Other problems listed above.  \n**Social history:** He lived in an institution starting at age 18.  \n**Family history:** Unremarkable.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Vitals not recorded.  \n- He is awake and sometimes uses words, but they are not always correct.  \n- **Eyes:** He has right‑ward beating nystagmus that gets worse when looking left. He prefers to look right. Corneal reflexes are normal. No eye exam details.  \n- **Motor:** Very stiff in all four limbs. He moves his right arm more than the others.  \n- **Sensory:** He withdraws when pinched in all four limbs.  \n- **Coordination:** Not tested.  \n- **Gait:** Not tested; he uses a wheelchair.  \n- **Reflexes:** Right arm 2+, left arm 3+, right leg 4+ with sustained clonus in the right quadriceps, left leg 3+.  \n- **Other:** He has a big head (size not measured). He has scoliosis. The rest of the exam is normal except for many abdominal scars.\n\n**Course:** An EEG on 8/26/92 showed abnormal brain waves with slow activity and a low background, worse on the left side. There were sharp waves in the right back part of the brain and rhythmic slow waves from the right temporal area. These findings suggest overall brain dysfunction and a tendency for seizures coming from multiple spots."
