  "medical": "CC: Difficulty with word finding. HX: This 27y/o RHF experienced sudden onset word finding difficulty and slurred speech on the evening of 2/19/96. She denied any associated dysphagia, diplopia, numbness or weakness of her extremities. She went to sleep with her symptoms on 2/19/96, and awoke with them on 2/20/96. She also awoke with a headache (HA) and mild neck stiffness. She took a shower and her HA and neck stiffness resolved. Throughout the day she continued to have difficulty with word finding and had worsening of her slurred speech. That evening, she began to experience numbness and weakness in the lower right face. She felt like there was a &quot;rubber-band&quot; wrapped around her tongue. For 3 weeks prior to presentation, she experienced transient episodes of a &quot;boomerang&quot; shaped field cut in the left eye. The episodes were not associated with any other symptoms. One week prior to presentation, she went to a local ER for menorrhagia. She had just resumed taking oral birth control pills one week prior to the ER visit after having stopped their use for several months. Local evaluation included an unremarkable carotid duplex scan. However, a HCT with and without contrast reportedly revealed a left frontal gyriform enhancing lesion. An MRI brain scan on 2/20/96 revealed nonspecific white matter changes in the right periventricular region. EEG reportedly showed diffuse slowing. CRP was reportedly &quot;too high&quot; to calibrate. MEDS: Ortho-Novum 7-7-7 (started 2/3/96), and ASA (started 2/20/96). PMH: 1)ventral hernia repair 10 years ago, 2)mild &quot;concussion&quot; suffered during a MVA; without loss of consciousness, 5/93, 3) Anxiety disorder, 4) One childbirth. FHX: She did not know her father and was not in contact with her mother. SHX: Lives with boyfriend. Smokes one pack of cigarettes every three days and has done so for 10 years. Consumes 6 bottles of beers, one day a week. Unemployed and formerly worked at an herbicide plant. EXAM: BP150/79, HR77, RR22, 37.4C. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was dysarthric with mild decreased fluency marked by occasional phonemic paraphasic errors. Comprehension, naming and reading were intact. She was able to repeat, though her repetition was occasionally marked by phonemic paraphasic errors. She had no difficulty with calculation. CN: VFFTC, Pupils 5/5 decreasing to 3/3. EOM intact. No papilledema or hemorrhages seen on fundoscopy. No RAPD or INO. There was right lower facial weakness. Facial sensation was intact, bilaterally. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: No deficits. Coord/Station/Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: CRP 1.2 (elevated), ESR 10, RF 20, ANA 1:40, ANCA &lt;1:40, TSH 2.0, FT4 1.73, Anticardiolipin antibody IgM 10.8GPL units (normal &lt;10.9), Anticardiolipin antibody IgG 14.8GPL (normal&lt;22.9), SSA and SSB were normal. Urine beta-hCG pregnancy and drug screen were negative. EKG, CXR and UA were negative. MRI brain, 2/21/96 revealed increased signal on T2 imaging in the periventricular white matter region of the right hemisphere. In addition, there were subtle T2 signal changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal regions as seen previously on her local MRI can. In addition, special FLAIR imaging showed increased signal in the right frontal region consistent with ischemia. She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 2/22/96. This revealed decreased flow and vessel narrowing the candelabra branches of the RMCA supplying the right frontal lobe. These changes corresponded to the areas of ischemic changes seen on MRI. There was also segmental narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of Willis. There was a small aneurysm at the origin of the LPCA. There was narrowing in the supraclinoid portion of the RICA and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The study was highly suggestive of vasculitis. 2/23/96, Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed no evidence of retinal vasculitic change. Neuropsychologic testing the same day revealed slight impairment of complex attention only. She was started on Prednisone 60mg qd and Tagamet 400mg qhs. On 2/26/96, she underwent a right frontal brain biopsy. Pathologic evaluation revealed evidence of focal necrosis (stroke/infarct), but no evidence of vasculitis. Immediately following the brain biopsy, while still in the recovery room, she experienced sudden onset right hemiparesis and transcortical motor type aphasia. Initial HCT was unremarkable. An EEG was consistent with a focal lesion in the left hemisphere. However, a 2/28/96 MRI brain scan revealed new increased signal on T2 weighted images in a gyriform pattern from the left precentral gyrus to the superior frontal gyrus. This was felt consistent with vasculitis. She began q2month cycles of Cytoxan (1,575mg IV on 2/29/96. She became pregnant after her 4th cycle of Cytoxan, despite warnings to the contrary. After extensive discussions with OB/GYN it was recommended she abort the pregnancy. She underwent neuropsychologic testing which revealed no significant cognitive deficits. She later agreed to the abortion. She has undergone 9 cycles of Cytoxan ( one cycle every 2 months) as of 4/97. She had complained of one episode of paresthesias of the LUE in 1/97. MRI then showed no new signs ischemia.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: trouble finding words.  \n\nHistory: A 27‑year‑old woman had sudden trouble finding words and slurred speech on the evening of February 19, 1996. She had no trouble swallowing, double vision, numbness, or weakness in her arms or legs. She went to bed with the symptoms and woke the next morning with the same problems, plus a headache and mild neck stiffness. The headache and stiffness went away after a shower, but her word‑finding difficulty and slurred speech got worse during the day. That evening she also felt numbness and weakness in the lower part of her right face and described a “rubber‑band” feeling around her tongue. For the three weeks before she came to the hospital she had brief episodes of a “boomerang‑shaped” visual field loss in her left eye, with no other symptoms. A week earlier she had gone to a local emergency room for heavy menstrual bleeding after restarting birth‑control pills, which she had stopped for several months. The local doctor did a carotid duplex scan that was normal, but a CT scan with and without contrast showed a left frontal brain lesion that looked like a ring. A brain MRI on February 20, 1996, showed nonspecific white‑matter changes in the right side of the brain. An EEG showed diffuse slowing. Her C‑reactive protein (CRP) was too high to measure accurately. Medications started were Ortho‑Novum 7‑7‑7 (started February 3, 1996) and aspirin (started February 20, 1996).  \n\nPast medical history: a ventral hernia repair 10 years ago, a mild concussion from a car accident in May 1993 with no loss of consciousness, an anxiety disorder, and one childbirth. Family history: she did not know her father and had no contact with her mother.  \n\nSocial history: she lives with her boyfriend, smokes one pack of cigarettes every three days for 10 years, drinks six beers once a week, is unemployed, and used to work at a herbicide plant.  \n\nExamination: blood pressure 150/79, heart rate 77, respiratory rate 22, temperature 37.4 °C. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her speech was slurred with occasional sound errors; she could understand, name, read, and repeat words, though sometimes with errors. She had no trouble doing math. Cranial nerves: normal facial sensation, but weakness in the lower right side of her face. The rest of the cranial nerve exam was normal. Motor strength was 5/5 everywhere, with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensation was normal. Coordination, balance, and gait were normal. Reflexes were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor on both sides. General exam was normal.  \n\nCourse: CRP 1.2 mg/dL (elevated), ESR 10, rheumatoid factor 20, ANA 1:40, ANCA <1:40, thyroid‑stimulating hormone 2.0, free T4 1.73, anticardiolipin IgM 10.8 GPL (normal <10.9), IgG 14.8 GPL (normal <22.9), SSA and SSB were normal. Urine pregnancy test and drug screen were negative. ECG, chest X‑ray, and urinalysis were normal. A brain MRI on February 21, 1996, showed increased signal in the right periventricular white matter and subtle changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal areas, consistent with small areas of ischemia. A cerebral angiogram on February 22, 1996, showed reduced blood flow and narrowing of the branches of the right middle cerebral artery that supply the right frontal lobe, as well as narrowing in the circle of Willis, a small aneurysm at the origin of the left posterior cerebral artery, and narrowing of the right internal carotid artery and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The findings suggested vasculitis.  \n\nOn February 23, 1996, a neuro‑ophthalmology exam found no retinal inflammation, and neuropsychological testing showed only a slight problem with complex attention. She was started on prednisone 60 mg daily and ranitidine 400 mg at bedtime.  \n\nOn February 26, 1996, she had a right frontal brain biopsy. The pathology showed a small area of dead tissue (stroke) but no evidence of vasculitis. Immediately after the biopsy, while still in recovery, she developed sudden weakness on the right side of her body and a type of speech difficulty called transcortical motor aphasia. A CT scan was normal, but an EEG suggested a focal left‑hemisphere lesion. A follow‑up MRI on February 28, 1996, showed new increased signal in a ring‑like pattern from the left precentral gyrus to the superior frontal gyrus, again suggesting vasculitis.  \n\nShe began treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 1,575 mg IV every two months, starting February 29, 1996. After her fourth cycle she became pregnant, despite warnings that the drug could harm a fetus. After discussions with her OB‑GYN, she was advised to terminate the pregnancy. Neuropsychological testing then showed no major cognitive problems, and she agreed to the abortion. As of April 1997 she had completed nine cycles of Cytoxan (one every two months). In January 1997 she reported one episode of tingling in her left upper arm; a subsequent MRI showed no new signs of ischemia."
