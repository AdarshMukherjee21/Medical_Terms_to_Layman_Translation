  "medical": "CC: Fall/loss of consciousness. HX: This 44y/o male fell 15-20feet from a construction site scaffold landing on his head on a cement sidewalk. He was transported directly from the scene, approximately one mile east of UIHC. The patient developed labored breathing and an EMT attempted to intubate the patient in the UIHC ER garage, but upon evaluation in the ER, was found to be in his esophagus and was immediately replaced into the trachea. Replacement of the ET tube required succinylcholine. The patient remained in a C-collar during the procedure. Once in the ER the patient had a 15min period of bradycardia. MEDS: none prior to accident. PMH: No significant chronic or recent illness. s/p left knee arthroplasty. h/o hand fractures. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Married. Rare cigarette use/Occasional Marijuana use/Social ETOH use per wife. EXAM: BP156/79. HR 74 RR (Ambu Bag ventilation via ET tube) 34.7C 72-100% O2Sat. MS: Unresponsive to verbal stimulation. No spontaneous verbalization. CN: Does not open/close eyes to command or spontaneously. Pupils 9/7 and nonreactive. Corneas -/+. Gag +/+. Oculocephalic and Oculovestibular reflexes not performed. Motor: minimal spontaneous movement of the 4 extremities. Sensory: withdraws LUE and BLE to noxious stimulation. Coord/Station/Gait: Not tested. Reflexes: 1-2+ and symmetric throughout. Babinski signs were present bilaterally. HEENT: severe facial injury with brain parenchyma and blood from the right nostril. Severe soft tissue swelling about side of head. Gen Exam: CV: RRR without murmur. Lungs: CTA. Abdomen: distended after ET tube misplacement. COURSE: HCT upon arrival, 10/29/92, revealed: Extensive parenchymal contusions in right fronto-parietal area. Pronounced diffuse brain swelling seemingly obliterates the mesencephalic cistern and 4th ventricle. Considerable mass effect is exerted upon the right lateral ventricle, near totally obliterating its contour. Massive subcutaneous soft tissue swelling is present along the right anterolateral parietal area. There are extensive fractures of the following: two component horizontal fractures throughout the floor of the right middle cranial fossa which includes the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone, as well as the greater wing of the sphenoid. Comminuted fractures of the aqueous portion of the temporal bone and parietal bone is noted on the right. Extensive comminution of the right half of the frontal bone and marked displacement is seen. Comminuted fractures of the medial wall of the right orbit and ethmoidal air cells is seen with near total opacification of the air cells. The medial and lateral walls of the maxillary sinus are fractured and minimally displaced, as well as the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus. The right zygomatic bone is fractured at its articulation with the sphenoid bone and displaced posteriorly. Portable chest, c-spine and abdominal XRays were unremarkable, but limited studies. Abdominal CT was unremarkable. Hgb 10.4g/dl, Hct29%, WBC17.4k/mm3, Plt 190K. ABG:7.28/48/46 on admission. Glucose 131. The patient was hyperventilated, Mannitol was administered (1g/kg), and the patient was given a Dilantin loading dose. He was taken to surgery immediately following the above studies to decompress the contused brain and remove bony fragments from multiple skull fractures. The patient remained in a persistent vegetative state at UIHC, and upon the request of this wife his feeding tube was discontinued. He later expired.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Fell and lost consciousness.  \n\n**History:** A 44‑year‑old man fell 15–20 feet from a scaffold at a construction site and hit his head on a cement sidewalk. He was taken directly from the scene, about one mile east of UIHC. While arriving, he started breathing hard. EMTs tried to insert a breathing tube in the ER garage, but the tube was in his esophagus. In the ER the tube was moved into the trachea. This required the drug succinylcholine, a muscle relaxant. He stayed in a cervical collar during the procedure. In the ER he had a 15‑minute period of slow heart rate.  \n\n**Medications before the accident:** none.  \n**Past medical history:** no major illnesses; had a left knee replacement and had hand fractures before.  \n**Family history:** none notable.  \n**Social history:** married, smokes rarely, uses marijuana occasionally, drinks alcohol socially (according to his wife).  \n\n**Exam on arrival:**  \n- Blood pressure 156/79, heart rate 74, breathing rate 34 (bag‑valve mask through the breathing tube).  \n- Temperature 34.7 °C, oxygen saturation 72–100 %.  \n- Not responsive to talking, no speech.  \n- Eyes did not open or close on command or on their own; pupils 9 mm and 7 mm, not reacting to light.  \n- Corneas clear. Gag reflex present. Eye‑movement reflexes not tested.  \n- Small movements in all four limbs.  \n- Pulls back when the left arm and both legs are touched hard.  \n- Coordination, balance, and walking not tested.  \n- Reflexes normal and symmetrical. Babinski sign present on both sides.  \n- Head and neck: severe facial injury, brain tissue exposed, blood coming from the right nostril, large swelling on the side of the head.  \n- General exam: heart rhythm regular, no murmurs. Lungs clear. Abdomen swollen after the breathing tube was misplaced.  \n\n**Course:**  \nA head CT scan on arrival (10/29/92) showed large bruises in the right front‑back part of the brain. The brain was swollen, almost filling the space around the brainstem and the fourth ventricle. The swelling pushed on the right side of the brain’s fluid space, almost closing it. There was huge swelling under the skin on the right side of the head. The scan also showed many fractures: two horizontal fractures across the floor of the right middle skull cavity, involving parts of the temporal bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The right side of the temporal bone and parietal bone were broken into many pieces. The right half of the frontal bone was broken into many pieces and displaced. The inner wall of the right eye socket and the ethmoid air cells were broken and the air cells were almost completely filled with fluid. The walls of the right and left maxillary sinuses were fractured and slightly displaced. The right cheekbone was broken where it meets the sphenoid bone and pushed backward. Portable chest, neck, and abdominal X‑rays were normal but limited. An abdominal CT scan was normal.  \n\nBlood tests: hemoglobin 10.4 g/dl, hematocrit 29 %, white blood cells 17.4 k, platelets 190 k. Blood gas on admission: pH 7.28, pCO₂ 48, pO₂ 46. Blood glucose 131.  \n\nThe patient was made to breathe faster, given mannitol (a medication to reduce swelling) at 1 g per kg, and given a loading dose of Dilantin (an anticonvulsant). He was taken to surgery right after the scans to relieve pressure on the bruised brain and remove bone fragments from the skull fractures.  \n\nThe patient stayed in a persistent vegetative state at UIHC. At his wife’s request, his feeding tube was removed. He later died."
