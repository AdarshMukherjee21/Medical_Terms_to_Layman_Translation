  "medical": "This is a middle-aged male with increasing memory loss and history of Lyme disease. FINDINGS: There is a large intrasellar mass lesion producing diffuse expansion of the sella turcica. This mass lesions measures approximately 16 x 18 x 18mm (craniocaudal x AP x mediolateral) in size. The lesion extends into the left cavernous sinus along the inferior edge of the C3 segment of the left cavernous carotid artery obscuring the left cranial nerves III, IV and VI. The V1 and V2 branches however can be identified. There is intense enhancement of this lesion following gadolinium augmentation. There is a focal central area of nonenhancement which measures approximately 4mm in diameter. There is right-sided deviation of the infundibulum with mild convex bowing of this mass lesion into the suprasellar cistern, however, there is no impingement upon the optic chiasm. There is pressure erosion of the floor of the sella turcica bulging into the sphenoid sinus without a demonstrated cortical destruction or invasion of the sphenoid sinus. The lesion most likely represents a macroadenoma. The intense enhancement of the central area of hypointense signal raises the possibility a calcification suggesting a differential diagnosis of a late onset craniopharyngioma. The lesion is not considered consistent with a meningioma. CT imaging would be of benefit for exclusion of calcification. Normal flow within the carotid and vertebrobasilar circulation and there is no demonstrated aneurysm of the Circle of Willis. Normal cerebral hemispheres and normal cortical gray matter and white matter tracks. There are no white matter hyperintensities. There is normal enhancement of the dural sinuses and cortical veins. There is no enhancing intraaxial or extraaxial mass lesion. Normal basal ganglia and thalami. Normal internal and external capsules. Normal midbrain, pons and medulla and a normal brainstem cervical cord junction. Normal vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. Normal calvarium. There is a 1.5cm retention cyst of the posterior wall of the left maxillary antrum. The paranasal sinuses are normal. Normal temporal bones. Normal central skull base. Normal clivus and craniovertebral junction. IMPRESSION: Large intrasellar mass lesion with probable invasion of the left cavernous sinus. See above for size, morphology and pattern of enhancement. Differential considerations include a macroadenoma of the pituitary gland versus a craniopharyngioma. CT imaging is recommended for assessment of possible calcifications. Retention cyst of the left maxillary antrum. Normal supratentorial brainstem and posterior fossa.",
  "layman": "This man, in his middle age, has been losing more memory and has a history of Lyme disease.  \n\n**Findings**  \nA large tumor inside the pituitary gland (the “sella turcica”) is pressing on surrounding structures.  \n- The tumor is about 16 mm tall, 18 mm front‑to‑back, and 18 mm wide.  \n- It has pushed into the left cavernous sinus, the space that holds the left carotid artery and several cranial nerves.  \n- The tumor covers nerves III, IV, and VI, but the first two branches of the trigeminal nerve (V1 and V2) can still be seen.  \n- After a contrast dye (gadolinium) is given, the tumor lights up strongly, except for a small 4 mm center that does not enhance.  \n- The tumor slightly bends the pituitary stalk to the right and bulges upward toward the brain, but it does not press on the optic chiasm (the spot where the optic nerves cross).  \n- The bottom of the pituitary area is eroded, pushing into the sphenoid sinus, but there is no bone destruction or invasion of the sinus.  \n\nThe tumor most likely is a macroadenoma (a large pituitary adenoma).  \nThe strong enhancement of the non‑enhancing center suggests it could be a calcified area, raising the possibility of a late‑onset craniopharyngioma. It is not likely a meningioma.  \nA CT scan would help confirm whether there is calcification.  \n\nOther brain structures are normal:  \n- Blood flow in the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries is normal, with no aneurysm in the Circle of Willis.  \n- The cerebral hemispheres, gray and white matter, and major veins show no abnormalities.  \n- No white‑matter lesions or extra‑ or intra‑axial masses are seen.  \n- Basal ganglia, thalami, internal and external capsules, midbrain, pons, medulla, brainstem‑cervical junction, cerebellum, and skull bones are all normal.  \n\nThere is a 1.5 cm fluid‑filled cyst on the back wall of the left maxillary sinus.  \nThe paranasal sinuses, temporal bones, central skull base, clivus, and craniovertebral junction are all normal.  \n\n**Impression**  \nA large pituitary‑area tumor that probably extends into the left cavernous sinus.  \nKey details: size, shape, and how it enhances with contrast.  \nDifferential diagnosis: macroadenoma vs. craniopharyngioma.  \nCT imaging is recommended to look for calcification.  \nAlso, a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus is present.  \nThe rest of the brain and skull are normal."
