  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATION: Cystoscopy and removal of foreign objects from the urethra. BRACHYTHERAPY: Iodine 125. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg IV preoperatively. Total seeds were 59. Activity of 0.439, 30 seeds in the periphery with 10 needles and total of 8 seeds at the anterior of the fold, 4 needles. Please note that the total needles placed on the top were actually 38 seeds and 22 seeds were returned back. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 72-year-old male who presented to us with elevated PSA and prostate biopsy with Gleason 6 cancer on the right apex. Options such as watchful waiting, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, and external beam radiation were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, dysuria, burning pain, hematuria, future procedures, and failure of the procedure were all discussed. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient wanted to wait until he came back from his summer vacations, so a one dose of Zoladex was given. Prostate size measured about 15 g in the OR and about 22 g about two months ago. Consent was obtained. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient had a Foley catheter placed sterilely. The scrotum was taped up using Ioban. Transrectal ultrasound was done. The prostate was measured 15 g. Multiple images were taken. A volume study was done. This was given to the physicist, Dr. X was present who is radiation oncologist who helped with implanting of the seeds. Total of 38 seeds were placed in the patient with 10 peripheral needles and then 4 internal needles. Total of 30 seeds were placed in the periphery and total of 8 seeds were placed in the inside. They were done directly under transrectal ultrasound vision. The seeds were placed directly under ultrasound guidance. There was a nice distribution of the seeds. A couple of more seeds were placed on the right side due to the location of the prostate cancer. Subsequently at the end of the procedure, fluoroscopy was done. Couple of images were obtained. Cystoscopy was done at the end of the procedure where a seed was visualized right in the urethra, which was grasped and pulled out using grasper, which was difficult to get the seed off of the spacers, which was actually pulled out. There were no further seeds visualized in the bladder. The bladder appeared normal. At the end of the procedure, a Foley catheter was kept in place of 18 French and the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition.",

We discussed several treatment options: watchful waiting, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, and external beam radiation. We explained the risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, heart attack, blood clots, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urethral narrowing, painful urination, blood in the urine, future procedures, and the chance that the treatment might not work. He understood all the risks and benefits and chose to proceed. He wanted to wait until after his summer vacation, so we gave him one dose of Zoladex. The prostate weighed about 15 g during surgery, compared with about 22 g two months earlier. Consent was obtained.  \n\nDETAILS OF THE OPERATION:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia. He was positioned on his back with legs raised (dorsal lithotomy). A sterile Foley catheter was inserted. The scrotum was taped with Ioban. A transrectal ultrasound was performed to measure the prostate (15 g) and to guide the seed placement.  \n\nDr. X, a radiation oncologist, helped place the seeds. Under ultrasound guidance, 38 seeds were inserted: 30 in the outer part of the prostate and 8 inside. Additional seeds were added on the right side because of the cancer location. Fluoroscopy images were taken at the end.  \n\nA cystoscopy was performed at the end of the procedure. A seed was seen in the urethra; it was grasped and removed with a grasper. The seed was difficult to detach from the spacers but was successfully removed. No other seeds were found in the bladder, which looked normal. An 18‑French Foley catheter was left in place. The patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition."
