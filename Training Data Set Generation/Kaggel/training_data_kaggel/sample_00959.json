Recurrent herniated nucleus pulposus at L4-L5 bilaterally. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Recurrent spinal stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1. 2. Spondylolisthesis, which is unstable at L4-L5. 3. Recurrent herniated nucleus pulposus at L4-L5 bilaterally. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Microscopic-assisted revision of bilateral decompressive lumbar laminectomies and foraminotomies at the levels of L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1. 2. Posterior spinal fusion at the level of L4-L5 and L5-S1 utilizing local bone graft, allograft and segmental instrumentation. 3. Posterior lumbar interbody arthrodesis utilizing cage instrumentation at L4-L5 with local bone graft and allograft. All procedures were performed under SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitoring. ANESTHESIA: General via endotracheal tube. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 1000 cc. CELL SAVER RETURNED: Approximately 550 cc. SPECIMENS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAIN: 8-inch Hemovac. SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 59-year-old male who had severe disabling low back pain. He had previous lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5. He was noted to have an isthmic spondylolisthesis. Previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable. He is suffering from neurogenic claudication. He was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment. He has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to OR #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia. He was subsequently placed prone on the Jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded. His lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of L3 to S1. This was in the midline. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply. Electrocautery provided hemostasis. Electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia. The lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline. Subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of L3-S1. Once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a Kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of L3-L4. Once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed. With palpation of the spinous processes, the L4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable. These were readily mobile with digital palpation. A rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1. This bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting. The rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of L3 to superior half of S1. Once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of L4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained. Additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1. The microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization. There was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure. Once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the L4 and L5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at L4-L5. Once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility. The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. Working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at L4-l5. This was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis. These were placed in the pedicles of L4 and L5 under direct intensification. The position of the screws were visualized, both AP and lateral images. They were deemed satisfactory. Once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across L4-L5. This allowed for additional decompression of the L5 and L4 nerve roots. Once this was completed, the L5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed. Utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the L4-L5 interval. This was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space. This was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature. Once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained. Once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of L4 and L5 bilaterally. Once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried. A 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and Allograft. There were impacted at the interspace of L4-L5 under direct image intensification. Once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried. The provisional screws and plates were removed. This allowed for additional compression along L4-L5 with the cage instrumentation. Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 bilaterally. This was performed under direct image intensification. The position was verified in both AP and lateral images. Once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an AM2 Midas Rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone. The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried. The morcellized Allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of L4-S1 bilaterally. A 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from L4-S1. Appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws. They were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the L4 vertebra. Once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory. All connections were tightened and retightened in Torque 2 specifications. The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried. The dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension. At the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitors. An 8-inch Hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound. The lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin. The remainder of the Hemovac was assembled. Bulky compression dressing utilizing Adaptic, 4x4, and ABDs was then affixed to the lumbar spine with Microfoam tape. He was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. The patient has recurring narrowing of the spinal canal at the lower back levels L3‑L4, L4‑L5, and L5‑S1.  \n2. He has a slipped vertebra (spondylolisthesis) that is unstable at L4‑L5.  \n3. He also has a recurring herniated disc at L4‑L5 on both sides.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \nThe same three conditions were found after surgery.  \n\n**Procedure performed**  \nThe surgeon used a microscope to redo the bone removal that had been done before, widening the spinal canal and the openings for the nerves at L3‑L4, L4‑L5, and L5‑S1.  \nThen the surgeon fused the lower back bones at L4‑L5 and L5‑S1 using the patient’s own bone, donated bone, and metal hardware.  \nFinally, a cage was placed between L4 and L5 with bone grafts to help the bones grow together.  \nThroughout the operation the surgeon monitored the patient’s nerve signals.  \n\n**Anesthesia**  \nThe patient was given general anesthesia and a breathing tube was inserted.  \n\n**Estimated blood loss**  \nAbout 1,000 milliliters of blood was lost.  \n\n**Cell saver returned**  \nAbout 550 milliliters of the patient’s own blood was collected and returned to him.  \n\n**Specimens**  \nNo tissue samples were taken.  \n\n**Complications**  \nNone.  \n\n**Drain**  \nAn 8‑inch Hemovac drain was placed.  \n\n**Surgical indications**  \nThe patient is a 59‑year‑old man who has severe back pain that makes normal movement difficult. He had earlier surgery at L4‑L5 that removed part of the bone. He also has a slipped vertebra that became more unstable after that surgery. He experiences pain and numbness when walking (neurogenic claudication). All other non‑surgical treatments did not help. He was fully informed about the risks, benefits, possible complications, and other treatment options, and he gave his consent.  \n\n**Operative technique**  \nThe patient was taken to operating room #5 and given general anesthesia. He was placed face‑down on a special spinal table, and all bony points were padded. The surgeon cleaned and covered the lower back. The previous midline incision was extended from about L3 to the sacrum (S1). The skin and fat were removed sharply, and cautery was used to stop bleeding. The surgeon cut through the fat and split the lumbar fascia in the middle. He then lifted the bone from the suspected levels L3 to S1. The transverse processes were identified, and a cross‑table X‑ray confirmed the space between L3 and L4. A self‑retaining retractor was placed. The surgeon felt that the L4 back bones were loose and unstable. He used a rongeur to remove the spinous processes from the lower half of L3 to the upper half of S1. The bone was chopped into small pieces and set aside for grafting. The rongeur also thinned the laminae from the lower half of L3 to the upper half of S1. The surgeon carefully freed the unstable L4 back bones until a wide opening was achieved. Additional bone removal extended from the lower half of L3 to the upper half of S1. A microscope helped the surgeon see the area. No changes were noted during the decompression or the rest of the surgery. After decompression, the surgeon inspected each nerve root. Because of the unstable slipped vertebra, the L4 and L5 nerve roots were tight at the L4‑L5 disc space. The surgeon made foraminotomies to give the nerves more room. The wound was washed with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. Temporary titanium screws were placed at L4‑L5 to help straighten the slipped vertebra. The screws were positioned under X‑ray guidance and looked good. A temporary plate was attached to the screws and the vertebrae were pulled apart slightly, which also helped decompress the nerves. The L5 nerve root was traced and found to exit the neural foramen normally after more dissection and disc removal. A series of interbody spacers were used: an 8‑mm spacer was placed at L4‑L5, then larger ones up to 13 mm, and finally an 11‑mm spacer that matched the anatomy was chosen. The spacers were placed on the left side and the vertebrae were pulled apart to 11 mm. The surgeon used interbody shavers to clean the bone surfaces on both sides of L4 and L5. The wound was washed again. Carbon‑fiber cages (11 mm high × 9 mm wide × 25 mm long) were packed with the patient’s own bone and donated bone and inserted into the L4‑L5 space under X‑ray. The cages were checked and looked good. The temporary screws and plate were removed, allowing the cages to compress the vertebrae. Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 on both sides under X‑ray. The position was confirmed on both front‑back and side views. The posterolateral gutters were cleaned with a burr until bleeding bone was exposed. The wound was washed again. The chopped bone graft was mixed with the patient’s bone and packed around the transverse processes of L4‑S1 on both sides. A 0.25‑inch titanium rod was bent to fit from L4 to S1. Cross‑connectors were attached and the rod was placed over the screws. The screws were tightened in a sequence that also helped straighten the L4 vertebra. Final X‑ray images were reviewed and looked good. All connections were tightened again to the proper torque. The wound was washed again. The dura (the outer covering of the spinal cord) was checked and was not tight. Throughout the operation, the nerve monitors (SSEP, EMG) showed no changes. An 8‑inch Hemovac drain was placed. The lumbar fascia was stitched with #1 Vicryl in interrupted stitches, the subcutaneous tissue with #2‑0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with stainless‑steel clips. The drain was finished. A bulky compression dressing with Adaptic, 4×4, and ABDs was applied to the spine with Microfoam tape. The patient was turned and taken to the recovery room in good condition. The expected surgical outcome is guarded."
