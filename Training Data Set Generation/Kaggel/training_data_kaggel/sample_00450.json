  "medical": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left hip pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 32-year-old male seen by Dr. ABC several weeks ago for persistent left hip pain. He has a long eight to ten year history of pain into the left hip. He has been worked up by several specialists and evaluated. He was thought initially to have low back pain with radiculopathy. He does have a history of antibiotic steroid use as well as heavy drinking. He reports his symptoms started approximately eight years ago when he was doing some construction at which time he began to have left hip pain. He has had difficulties on and off ever since then. On the last visit, radiographs revealed severe degenerative changes of the left hip joint with apparent AVN of the left femoral head. He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement. He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further. He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities. He has used a cane in the past for a short period and he continues to have difficulty with the left hip. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes and high blood pressure. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He had a history of surgery for an undescended testicle. MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Prozac, lisinopril, Norco, and glimepiride. ALLERGIES: No know drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient current smokes. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals significant limited internal rotation of the left hip. He essentially has 0 degrees of internal rotation compared to the contralateral hip, which has approximately 30 degrees. He has significant pain with hip range of motion. There is no significant leg length discrepancy. He has no numbness or tingling distal and 2+ pulses. X-RAYS: Review of films taken previously reveals severe degenerative changes consistent with AVN. ASSESSMENT: Left hip avascular necrosis. PLAN: I had a long discussion with the patient regarding his problem and he voiced understanding. We discussed the possibility of hip arthrodesis versus hip replacement versus hip resurfacing and the high likelihood that any one of these procedures may require further operations throughout his life secondary to his young age and high activity level. We discussed a referral to a hip specialist, who performs resurfacing procedures specifically Dr. XYZ in Houston. Referral will be arranged for him. All questions were answered to his satisfaction. He was also given a prescription of Norco 10/325, #60 and Flexeril until he is able to arrange an appointment with a hip specialist.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Pain in the left hip.\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nA 32‑year‑old man has had left hip pain for about 8–10 years. He first saw Dr. ABC a few weeks ago because the pain had not gone away. He has been examined by several specialists. Initially, doctors thought he had back pain that was radiating down his leg. He has used antibiotics, steroids, and drinks heavily. The pain started when he was doing construction work eight years ago. Since then, it has come and gone. In his last visit, X‑rays showed severe wear and tear in the left hip joint and signs that the bone in the top of the thigh bone (femoral head) may be dying (avascular necrosis, or AVN). He was given pain medicine and the doctors talked about sending him to a specialist to consider hip resurfacing or a full hip replacement. He came for a second opinion, and we talked more about his problems. He mainly has groin pain that limits his everyday activities. He has used a cane for a short time and still has trouble moving his left hip.\n\n**Past Medical History:** Diabetes and high blood pressure.  \n**Past Surgical History:** Surgery for an undescended testicle.  \n**Medications:** Metformin, Prozac, lisinopril, Norco, and glimepiride.  \n**Allergies:** No known drug allergies.  \n**Social History:** He currently smokes.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- The left hip can’t rotate inward at all (0°), while the right hip can rotate about 30°.  \n- He feels a lot of pain when moving the hip.  \n- The legs are the same length.  \n- No numbness or tingling in the legs.  \n- Pulse in the legs is normal (2+).\n\n**X‑Rays:** Show severe joint wear and signs of AVN.\n\n**Assessment:** Avascular necrosis of the left hip.\n\n**Plan:**  \nI talked with him at length about his condition. He understood the situation. We discussed options: hip fusion, hip replacement, or hip resurfacing. Because he is young and active, any of these surgeries may need more operations later in life. We decided to refer him to a hip specialist who does resurfacing, Dr. XYZ in Houston. The referral will be arranged. All his questions were answered. He was given a prescription for Norco 10/325 (60 tablets) and Flexeril until he can see the hip specialist."
