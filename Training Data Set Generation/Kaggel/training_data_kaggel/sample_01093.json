  "medical": "DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: This tracing was obtained utilizing 27 paste-on gold-plated surface disc electrodes placed according to the International 10-20 system. Electrode impedances were measured and reported at less than 5 kilo-ohms each. FINDINGS: In general, the background rhythms are bilaterally symmetrical. During the resting awake state they are composed of moderate amounts of low amplitude fast activity intermixed with moderate amounts of well-modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity best seen posteriorly. The alpha activity attenuates with eye opening. During some portions of the tracing the patient enters a drowsy state in which the background rhythms are composed predominantly of moderate amounts of low amplitude fast activity intermixed with moderate amounts of low to medium amplitude polymorphic theta activity. There is no evidence of focal slowing or paroxysmal activity. IMPRESSION: Normal awake and drowsy (stage I sleep) EEG for patient's age.",
  "layman": "We recorded the brain activity using 27 gold‑plated electrodes placed on the scalp according to the standard 10‑20 layout. Each electrode had a low impedance of less than 5 kΩ.\n\n**Findings**  \nOverall, the brain waves were symmetrical on both sides. While the patient was awake and resting, the waves consisted of moderate low‑amplitude fast activity mixed with moderate 9‑10 Hz alpha waves, especially at the back of the head. The alpha waves decreased when the eyes were opened. In some parts of the recording the patient became drowsy; the waves then mainly showed moderate low‑amplitude fast activity combined with moderate low‑to‑medium amplitude theta waves of various shapes. No abnormal slowing or sudden spikes were seen.\n\n**Impression**  \nThe EEG shows normal brain activity for an awake person and for a lightly drowsy state (stage I sleep) for someone of this age."
