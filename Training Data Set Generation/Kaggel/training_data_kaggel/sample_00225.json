  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:This is a 53-year-old female with left knee pain being evaluated for ACL tear. FINDINGS: This examination was performed on 10-14-05. Normal medial meniscus without intrasubstance degeneration, surface fraying or discrete meniscal tear. There is a discoid lateral meniscus and although there may be minimal superficial fraying along the inner edge of the body, there is no discrete tear (series #6 images #7-12). There is a near-complete or complete tear of the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament. The ligament has a balled-up appearance consistent with at least partial retraction of most of the fibers of the ligament. There may be a few fibers still intact (series #4 images #12-14; series #5 images #12-14). The tibial fibers are normal. Normal posterior cruciate ligament. There is a sprain of the medial collateral ligament, with mild separation of the deep and superficial fibers at the femoral attachment (series #7 images #6-12). There is no complete tear or discontinuity and there is no meniscocapsular separation. There is a sprain of the lateral ligament complex without focal tear or discontinuity of any of the intraarticular components. Normal iliotibial band. Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons. There is contusion within the posterolateral corner of the tibia. There is also contusion within the patella at the midline patellar ridge where there is an area of focal chondral flattening (series #8 images #10-13). The medial and lateral patellar facets are otherwise normal as is the femoral trochlea in the there is no patellar subluxation. There is a mild strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle extending into the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum but there is no complete tear or discontinuity. Normal lateral patellar retinaculum. There is a joint effusion and plica. IMPRESSION: Discoid lateral meniscus without a tear although there may be minimal superficial fraying along the inner edge of the body. Near-complete if not complete tear of the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament. Medial capsule sprain with associated strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle. There is focal contusion within the patella at the midline patella ridge. Joint effusion and plica.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** MRI of the left knee (no contrast)  \n**Clinical:** 53‑year‑old woman with left knee pain, being checked for an ACL tear.  \n\n**Findings:**  \nThe scan was done on 10‑14‑05.  \n- The medial meniscus looks normal – no wear, fraying, or tear.  \n- The lateral meniscus is “discoid” (a bit thicker than usual). It may have a little surface fraying near its inner edge, but there is no clear tear.  \n- The ACL’s attachment to the femur (thigh bone) is almost or completely torn. The ligament looks swollen and some fibers may still be attached, but most have pulled back. The tibial side of the ACL is normal.  \n- The posterior cruciate ligament is normal.  \n- The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is sprained; the deep and superficial parts at its femur attachment are slightly separated. There is no full tear or separation from the meniscus.  \n- The lateral ligament complex is sprained but has no tear.  \n- The iliotibial band, quadriceps tendon, and patellar tendon are normal.  \n- There is bruising (contusion) in the back‑outer corner of the tibia.  \n- There is bruising in the middle of the patella (kneecap) where a small area of cartilage is flattened. The sides of the patella and the femoral groove are normal, and the patella is not displaced.  \n- The vastus medialis oblique muscle (part of the quadriceps) has a mild strain that extends into the medial patellar ligament and retinaculum, but there is no full tear.  \n- The lateral patellar retinaculum is normal.  \n- There is fluid in the joint (effusion) and a plica (fold of tissue).  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- Discoid lateral meniscus with no tear, only slight surface fraying.  \n- Near‑complete or complete tear of the ACL’s femoral attachment.  \n- Sprain of the medial capsule with a mild strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle.  \n- Bruising in the middle of the patella.  \n- Joint fluid and a plica."
