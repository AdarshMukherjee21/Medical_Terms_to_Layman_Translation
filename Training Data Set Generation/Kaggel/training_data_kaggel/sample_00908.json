  "medical": "CC: Headache. HX: This 37y/o LHM was seen one month prior to this presentation for HA, nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal evaluation at that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home. These symptoms had been recurrent since onset. At presentation he complained of mild blurred vision (OU), difficulty concentrating and HA which worsened upon sitting up. The headaches were especially noticeable in the early morning. He described them as non-throbbing headaches. They begin in the bifrontal region and radiate posteriorly. They occurred up to 6 times/day. The HA improved with lying down or dropping the head down between the knees towards the floor. The headaches were associated with blurred vision, nausea,vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. He denied any scotomata or positive visual phenomena. He denies any weakness, numbness, tingling, dysarthria or diplopia. His weight has fluctuated from 163# to 148# over the past 3 months and at present he weighs 154#. His appetite has been especially poor in the past month. MEDS:Sulfasalazine qid. Tylenol 650mg q4hours. PMH: 1)Ulcerative Colitis dx 1989. 2)HTN 3) occasional HAs since the early 1980s which are different in character and much less severe than his current HAs. They were not associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia or difficulty thinking. FHX: MGF with h/o stroke. Mother and Father were healthy. No h/o of migraine in family. SHX: Single. Works as a newpaper printing press worker. Denies tobacco, ETOH or illicit drug use, but admits he was a heavy drinker until the last 1970s when he quit. EXAM: BP159/92 HR 48 (sitting): BP126/70 HR48 (supine). RR14 36.2C MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech clear. Appears uncomfortable but acts appropriately and cooperatively. No difficulty with short and long term memory. CN: Grad 2-3 papilledema OS; Grade 1 papilledema (@2 o'clock) OD. Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Bilateral horizontal sustained nystagmus on right and leftward gaze. Bilateral vertical sustained nystagmus on up and downward gaze. Face symmetric with full movement and PP sensation. Tongue midline with full ROM. Gag and SCM were intact bilaterally. Motor: Full strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: Unremarkable. Coord: Mild dysynergia on FNF movements in BUE. HNS and RAM were unremarkable. Station: Unsteady with and without eyes open on Romberg test. No drift in any particular direction. Gait: Wide based, ataxic and to some degree magnetic and apraxic. Gen Exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: Urinalysis revealed 1-2RBC, 2-3WBC and bacteria were noted. Repeat Urinalysis was negative the next day. PT, PTT, CXR and GS were normal. CBC revealed 10.4WBC with 7.1Granulocytes. HCT, 10/18/95, revealed hydrocephalus. MRI, 10/18/95, revealed ventriculomegaly of the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles. There was enhancement of the meninges about the prepontine cisterna and internal auditory canals, and enhancement of a scar or inflammed lining of the foramen of Magendie. These changes were felt suggestive of bacterial or granulomatous meningitis. The patient underwent ventriculostomy on 10/19/94. CSF taken on 10/19/94 via V-P shunt insertion revealed: 22 WBC (21 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte), 380 RBC, Glucose 58, Protein 29, GS negative, Cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB) negative, Cryptococcal Antigen and India Ink were negative. Numerous CSF samples were taken from the lumbar region and shunt reservoir and these were consistantly unremarkable except for an occasional CSF protein of up to 99mg/dl. Serum and CSF toxoplasma titers and ACE levels were negative on multiple occasions. VDRL and HIV testing was unremarkable. 10/27/94 and 10/31/94 CSF cultures taken from the cervical region eventually grew non-encapsulated crytococcus neoformans. The patient was treated with amphotericin and showed some improvement. However, scarring had probably occurred by then and the V-P shunt was left in place.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Headache.  \n\n**History of present illness:**  \nA 37‑year‑old man with ulcerative colitis and high blood pressure came in with a headache, nausea, and vomiting. A month ago he was seen for the same symptoms; a GI exam found no bowel blockage and he was sent home. The headache and nausea have come and gone since they started.  \n\nNow he reports mild blurred vision in both eyes, trouble concentrating, and headaches that get worse when he sits up. The headaches are worse in the early morning. He says they are not throbbing. They start in the forehead and spread to the back of the head. He can get them up to six times a day. Lying down or bending his head toward his knees helps. The headaches are accompanied by blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound. He has no visual spots or flashes, no weakness, numbness, tingling, slurred speech, or double vision.  \n\nHis weight has dropped from 163 lb to 148 lb over the past three months; he now weighs 154 lb. His appetite has been very poor for the last month.  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Sulfasalazine, four times a day  \n- Tylenol 650 mg every 4 hours  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n- Ulcerative colitis (diagnosed 1989)  \n- Hypertension  \n- Occasional headaches since the early 1980s that were different and less severe, not linked to nausea, vomiting, light or sound sensitivity, or thinking problems.  \n\n**Family history:**  \n- Mother and father healthy; no family history of migraines.  \n\n**Social history:**  \n- Single, works at a newspaper printing press.  \n- Does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.  \n- Was a heavy drinker until the late 1970s, when he quit.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 159/92 sitting, 126/70 lying down; heart rate 48; breathing 14/min; temperature 36.2 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Speech clear. Looks uncomfortable but is cooperative. No memory problems.  \n\n**Cranial nerves:**  \n- Mild swelling of the optic discs (papilledema) in both eyes, more pronounced in the left eye.  \n- Pupils equal, 4 mm, constrict to 2 mm with light.  \n- Horizontal eye jerks when looking left or right; vertical jerks when looking up or down.  \n- Face symmetrical, full movement, normal sensation.  \n- Tongue midline, full range of motion.  \n- Gag reflex and sternocleidomastoid muscle normal on both sides.  \n\n**Motor:** Full strength, normal muscle bulk and tone.  \n**Sensory:** Normal.  \n**Coordination:** Slight difficulty with finger‑to‑nose movements in both arms.  \n**Hearing and balance:** Normal.  \n**Balance test (Romberg):** Unsteady with or without eyes closed, no drift.  \n**Gait:** Wide base, unsteady, some magnetic and awkward steps.  \n\n**General exam:** Normal.  \n\n**Course and investigations:**  \n- Urine test: 1–2 red cells, 2–3 white cells, bacteria. Next day urine normal.  \n- PT, PTT, chest X‑ray, and glucose normal.  \n- CBC: 10.4 k white cells, 7.1 k granulocytes.  \n- Imaging on 10/18/95: enlarged brain ventricles (hydrocephalus). MRI same day showed enlarged lateral, third, and fourth ventricles, thickening of the meninges near the base of the brain and inner ear canals, and thickening at the foramen of Magendie—suggestive of bacterial or granulomatous meningitis.  \n- Ventriculostomy performed on 10/19/94. CSF taken during shunt placement: 22 white cells (21 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte), 380 red cells, glucose 58, protein 29; cultures negative for bacteria, fungus, TB; cryptococcal antigen and India ink negative.  \n- Multiple CSF samples from lumbar puncture and shunt reservoir were normal except occasional protein up to 99 mg/dl.  \n- Blood and CSF tests for toxoplasma and ACE negative. VDRL and HIV tests normal.  \n- CSF cultures from cervical region on 10/27 and 10/31 grew non‑encapsulated *Cryptococcus neoformans*.  \n- Treated with amphotericin; some improvement noted, but scarring likely had already occurred, so the shunt was left in place."
