PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was given intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis and thigh-high TED hoses were placed on the lower extremities while in the preanesthesia holding area. The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The head was placed on a well-padded head holder. The eyes and face were protected from pressure. A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis. The arms were tucked and draped to the sides. All bony prominences were well padded. An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision. The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery. The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided. The midline structures were reflected to the right side. Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected. The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally. An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7. The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection. Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery. The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally. At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely. Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space. All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6. The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints. The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur. Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs. The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies. Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete. A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression. Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment. The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings. The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment. In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling. The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter. Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone. The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space. The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis. The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces. There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7. A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position. Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling. An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis. The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6. Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures. The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws. An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts. Blood loss was minimal. The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics. The wound was inspected and judged to be dry. The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips. The sponge and needle count were correct. A sterile dressing was applied to the wound. The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis. The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. Nerve pain in the neck at levels C5‑C6 and C6‑C7.  \n2. Neck bone wear (spondylosis) that is causing symptoms at C5‑C6 and C6‑C7.  \n3. Narrowing of the spinal canal (stenosis) at C5‑C6 and C6‑C7 that is symptomatic.  \n4. Herniated discs at C5‑C6 and C6‑C7 that are causing symptoms.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses** – the same four conditions listed above.  \n\n**Operative procedure**  \n1. Code 63075 – removal of disc and bone spurs at C5‑C6 from the front of the neck.  \n2. Code 63076 – removal of disc and bone spurs at C6‑7 from the front of the neck.  \n3. Code 22851 – placement of a bone‑like spacer at C5‑C6.  \n4. Code 22851‑59 – placement of a spacer at C6‑7.  \n5. Code 22554‑51 – fusion of the front of the spine at C5‑C6.  \n6. Code 22585 – fusion of the front of the spine at C6‑7.  \n7. Code 22845 – placement of metal rods and screws from C5 to C7.  \n\n**Anesthesia** – general anesthesia with a breathing tube.  \n**Estimated blood loss** – negligible.  \n**Drains** – a small suction drain in the neck wound.  \n**Complications** – none.  \n\n**Procedure in detail**  \nThe patient received an IV antibiotic before surgery and had compression stockings on the legs. She was taken to the operating room and laid flat on the table. General anesthesia was started. Her head was placed on a padded holder, and her eyes and face were protected. A padded roll was put under her neck and shoulders to keep the natural curve of the neck. Her arms were tucked and covered. All bony points were padded.  \n\nAn X‑ray confirmed the correct spot for the skin cut. The front of the neck was cleaned and covered with sterile cloth. A straight horizontal cut was made on the left side of the neck, cutting through skin and fat to the platysma muscle, which was cut across with a cautery device. The layers of deep neck tissue were split. The middle structures were moved to the right side. Care was taken to avoid the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the usual spot of that nerve was protected. The carotid sheath was felt and kept safe on the side. Another X‑ray confirmed the levels C5‑C6 and C6‑C7.  \n\nThe longus colli muscle was freed on both sides from C5 to C7 with blunt tools. Bleeding was stopped with cautery. Retractors were placed behind the longus colli muscles on both sides. At C5‑C6, the front ligament of the spine was cut across. Tools were used to remove the disc material. Cartilage was scraped off the lower part of C5 and the upper part of C6. The disc removal went back to the back ligament and out to the side joints. The back ligament was cut with a small rongeur. Bone spurs were removed from the middle and the nerve openings with small rongeurs. The surgeon noted heavy bone wear that was narrowing the canal and nerve openings, and a disc that was bulging, matching the pre‑op imaging.  \n\nAfter the disc and bone removal, a blunt hook was passed into the canal above and below, and into both nerve openings to check for any leftover disc fragments and to confirm the bone removal was complete. A part of the side joint was removed on both sides for extra nerve relief. Both nerve roots were seen and were free. The same steps were repeated at C6‑C7. The only difference was that at C6‑C7 on the left side, a disc fragment had pushed into the canal and the left nerve opening, causing significant pressure on the spinal cord and nerve root.  \n\nFor the fusion, the bone surfaces of C5, C6, and C7 were ground down to bleeding bone with a high‑speed drill and cooling fluid. The disc spaces were measured. Two pieces of prepared bone graft (corticocancellous) were shaped to fit each disc space exactly, with about 1.5 mm of space at each level. The grafts were slightly curved to keep the neck’s natural curve. The grafts were pressed into the disc spaces. A blunt hook was passed behind each graft to confirm proper placement. Remaining bone spurs were removed with a high‑speed drill and cooling fluid.  \n\nA cervical plate of the right length was chosen and bent slightly to match the patient’s neck curve. The plate was held in the middle with the supplied tools, and a temporary screw was placed at C6. Drill holes were made with a guide, taking care not to damage nerves or blood vessels. The plate was fixed firmly to the front of the spine with 14‑mm screws, and locking screws were added to lock the screws in place and prevent loosening. An X‑ray confirmed the plate, screws, and grafts were in good position.  \n\nBlood loss was minimal. The wound was washed with antibiotic solution. The wound was checked and found to be dry. The wound was closed over the suction drain placed deep in the wound. The platysma muscle was stitched with #4‑0 Vicryl in a running stitch, the deeper layers with #4‑0 Monocryl interrupted stitches, and the skin with Steri‑Strips. The sponge and needle counts were correct. A sterile dressing was applied. A neck brace was put on. The patient tolerated the surgery and was moved to recovery in stable condition."
