  "medical": "MEDICATIONS: 1. Versed intravenously. 2. Demerol intravenously. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and sedated with the above medications. The Olympus video colonoscope was inserted through the anus and was advanced in retrograde fashion through the sigmoid colon, descending colon, around the splenic flexure, into the transverse colon, around the hepatic flexure, down the ascending colon, into the cecum. The cecum was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve. The colonoscope was then advanced through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum, which was normal on examination. The scope was then pulled back into the cecum and then slowly withdrawn. The mucosa was examined in detail. The mucosa was entirely normal. Upon reaching the rectum, retroflex examination of the rectum was normal. The scope was then straightened out, the air removed and the scope withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no apparent complications.",

Demerol given through a vein.\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:**  \nAfter the patient gave permission, they were put on their left side and given the medications above to help them relax. A video colonoscope from Olympus was inserted through the anus and moved backward through the sigmoid colon, descending colon, around the splenic bend, into the transverse colon, around the hepatic bend, down the ascending colon, and into the cecum. The cecum was found by spotting the opening of the appendix and the ileocecal valve. The scope was then passed through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum, which looked normal. The scope was pulled back into the cecum and then slowly pulled out. The lining of the colon was examined closely and was completely normal. When the scope reached the rectum, a backward look at the rectum was normal. The scope was straightened, the air was released, and the scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications."
