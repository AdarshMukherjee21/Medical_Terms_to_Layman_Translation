  "medical": "CC: Progressive unsteadiness following head trauma. HX: A7 7 y/o male fell, as he was getting out of bed, and struck his head, 4 weeks prior to admission. He then began to experience progressive unsteadiness and gait instability for several days after the fall. He was then evaluated at a local ER and prescribed meclizine. This did not improve his symptoms, and over the past one week prior to admission began to develop left facial/LUE/LLE weakness. He was seen by a local MD on the 12/8/92 and underwent and MRI Brain scan. This showed a right subdural mass. He was then transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. PMH: 1)cardiac arrhythmia. 2)HTN. 3) excision of lip lesion 1 yr ago. SHX/FHX: Unremarkable. No h/o ETOH abuse. MEDS: Meclizine, Procardia XL. EXAM: Afebrile, BP132/74 HR72 RR16 MS: A & O x 3. Speech fluent. Comprehension, naming, repetition were intact. CN: Left lower facial weakness only. MOTOR: Left hemiparesis, 4+/5 throughout. Sensory: intact PP/TEMP/LT/PROP/VIB Coordination: ND Station: left pronator drift. Gait: left hemiparesis evident by decreased LUE swing and LLE drag. Reflexes: 2/3 in UE; 2/2 LE; Right plantar downgoing; Left plantar equivocal. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: Outside MRI revealed a loculated subdural hematoma extending throughout the frontotemporoparieto-occipital regions on the right. There was effacement of the right lateral ventricle. and a 0.5 cm leftward midline shift. He underwent a HCT on admission, 12/8/92, which showed a right subdural hematoma. He then underwent emergent evacuation of this hematoma. He was discharged home 6 days after surgery.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:**  \nThe boy has been getting more and more unsteady after hitting his head.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nA 7‑year‑old boy fell from his bed about a month ago and hit his head. After the fall he started feeling increasingly unsteady and had trouble walking. He went to a local emergency room and was given meclizine, but it didn’t help. In the week before he was admitted he also developed weakness on the left side of his face, left arm, and left leg. On December 8, 1992 a local doctor did an MRI of his brain, which showed a right‑side subdural mass. He was then sent to UIHC for further care.\n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Heart rhythm problem  \n2. High blood pressure  \n3. Had a lip lesion removed a year ago  \n\n**Social/Family history:**  \nNo significant issues. No alcohol abuse.\n\n**Medications:**  \nMeclizine, Procardia XL\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Temperature normal, blood pressure 132/74, heart rate 72, breathing 16, alert and oriented.  \n- Speech clear; understanding, naming, and repeating words are fine.  \n- Facial weakness only on the lower left side.  \n- Muscle strength: left side of body 4+/5 (slightly weak).  \n- Sensation normal.  \n- Coordination normal.  \n- Left arm drifts down when standing.  \n- Walking shows left arm swinging less and left leg dragging.  \n- Reflexes: 2/3 in arms, 2/2 in legs. Plantar reflexes normal on right, unclear on left.  \n- General exam normal.\n\n**Course:**  \nThe MRI showed a loculated subdural hematoma on the right side, affecting the front, temporal, parietal, and occipital areas. It pushed the right lateral ventricle and caused a 0.5 cm shift of the brain’s midline to the left. A head CT on admission confirmed the right subdural hematoma. He had emergency surgery to remove the clot. He was discharged home six days after the operation."
