  "medical": "This is a 63-year-old female complaining of neck pain. Patient is status post MVA (rear-ended) on 02/10/2006. FINDINGS:Normal foramen magnum. Normal brainstem-cervical cord junction. There is no tonsillar ectopia. Normal clivus and craniovertebral junction. Normal anterior atlantoaxial articulation. C2-3: There is disc desiccation but no loss of disc space height, disc displacement, endplate spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina. C3-4: There is disc desiccation with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type. The small posterior central disc protrusion measures 3 x 6mm (AP x transverse) in size and is producing ventral thecal sac flattening. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 9mm. There is minimal right-sided uncovertebral joint arthrosis but no substantial foraminal compromise. C4-5: There is disc desiccation, slight loss of disc space height with a right posterior lateral pre-foraminal disc osteophyte complex with right-sided uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis. The disc osteophyte complex measures approximately 5mm in its AP dimension. There is minimal posterior annular bulging measuring approximately 2mm. The AP diameter of the central canal has been narrowed to 9mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. There is probable radicular impingement upon the exiting right C5 nerve root. C5-6: There is disc desiccation, moderate loss of disc space height with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type. The disc protrusion measures approximately 3 x 8mm (AP x transverse) in size. There is ventral thecal sac flattening with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. The residual AP diameter of the central canal has been narrowed to 7mm. Findings indicate a loss of the functional reserve of the central canal but there is no cord edema. There is bilateral uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis with moderate foraminal compromise. C6-7: There is disc desiccation, mild loss of disc space height with 2mm of posterior annular bulging. There is bilateral uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis (left greater than right) with probable radicular impingement upon the bilateral exiting C7 nerve roots. C7-T1, T1-2: There is disc desiccation with no disc displacement. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina. T3-4: There is disc desiccation with minimal 2mm posterior annular bulging but normal central canal and CSF surrounding the cord. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc disease with uncovertebral joint arthrosis with foraminal compromise as described above. C3-4 posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type but no cord impingement. C4-5 right posterior lateral disc osteophyte complex with right-sided uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis with probable radicular impingement upon the right C5 nerve root. C5-6 degenerative disc disease with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type producing borderline central canal stenosis with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft indicating a limited functional reserve of the central canal. C6-7 degenerative disc disease with annular bulging and osseous foraminal compromise with probable impingement upon the bilateral exiting C7 nerve roots. T3-4 degenerative disc disease with posterior annular bulging.",
  "layman": "This 63‑year‑old woman has neck pain. She was in a rear‑end car accident on 02/10/2006.  \n\n**Findings**\n\n- The opening at the base of the skull (foramen magnum) and the junction of the brainstem and spinal cord are normal.  \n- The tonsils are in the right place.  \n- The skull base and the junction where the skull meets the first cervical vertebra (C1) are normal.  \n- The joint between C1 and C2 is normal.  \n\n**C2‑C3**  \n- The disc is dry (desiccated) but its height is fine.  \n- No disc has moved, no bone changes on the ends of the vertebrae, and the joint between the vertebrae is normal.  \n- The spinal canal and the openings for nerves are normal.  \n\n**C3‑C4**  \n- The disc is dry and has a small central bulge (posterior central disc herniation).  \n- The bulge is 3 mm front‑to‑back and 6 mm wide.  \n- It presses slightly on the front of the spinal cord, but fluid (CSF) still surrounds the cord.  \n- The spinal canal is 9 mm wide.  \n- There is a tiny joint change on the right side, but it does not block the nerve openings.  \n\n**C4‑C5**  \n- The disc is dry and a little lower than normal.  \n- A small bony‑disc growth (osteophyte) on the right side presses on the right C5 nerve root.  \n- The growth is about 5 mm front‑to‑back.  \n- There is a small bulge of the disc (2 mm).  \n- The spinal canal is 9 mm wide and still has CSF.  \n\n**C5‑C6**  \n- The disc is dry and has lost some height.  \n- A moderate central bulge (posterior central disc herniation) measures about 3 mm front‑to‑back and 8 mm wide.  \n- It presses on the front of the spinal cord, reducing the space around the cord to 7 mm.  \n- The spinal canal’s functional space is reduced, but the cord is not swollen.  \n- Both sides have joint changes that narrow the nerve openings.  \n\n**C6‑C7**  \n- The disc is dry with a mild loss of height.  \n- There is a 2 mm bulge of the disc.  \n- Both sides have joint changes, especially on the left, that likely press on the C7 nerve roots.  \n\n**C7‑T1, T1‑T2**  \n- The discs are dry but normal in position.  \n- The spinal canal and nerve openings are normal.  \n\n**T3‑T4**  \n- The disc is dry with a small 2 mm bulge.  \n- The spinal canal and CSF are normal.  \n\n**Impression**\n\n- Multiple levels of age‑related disc wear and joint changes, some narrowing the nerve openings.  \n- C3‑C4 has a small disc bulge that does not press on the cord.  \n- C4‑C5 has a bony‑disc growth that probably presses on the right C5 nerve root.  \n- C5‑C6 has a disc bulge that narrows the spinal canal and limits its space.  \n- C6‑C7 has disc bulging and bone changes that likely press on both C7 nerve roots.  \n- T3‑T4 has a small disc bulge."
