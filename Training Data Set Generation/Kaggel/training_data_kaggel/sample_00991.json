  "medical": "CC: Headache and diplopia. HX: This 39 y/o African American female began experiencing severe constant pressure pain type headaches beginning the last week of 8/95. The pain localized to bifronto-temporal regions of the head and did not radiate. There was no associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia or phonophobia. The HA's occurred daily; and throughout daylight hours. They diminished at bedtime, but occasionally awakened her in the morning. Several days following the onset of her HA's, she began experiencing numbness and tingling about the right side of her face. These symptoms improved, but did not completely resolved. Several days after the onset of facial paresthesias, she began to experience binocular horizontal diplopia. The diplopia resolved when covering either eye, and worsened upon looking toward the right. Coincidentally, she began veering toward the right when walking. She denied any weakness. She had had chronic unsteadiness for many years since developing juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She was unsure whether her unsteadiness was due to poor depth perception in light of her diplopia. The patient was admitted locally 9/2/95. HCT, 9/2/95 and Brain MRI with gadolinium, 9/3/95, were &quot;unremarkable.&quot; Lumbar puncture (done locally),9/3/95: Opening pressure 27cm H20, CSF analysis ( protein 14.0, glucose 66, O WBC, 3 RBC, VDRL non-reactive, Lyme titer unremarkable, Myelin basic protein 1.0 (normal &lt;4.0), and there was no evidence of oligoclonal bands. ESR=76. On 9/11/95 ESR=110. Acetylcholine receptor binding and blocking antibodies were negative. 9/4/95, ANA and RF were negative. 7/94, ANA and RF were negative, and ESR=60. MEDS: Tylenol 500mg q5-6hrs. No known Allergies. PMH: 1)Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis diagnosed at age 10 years; now in remission. 2)Right #5 finger reattachment as child due to traumatic amputation. FHX: Mother died age 42 of unknown type cancer. Father died age 62 of unknown type cancer. 4 sisters, one brother and 2 half-brothers. One of the half-brothers has asthma. SHX: Single, lives with sister, and denies Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP141/84, HR99, RR14, 36.8C, Wt. 82kg Ht. 152. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent; without dysarthria. Mood euthymic with appropriate affect. CN: Decreased abduction, OD. In neutral gaze, the right eye deviated slightly lateral of midline. In addition, she had mild proptosis, OD. The right eye was nontender to palpation during extraocular movement. Visual fields were full to confrontation. Optic disks appeared flat. Face was symmetric with full movement and sensation. Gag, shoulder shrug and corneal responses were intact, bilaterally. Tongue was midline with full ROM. MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. SENSORY: Unremarkable. COORD: Unremarkable FNF/HKS/RAM. STATION: Unremarkable. NO Romberg's sign or drift. GAIT: Narrow based gait. Able to TT and HW without difficulty. Mild difficulty with TW. REFLEXES: 2+/2+ Throughout all 4 extremities. Flexor plantar responses, bilaterally. Musculoskeletal: Swan neck deformities of the #2 and #3 digits of both hands. GEN EXAM: unremarkable, except for obvious sign of right finger reattachment (mentioned above). COURSE: Repeat lumbar puncture yielded: Opening pressure 20.25cm H20, protein 22, glucose 62, 2RBC, 1WBC. CSF cytology, ACE, cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB), gram stain, cryptococcal antigen, and VDRL were negative. Serum ACE, TSH, FT4 were unremarkable. Neuroophthalmology confirmed her right CN6 palsy and proptosis (OD); and noted her complaint of paresthesias in the V1 and V2 distribution. They saw no evidence of papilledema. Visual field testing was unremarkable. MRI Brain/orbit/neck with gadolinium, 10/20/95, revealed abnormal enhancing signal in the right cavernous sinus and sinus mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses/ethmoid sinuses/frontal sinuses. CXR, 10/20/95, showed a lobulated mass arising from the right hilum. The mass appeared to obstruct the right middle lobe, causing partial collapse of this lobe. Chest CT with contrast, 10/23/95, revealed a 3.2x4.5x4.0cm mass in the right hilar region with impingement on the right lower bronchus. There appeared to be calcification as well as low attenuation regions within the mass. No lymphadenopathy was noted. She underwent bronchoscopy with bronchial brushing and transbronchial aspirate of the right lung on 10/24/95: no tumor cells were identified, GMS stains were negative and there was no evidence of viral changes, fungus or PCP by culture or molecular assay. She underwent right maxillary sinus biopsy and right middle lobe wedge resection and lymph node biopsy on 11/2/95: Caseating granulomatous inflammation with associated inflammatory pseudotumor was found in both sinus and lung biopsy specimens. No sign of cancer was found. Tissue cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB) were negative times 3. The patients case was discussed at Head and Neck Oncology Tumor Board and a differential diagnosis of Sarcoidosis, Histoplasmosis, Wegener's Granulomatosis, were considered. Urine Histoplasmosis Antigen testing on 11/8/95 was 0.9units (normal&lt;1.0): repeat testing on 12/13/95 was 0.8units. ANCA serum titers on 11/8/95 were &lt;1:40 (normal). PPD testing was negative 11/95 (with positive candida and mumps controls). The etiology of this patient's illness was not discovered. She was last seen 4/96 and her diplopia and right CN6 palsy had moderately improved.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nHeadache and double vision.\n\n**History**  \nA 39‑year‑old African‑American woman began having severe, constant pressure‑type headaches in the front and sides of her head during the last week of August 1995. The pain did not spread to other areas. She had no nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light or sound. The headaches happened every day during the day, were less at night, and sometimes woke her up. A few days later she felt numbness and tingling on the right side of her face; the sensation improved but did not disappear. A few days after that she developed double vision that only occurred when both eyes were open; covering one eye fixed it, and the double vision worsened when she looked to the right. She also began walking to the right. She had no weakness. She has been unsteady for many years because of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and was not sure if the unsteadiness was due to poor depth perception from the double vision.\n\nShe was admitted to a local hospital on September 2 1995. A complete blood count on September 2 and a brain MRI with contrast on September 3 were normal. A lumbar puncture on September 3 showed opening pressure 27 cm H₂O, protein 14 mg/dL, glucose 66 mg/dL, no white cells, 3 red cells, negative tests for syphilis, Lyme disease, and myelin basic protein (1.0 ng/mL, normal < 4). No oligoclonal bands were seen. ESR was 76 mm/h. On September 11, ESR was 110 mm/h. Tests for acetylcholine‑receptor antibodies were negative. On September 4, ANA and rheumatoid factor were negative. In July 1994, ANA and RF were negative and ESR was 60 mm/h.\n\n**Medications**  \nTylenol 500 mg every 5–6 hours. No known allergies.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \n1. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed at age 10, now in remission.  \n2. Right fifth finger reattached as a child after traumatic amputation.\n\n**Family History**  \nMother died at 42 of an unknown cancer. Father died at 62 of an unknown cancer. She has four sisters, one brother, and two half‑brothers; one half‑brother has asthma.\n\n**Social History**  \nSingle, lives with sister, does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- Blood pressure 141/84 mm Hg, heart rate 99 bpm, breathing 14 /min, temperature 36.8 °C, weight 82 kg, height 152 cm.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Speech fluent. Mood normal.  \n- Right eye had difficulty moving outward (abduction) and was slightly turned outward. Mild bulging of the right eye. Eye was not tender when touched. Visual fields normal. Optic discs normal. Face symmetrical with normal movement and sensation. Reflexes normal. Muscle strength 5/5 everywhere. Mild difficulty walking on toes. Narrow‑based gait but could walk normally on flat ground; mild difficulty walking on uneven ground. Reflexes 2+/2+ in all limbs. Mild swelling of the fingers (swan‑neck deformities) on both hands.\n\n**Course**  \nA repeat lumbar puncture showed opening pressure 20.25 cm H₂O, protein 22 mg/dL, glucose 62 mg/dL, 2 red cells, 1 white cell. All CSF tests (cytology, ACE, bacterial, fungal, AFB cultures, gram stain, cryptococcal antigen, VDRL) were negative. Blood tests for ACE, TSH, and free T4 were normal. An eye specialist confirmed a right sixth‑nerve palsy and eye bulging, and noted numbness in the upper and lower parts of the face. No swelling of the optic nerve. Visual field test normal. An MRI of the brain, orbit, and neck with contrast on October 20 1995 showed abnormal signal in the right cavernous sinus and thickening of the mucous lining in both maxillary sinuses, ethmoid sinuses, and frontal sinuses. A chest X‑ray on the same day showed a lobulated mass at the right lung hilum, blocking the right middle lobe and causing partial collapse. A chest CT with contrast on October 23, 1995 showed a 3.2 × 4.5 × 4.0 cm mass in the right hilum pressing on the lower right bronchus. The mass had calcification and low‑density areas. No swollen lymph nodes were seen.\n\nShe had a bronchoscopy with brushing and a lung biopsy on October 24, 1995. No tumor cells were found; fungal stains were negative and no viral, fungal, or PCP infection was detected. She had a right maxillary sinus biopsy and a wedge resection of the right middle lobe of the lung with lymph node biopsy on November 2, 1995. Both biopsies showed caseating granulomatous inflammation with an inflammatory pseudotumor. No cancer was found. Cultures for bacteria, fungus, and AFB were negative three times. The case was discussed at a Head and Neck Oncology Tumor Board. Possible diagnoses considered were sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, and Wegener’s granulomatosis. Urine histoplasmosis antigen on November 8, 1995 was 0.9 units (normal < 1.0); repeat on December 13, 1995 was 0.8 units. ANCA titers on November 8 were < 1:40 (normal). A PPD test in November 1995 was negative (controls for candida and mumps were positive). The cause of her illness was not found. She was last seen in April 1996 and her double vision and right sixth‑nerve palsy had improved somewhat."
