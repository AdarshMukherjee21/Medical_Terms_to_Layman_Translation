  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating. The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody. Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion. He spent 3 days in the hospital. He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient. From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection. At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area. HEENT: PERRLA. EOM intact. Oropharynx is clear of lesions. NECK: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. ABDOMEN: Not tender, not distended. Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin. No hepatomegaly. Bowel sounds present. MUSCULOSKELETAL: No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema. NEUROLOGIC: Nonfocal. No asterixis. No costovertebral tenderness. PSYCHE: The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative. LABORATORY DATA: We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63. His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53. We do not have any other results back. No hepatitis panels. No alpha-fetoprotein level. The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause. 1. Epigastric pain. The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time. In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam. His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously. He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician. 2. End-stage liver disease. Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis. We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before. We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past. Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X. The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result. It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time. We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level. We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver. We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B. Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C. The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also. We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before. PSC is extremely unlikely but possible. Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not. Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem. On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly. We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low. I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy. We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy. The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City. We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that. At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily. The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time. I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him. As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal. The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills. He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58. The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication. The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic. Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above. We also discussed nutrition issues. The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day. He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve. He also was advised to stay away from alcohol. His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.",
  "layman": "**History of Present Illness**  \nThe patient is a 55‑year‑old Hispanic man who first came to the office on February 15, 2006 with pain in the upper belly, nausea, dizziness, and bloating. He already knew he had liver cirrhosis. Since that visit we asked him to sign a release form and sent requests for his medical records to the doctors he saw before—Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary‑care doctor in Silver City—but we have not received any information.  \n\nHe was admitted to Gila Medical Center with upper‑belly pain, diarrhea, and confusion and stayed three days. Dr. X followed him, but we still do not have details of what was wrong. The patient says he was diagnosed with a viral infection. At admission he had severe upper‑belly pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n*Vital signs:* weight 107 lb, height 6 ft 1 in, blood pressure 128/67 mm Hg, heart rate 74 bpm, oxygen saturation 98 %. Pain is 3/10 in the upper belly.  \n*Eyes, ears, nose, throat:* pupils equal, round, reactive; eye movements normal; throat clear.  \n*Neck:* flexible, no swollen glands, no thyroid enlargement.  \n*Lungs:* clear to listening and tapping on both sides.  \n*Heart:* regular rhythm, no murmurs.  \n*Abdomen:* not tender or swollen; spleen enlarged about 4 cm below the rib; no liver enlargement; bowel sounds present.  \n*Musculoskeletal:* no cyanosis, clubbing, or swelling.  \n*Neurologic:* normal, no tremor, no back‑to‑back pain.  \n*Psychological:* alert, oriented, cooperative.\n\n**Laboratory Data**  \nWe received a basic metabolic panel from the hospital:  \n- Glucose 79 mg/dL  \n- BUN 9 mg/dL  \n- Creatinine 0.6 mg/dL  \n- Sodium 136 mEq/L  \n- Potassium 3.5 mEq/L  \n- Chloride 104 mEq/L  \n- CO₂ 23.7 mEq/L  \n- Calcium 7.3 mg/dL  \n- Total protein 5.9 g/dL  \n- Albumin 2.5 g/dL  \n- Total bilirubin 5.63 mg/dL  \n\nLiver enzymes: AST 56 U/L, ALT 37 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 165 U/L.  \nAmmonia 53 µmol/L.  \n\nNo hepatitis panel, alpha‑fetoprotein, or other tests were available. The patient mentioned an abdominal ultrasound that was “not impressive,” but we have no record of it.\n\n**Assessment and Plan**  \n\n1. **Upper‑belly pain** – The patient has chronic pain, multiple back surgeries, and long‑term opioid use. In two office visits his abdomen was not painful. The pain does not sound like a blocked bile duct; it has been almost continuous. He probably needs stronger pain control with a higher opioid dose, which should be discussed with his primary‑care doctor.  \n\n2. **End‑stage liver disease** – We still do not know the cause of his cirrhosis.  \n   * We have not received a hepatitis panel or biopsy results.  \n   * He was seen by gastroenterologist Dr. X in Las Cruces; we asked him to contact Dr. X to send any records.  \n   * Repeating unnecessary tests is not reasonable at this time.  \n   * We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha‑fetoprotein.  \n   * We also need the ultrasound from Gila Medical Center; it showed no tumor.  \n   * Knowing his hepatitis status will help decide on hepatitis A and B vaccination.  \n   * The likely cause is hepatitis C, but alcohol‑related cirrhosis cannot be ruled out.  \n   * We may need to check a nuclear antibody.  \n   * Primary sclerosing cholangitis is unlikely but possible.  \n   * Wilson disease is possible; we need to confirm with tests.  \n   * Alpha‑1 antitrypsin deficiency is unlikely because he has no lung problems.  \n   * He has low platelets and an enlarged spleen.  \n   * Bilirubin is high and albumin is low.  \n   * He may have had encephalopathy when admitted; we do not know if INR was checked.  \n   * He had an EGD in 2005 and a colonoscopy in Silver City; we need those results to see if he has varices and if treatment is needed.  \n\n   *Medication and monitoring:*  \n   - Continue lactulose 50 mL three times daily; he tolerates it well.  \n   - Discuss increasing opioid dose with his primary‑care doctor.  \n   - For primary prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in end‑stage liver disease we will try propranolol (Inderal). He received a prescription for 10 mg pills. He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase the dose until his heart rate drops from about 75 bpm to 60‑58 bpm. He was taught how to use propranolol and why we chose it. He will stop the medication if he feels dizzy or his heart rate slows too much.  \n\n   *Other actions:*  \n   - The patient and his wife were advised to contact all previous offices to obtain test results.  \n   - If after two weeks we still have no information, we will repeat all the tests mentioned above.  \n   - We discussed nutrition: he should eat about 25 g of protein per day, avoid overeating protein or starving, and stay away from alcohol.  \n\nHis next visit is scheduled in two weeks, by which time we hope to have all results."
