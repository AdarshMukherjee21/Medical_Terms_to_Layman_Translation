  "medical": "CC: Low Back Pain (LBP) with associated BLE weakness. HX: This 75y/o RHM presented with a 10 day h/o progressively worsening LBP. The LBP started on 12/3/95; began radiating down the RLE, on 12/6/95; then down the LLE, on 12/9/95. By 12/10/95, he found it difficult to walk. On 12/11/95, he drove himself to his local physician, but no diagnosis was rendered. He was given some NSAID and drove home. By the time he got home he had great difficulty walking due to LBP and weakness in BLE, but managed to feed his pets and himself. On 12/12/95 he went to see a local orthopedist, but on the way to his car he crumpled to the ground due to BLE weakness and LBP pain. He also had had BLE numbness since 12/11/95. He was evaluated locally and an L-S-Spine CT scan and L-S Spine X-rays were &quot;negative.&quot; He was then referred to UIHC. MEDS: SLNTC, Coumadin 4mg qd, Propranolol, Procardia XL, Altace, Zaroxolyn. PMH: 1) MI 11/9/78, 2) Cholecystectomy, 3) TURP for BPH 1980's, 4) HTN, 5) Amaurosis Fugax, OD, 8/95 (Mayo Clinic evaluation--TEE (-), but Carotid Doppler (+) but &quot;non-surgical&quot; so placed on Coumadin). FHX: Father died age 59 of valvular heart disease. Mother died of DM. Brother had CABG 8/95. SHX: retired school teacher. 0.5-1.0 pack cigarettes per day for 60 years. EXAM: BP130.56, HR68, RR16, Afebrile. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent without dysarthria. Lucid. Appeared uncomfortable. CN: Unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength in BUE. Lower extremity strength: Hip flexors & extensors 4-/4-, Hip abductors 3+/3+, Hip adductors 5/5, Knee flexors & extensors 4/4-, Ankle flexion 4-/4-, Tibialis Anterior 2/2-, Peronei 3-/3-. Mild atrophy in 4 extremities. Questionable fasciculations in BLE. Spasms illicited on striking quadriceps with reflex hammer (? percussion myotonia). No rigidity and essential normal muscle tone on passive motion. SENSORY: Decreased vibratory sense in stocking distribution from toes to knees in BLE (worse on right). No sensory level. PP/LT/TEMP testing unremarkable. COORD: Normal FNF-RAM. Slowed HKS due to weakness. Station: No pronator drift. Romberg testing not done. Gait: Unable to stand. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE. 1/trace patellae, 0/0 Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Abdominal reflex was present in all four quadrants. Anal reflex was illicited from all four quadrants. No jaw jerk or palmomental reflexes illicited. Rectal: normal rectal tone, guaiac negative stool. GEN EXAM: Bilateral Carotid Bruits, No lymphadenopathy, right inguinal hernia, rhonchi and inspiratory wheeze in both lung fields. COURSE: WBC 11.6, Hgb 13.4, Hct 38%, Plt 295. ESR 40 (normal 0-14), CRP 1.4 (normal &lt;0.4), INR 1.5, PTT 35 (normal), Creatinine 2.1, CK 346. EKG normal. The differential diagnosis included Amyotrophy, Polymyositis, Epidural hematoma, Disc Herniation and Guillain-Barre syndrome. An MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained, 12/13/95. This revealed an L3-4 disc herniation extending inferiorly and behind the L4 vertebral body. This disc was located more on the right than on the left , compromised the right neural foramen, and narrowed the spinal canal. The patient underwent a L3-4 laminectomy and diskectomy and subsequently improved. He was never seen in follow-up at UIHC.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Low back pain and weakness in both legs.  \n\n**History:** A 75‑year‑old retired school teacher had back pain that started on December 3, 1995. The pain got worse over ten days, first spreading to his right leg on December 6, then to his left leg on December 9. By December 10 he had trouble walking. On December 11 he drove to his local doctor, who gave him an NSAID but did not diagnose anything. He still had severe pain and weakness in both legs, but could feed his pets and himself. On December 12 he went to an orthopedist, but while walking to his car he fell because of the leg weakness and pain. He had numbness in both legs since December 11. Local tests (CT and X‑rays of the lower spine) were “negative.” He was then referred to UIHC.  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- SLNTC (statin)  \n- Coumadin 4 mg daily  \n- Propranolol  \n- Procardia XL  \n- Altace (ACE inhibitor)  \n- Zaroxolyn (proton‑pump inhibitor)  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Heart attack (MI) 11/9/1978  \n2. Gallbladder removal  \n3. TURP for enlarged prostate in the 1980s  \n4. High blood pressure (HTN)  \n5. Amaurosis fugax (temporary vision loss) in the right eye 8/95 – evaluated at Mayo Clinic, carotid Doppler positive but not treated surgically, started on Coumadin.  \n\n**Family history:** Father died at 59 from heart valve disease; mother died of diabetes; brother had coronary bypass 8/95.  \n\n**Social history:** Retired teacher, smoked 0.5–1 pack per day for 60 years.  \n\n**Exam (at UIHC):**  \n- Blood pressure 130/56, heart rate 68, breathing 16/min, no fever.  \n- Alert and oriented. Speech normal.  \n- Upper‑arm strength 5/5.  \n- Lower‑leg strength: hip flexors/extensors 4–/4–, abductors 3+–3+, adductors 5/5, knee flexors/extensors 4/4–, ankle flexion 4–/4–, tibialis anterior 2/2–, peroneals 3–/3–. Mild muscle wasting in all four legs, possible twitching.  \n- Reflexes: normal in arms, very weak knee reflexes, absent ankle reflexes. Plantar responses flexor.  \n- Sensation: reduced vibration sense from toes to knees in both legs (worse on the right). No loss of sensation at a specific level.  \n- Coordination: normal finger‑nose and rapid alternating movements; slower heel‑to‑shin due to weakness.  \n- Gait: could not stand.  \n\n**Other findings:**  \n- Bilateral carotid bruits.  \n- No swollen lymph nodes.  \n- Right inguinal hernia.  \n- Rhonchi and wheeze in both lungs.  \n\n**Lab results:**  \n- White cells 11.6, hemoglobin 13.4, hematocrit 38%, platelets 295.  \n- ESR 40 (high), CRP 1.4 (slightly high).  \n- INR 1.5, PTT 35.  \n- Creatinine 2.1, CK 346.  \n- Normal ECG.  \n\n**Differential diagnosis:** Amyotrophy, polymyositis, epidural hematoma, disc herniation, Guillain‑Barré syndrome.  \n\n**Imaging:** An MRI on December 13, 1995 showed a herniated disc at L3‑4 that extended below and behind the L4 vertebra, more on the right side, pressing on the right nerve opening and narrowing the spinal canal.  \n\n**Treatment:** He had a L3‑4 laminectomy and discectomy and improved afterward. He was never seen again at UIHC."
