  "medical": "EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous contrast. CLINICAL INDICATION: Left lower quadrant abdominal pain. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without and with intravenous contrast. Total of 100 mL of Isovue was administered intravenously. Oral contrast was also administered. The lung bases are clear. The liver is enlarged and decreased in attenuation. There are no focal liver masses. There is no intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is slightly distended. The adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney are normal. A 12-mm simple cyst is present in the inferior pole of the right kidney. There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The appendix is normal. There are multiple diverticula in the rectosigmoid. There is evidence of focal wall thickening in the sigmoid colon (image #69) with adjacent fat stranding in association with a diverticulum. These findings are consistent with diverticulitis. No pneumoperitoneum is identified. There is no ascites or focal fluid collection. The aorta is normal in contour and caliber. There is no adenopathy. Degenerative changes are present in the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with diverticulitis. Please see report above.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, done first without contrast and then with a 100 mL IV injection of Isovue. Oral contrast was also given.\n\n**Reason for the scan:** Pain in the lower left side of the abdomen.\n\n**Findings:**\n\n- The lungs at the bottom are clear.\n- The liver is a bit larger than normal and looks less dense, but there are no lumps in it. The bile ducts inside and outside the liver are normal.\n- The gallbladder is a little swollen.\n- The adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney all look normal.\n- The right kidney has a 12‑mm simple cyst in its lower part. The kidney and ureter are not swollen.\n- The appendix looks normal.\n- The rectosigmoid colon has many small pouches (diverticula). One of these pouches in the sigmoid colon shows a thickened wall and nearby fat inflammation, which matches diverticulitis. No free air in the abdomen, no fluid buildup, and no swollen lymph nodes.\n- The aorta looks normal.\n- The lower back spine shows age‑related wear.\n\n**Impression:** The picture is consistent with diverticulitis."
