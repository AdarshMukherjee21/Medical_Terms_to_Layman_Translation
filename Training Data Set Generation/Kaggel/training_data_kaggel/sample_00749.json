  "medical": "LEXISCAN MYOVIEW STRESS STUDY REASON FOR THE EXAM: Chest discomfort. INTERPRETATION: The patient exercised according to the Lexiscan study, received a total of 0.4 mg of Lexiscan IV injection. At peak hyperemic effect, 24.9 mCi of Myoview were injected for the stress imaging and earlier 8.2 mCi were injected for the resting and the usual SPECT and gated SPECT protocol was followed and the data was analyzed using Cedars-Sinai software. The patient did not walk because of prior history of inability to exercise long enough on treadmill. The resting heart rate was 57 with the resting blood pressure 143/94. Maximum heart rate achieved was 90 with a maximum blood pressure unchanged. EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes of reversible ischemia or injury. Subtle nonspecific in III and aVF were seen. Maximum stress test EKG showed inverted T wave from V4 to V6. Normal response to Lexiscan. CONCLUSION: Maximal Lexiscan perfusion with subtle abnormalities non-conclusive. Please refer to the Myoview interpretation. MYOVIEW INTERPRETATION: The left ventricle appeared to be normal in size on both stress and rest with no change between the stress and rest with left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 115 and end-systolic of 51. EF estimated and calculated at 56%. Cardiac perfusion reviewed, showed no reversible defect indicative of myocardium risk and no fixed defect indicative of myocardial scarring. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal stress/rest cardiac perfusion with no indication of ischemia. 2. Normal LV function and low likelihood of significant epicardial coronary narrowing.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam:** Chest discomfort.  \n\n**What happened during the test:**  \nThe patient was given 0.4 mg of Lexiscan through an IV. While the drug was working at its strongest, 24.9 mCi of Myoview was injected for the stress scan, and 8.2 mCi was injected earlier for the resting scan. The usual SPECT and gated SPECT imaging was done and the data were analyzed with Cedars‑Sinai software.  \n\nThe patient could not walk on a treadmill because of a history of not being able to exercise long enough.  \n- Resting heart rate: 57 beats per minute  \n- Resting blood pressure: 143/94 mm Hg  \n- Highest heart rate reached: 90 beats per minute (blood pressure stayed the same)  \n\nAn EKG taken at rest showed a normal rhythm with no major changes that would indicate reversible heart damage. Small, non‑specific changes were seen in leads III and aVF.  \nDuring the stress test, the EKG showed inverted T waves from leads V4 to V6. The response to Lexiscan was normal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Lexiscan test reached maximum blood flow, but the results were not definitive. Please see the Myoview interpretation below.  \n\n**Myoview interpretation:**  \nThe left ventricle looked normal in size both at rest and during stress, with no change between the two.  \n- Left ventricular end‑diastolic volume: 115 mL  \n- End‑systolic volume: 51 mL  \n- Estimated ejection fraction (EF): 56%  \n\nHeart blood flow was examined and showed no reversible problems that would suggest heart muscle risk, and no fixed problems that would suggest scar tissue.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Normal heart blood flow at rest and during stress—no signs of ischemia.  \n2. Normal left‑ventricle function and a low chance of significant blockages in the major heart arteries."
