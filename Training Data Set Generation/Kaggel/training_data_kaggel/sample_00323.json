  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Syncopal episodes with injury. See electrophysiology consultation. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal electrophysiologic studies. 2. No inducible arrhythmia. 3. Procainamide infusion negative for Brugada syndrome. PROCEDURES: 1. Comprehensive electrophysiology studies with attempted arrhythmia induction. 2. IV Procainamide infusion for Brugada syndrome. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient gave informed consent for comprehensive electrophysiologic studies. She received small amounts of intravenous fentanyl and Versed for conscious sedation. Then 1% lidocaine local anesthesia was used. Three catheters were placed via the right femoral vein; 5-French catheters to the right ventricular apex and right atrial appendage; and a 6-French catheter to the His bundle. Later in the procedure, the RV apical catheter was moved to RV outflow tract. ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Conduction intervals in sinus rhythm were normal. Sinus cycle length 768 ms, PA interval 24 ms, AH interval 150 ms, HV interval 46 ms. Sinus node recovery times were also normal at 1114 ms. Corrected sinus node recovery time was normal at 330 ms. One-to-one AV conduction was present to cycle length 480 ms, AH interval 240 ms, HV interval 54 ms. AV nodal effective refractory period was normal, 440 ms at drive cycle length 600 ms. RA-ERP was 250 ms. With ventricular pacing, there was VA disassociation present. Since there was no evidence for dual AV nodal pathways, and poor retrograde conduction, isoproterenol infusion was not performed to look for SVT. Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed at both right ventricular apex and right ventricular outflow tracts. Drive cycle length 600, 500, and 400 ms was used with triple extrastimuli down to troubling intervals of 180 ms, or refractoriness. There was no inducible VT. Longest run was 5 beats of polymorphic VT, which is a nonspecific finding. From the apex 400-600 with 2 extrastimuli were delivered, again with no inducible VT. Procainamide was then infused, 20 mg/kg over 10 minutes. There were no ST segment changes. HV interval after IV Procainamide remained normal at 50 ms. ASSESSMENT: Normal electrophysiologic studies. No evidence for sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block. No inducible supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia, and no evidence for Brugada syndrome. PLAN: The patient will follow up with Dr. X. She recently had an ambulatory EEG. I will plan to see her again on a p.r.n. basis should she develop a recurrent syncopal episodes. Reveal event monitor was considered, but not placed since she has only had one single episode.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑op diagnosis:**  \nThe patient had fainting spells that caused injuries. An electrophysiology (EP) consult was requested.\n\n**Post‑op diagnoses:**  \n1. EP studies were normal.  \n2. No arrhythmia could be triggered.  \n3. A procainamide drug test did not show Brugada syndrome.\n\n**Procedures performed:**  \n1. Full EP study with attempts to provoke arrhythmias.  \n2. Intravenous (IV) procainamide infusion to test for Brugada syndrome.\n\n**Procedure description:**  \nThe patient gave informed consent. She was given small doses of IV fentanyl and Versed for conscious sedation, and local lidocaine for pain control. Three catheters were inserted through the right groin vein: two 5‑French catheters went to the right ventricle and right atrium, and a 6‑French catheter went to the His bundle. Later the right‑ventricle catheter was moved to the outflow tract.\n\n**EP findings:**  \n- Normal conduction while the heart was beating normally.  \n- Heart rhythm timing (sinus cycle length, PA, AH, HV intervals) were all within normal ranges.  \n- The time it takes the sinus node to recover was normal.  \n- One‑to‑one conduction between atria and ventricles was normal up to a cycle length of 480 ms.  \n- The AV node’s refractory period was normal.  \n- No evidence of dual AV node pathways or poor retrograde conduction, so a drug test for SVT was not done.  \n- Ventricular pacing showed atrial‑ventricular dissociation.  \n- Programmed stimulation of the right ventricle (both apex and outflow tract) with various cycle lengths and extra beats was performed. No sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) was induced. The longest run was 5 beats of polymorphic VT, which is a nonspecific finding.  \n- A procainamide infusion (20 mg/kg over 10 min) was given; it did not change the ST segment or the HV interval (still normal at 50 ms).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll EP studies were normal. There is no sinus node or AV block problem, no inducible SVT or VT, and no Brugada syndrome.\n\n**Plan:**  \nThe patient will see Dr. X for follow‑up. She recently had an ambulatory EEG. I will see her again as needed if she has more fainting spells. A Reveal event monitor was considered but not used because she has had only one episode."
