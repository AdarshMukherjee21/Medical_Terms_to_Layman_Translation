  "medical": "NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral ulnar sensory responses are absent. Bilateral median sensory distal latencies are prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude. The left radial sensory response is normal and robust. Left sural response is absent. Left median motor distal latency is prolonged with attenuated evoked response amplitude. Conduction velocity across the forearm is mildly slowed. Right median motor distal latency is prolonged with a normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity. The left ulnar motor distal latency is prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude both below and above the elbow. Conduction velocities across the forearm and across the elbow are prolonged. Conduction velocity proximal to the elbow is normal. The right median motor distal latency is normal with normal evoked response amplitudes at the wrist with a normal evoked response amplitude at the wrist. There is mild diminution of response around the elbow. Conduction velocity slows across the elbow. The left common peroneal motor distal latency evoked response amplitude is normal with slowed conduction velocity across the calf and across the fibula head. F-waves are prolonged. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the left arm and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles as well as middle thoracic muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, left abductor pollicis brevis, and first dorsal interosseous muscles. There were signs of chronic reinnervation in triceps, extensor digitorum communis, flexor pollicis longus as well first dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis muscles. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: 1. A sensory motor length-dependent neuropathy consistent with diabetes. 2. A severe left ulnar neuropathy. This is probably at the elbow, although definitive localization cannot be made. 3. Moderate-to-severe left median neuropathy. This is also probably at the carpal tunnel, although definitive localization cannot be made. 4. Right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, mild. 5. Right median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, moderate. 6. A left C8 radiculopathy (double crush syndrome). 7. There is no evidence for thoracic radiculitis. The patient has made very good response with respect to his abdominal pain since starting Neurontin. He still has mild allodynia and is waiting for authorization to get insurance coverage for his Lidoderm patch. He is still scheduled for MRI of C-spine and T-spine. I will see him in followup after the above scans.",
  "layman": "**NERVE TEST RESULTS**\n\nThe test looked at how well nerves in both arms and legs carry signals.\n\n- **Sensory nerves (the ones that feel touch):**  \n  - The ulnar nerves on both sides do not send signals at all.  \n  - The median nerves on both sides are slow and the signals are weak.  \n  - The left radial nerve works normally.  \n  - The left sural nerve (a sensory nerve in the leg) does not send signals.  \n  - The left median nerve’s signal is slow and weak.  \n  - The left ulnar nerve’s signal is slow and very weak both above and below the elbow.  \n  - The right median nerve’s signal is slow but the strength of the signal is normal.  \n  - The left common peroneal nerve (a motor nerve in the leg) sends a normal signal but the speed of the signal is slow in the calf and near the fibula head.  \n\n- **Motor nerves (the ones that move muscles):**  \n  - The left ulnar and median nerves are slow.  \n  - The right median nerve is normal at the wrist but a little weaker around the elbow.  \n  - The speed of signals across the forearm is a bit slow.  \n  - The speed of signals across the elbow is slow, but the speed above the elbow is normal.  \n  - The left common peroneal nerve’s signal is normal in strength but slow in the calf.  \n\n- **F‑waves (signals that travel back up the nerve):**  \n  - These are slow.\n\n**EMG (muscle test) results**\n\nA needle was used to test muscles in the left arm, back near the spine, and the middle of the back.\n\n- There is spontaneous muscle activity in the lower back near the spine, the left thumb‑abductor muscle, and the first muscle that spreads the fingers.  \n- There are signs that some muscles (triceps, finger‑extending muscle, thumb‑flexing muscle, and the first finger‑spreading and thumb‑abductor muscles) have been trying to recover from long‑term nerve damage.\n\n**Overall findings**\n\nThe electrical study shows several problems:\n\n1. A long‑distance nerve problem that is typical for diabetes.  \n2. A severe problem with the left ulnar nerve, probably near the elbow (exact spot unclear).  \n3. A moderate‑to‑severe problem with the left median nerve, probably in the wrist area (exact spot unclear).  \n4. A mild problem with the right ulnar nerve at the elbow.  \n5. A moderate problem with the right median nerve at the wrist, typical of carpal tunnel syndrome.  \n6. A left C8 spinal nerve problem (double‑crush).  \n7. No evidence of a spinal nerve problem in the middle back.\n\nThe patient has responded well to Neurontin for abdominal pain, still has mild allodynia, and is waiting for insurance approval for a Lidoderm patch. An MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine is still scheduled. The doctor will follow up after those scans."
