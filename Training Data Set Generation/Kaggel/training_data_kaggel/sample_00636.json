Right carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Right olecranon bursitis. PROCEDURES: 1. Right ulnar nerve transposition. 2. Right carpal tunnel release. 3. Right excision of olecranon bursa. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. FINDINGS: Thickened transverse carpal ligament and partially subluxed ulnar nerve. SUMMARY: After informed consent was obtained and verified, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, his right arm was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion. After elevation and exsanguination with an Esmarch, the tourniquet was inflated. The carpal tunnel was performed first with longitudinal incision in the palm carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally. A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally. After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon. The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected. A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case. The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed. The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally. The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided. The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns. The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight. The wound was irrigated. The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples. Prior to the tourniquet being deflated, the subcutaneous dissection was carried out over to the olecranon bursa, where the loose fragments were excised with a rongeurs as well as abrading the ulnar cortex and excision of hypertrophic bursa. A posterior splint was applied. Marcaine was injected into the incisions and the splint was reinforced with tape. He was awakened from the anesthesia and taken to recovery room in a stable condition. Final needle, instrument, and sponge counts were correct.",

Right carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Right olecranon bursitis.  \n\nPROCEDURES: 1. Right ulnar nerve transposition. 2. Right carpal tunnel release. 3. Right excision of olecranon bursa.  \n\nANESTHESIA: General.  \nBLOOD LOSS: Minimal.  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \n\nFINDINGS: Thickened transverse carpal ligament and partially subluxed ulnar nerve.  \n\nSUMMARY: After the patient gave informed consent, he was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. General anesthesia was started without problems. The right arm was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The arm was first exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and a tourniquet was applied.  \n\nThe carpal tunnel release was done first. A long cut was made in the palm, through the skin and soft tissue. The palm’s fascia was split to expose the thickened transverse carpal ligament, which was cut lengthwise. A small instrument (Freer) was used to separate the ligament from the underlying tissues, moving the cut both up and down the tunnel. Once the ligament was fully released, the wound was washed and closed with nylon sutures.  \n\nNext, the elbow was approached from the inside (medial side). The skin and subcutaneous tissue were cut open. The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was found and kept safe during the surgery. The ulnar nerve was seen slipping over the top of the medial epicondyle and was swollen and flattened. The nerve was freed both above and below the elbow. The medial intramuscular septum was removed and the fascia of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle was split. The nerve’s inner branch and its first branch to the small finger were cut. The nerve was then moved (transposed) to a new position. It did not have any tightness or sharp turns. A sling of fascia was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the surrounding tissue, allowing the nerve to move easily when the elbow flexed or extended. The wound was washed again. The tourniquet was released and the bleeding stopped well. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2‑0 Vicryl sutures and the skin was closed with staples.  \n\nWhile the tourniquet was still on, the surgeon went further into the elbow area to the olecranon bursa. Loose pieces were removed with a rongeur, the outer bone was abraded, and the thickened bursa was cut away. A posterior splint was put on the arm. A local anesthetic (Marcaine) was injected into the incisions and the splint was secured with tape. The patient woke up from anesthesia and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. All surgical items were counted correctly."
