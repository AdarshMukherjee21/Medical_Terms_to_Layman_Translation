  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM: XYZ was seen by Dr. ABC for an FCR tendinitis. We do not have his reports, but by history she has had two cortisone shots. She plays musical instruments, and it does bother her from time to time. She was considering surgery, but she takes ibuprofen and it seems to be well-controlled. She is here now for consultation. CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: The patient is alert and oriented times three in no acute distress. Skin: No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis. Vascular: 2+ radial and ulnar artery pulses. Musculoskeletal: Wrist, elbow, shoulder and neck exams reveal no focal findings except for some tenderness to palpation over the FCR tendon on the scaphoid tubercle, but there is no SL instability and no signs of lunotriquetral instability or midcarpal instability. The DRUJ is stable. Flexion/extension of the fingers is all intact. Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no other focal tenderness to palpation. Neurologic: Negative Tinel's, Phalen's and compression median nerve test. APB, EPL and first dorsal interosseous have 5/5 strength. Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no neurologic compromise. Gait: Normal. Neck: Negative Spurling sign. Negative signs of thoracic outlet. HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive with no asymmetry. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: By history, possible FCR tendinitis. EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN: At this point, we have asked her some questions again. She is not that sore at this point, and she has had a couple of cortisone shots. Without being the initial treating physician, she has FCR tendinitis that fails to respond to cortisone shots. She is a candidate for an FCR tunnel release. It has been described and is effective for those patients with that problem. My only consideration would be, if the patient should choose, to get an MRI when she is symptomatic to confirm the FCR tendinitis. She will followup with Dr. ABC as needed or come back to us when she is thinking more along the lines of surgery.",
  "layman": "**History of the problem:**  \nXYZ saw Dr. ABC for pain in the FCR tendon (a tendon in the wrist). We don’t have the reports, but she has had two cortisone shots. She plays musical instruments and the pain bothers her sometimes. She thought about surgery, but she takes ibuprofen and the pain is under control. She is here for a check‑up.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- **General:** She is awake, aware of time, place and person, and not in any distress.  \n- **Skin:** No sores or excessive sweating.  \n- **Blood flow:** Good pulses in the wrist arteries.  \n- **Muscles and joints:** The wrist, elbow, shoulder and neck look normal. There is some tenderness over the FCR tendon near the scaphoid tubercle, but no instability in the wrist joints. The joint between the radius and ulna is stable. Finger movement is normal. No other tenderness in the arm.  \n- **Nerves:** Tests for nerve irritation (Tinel’s, Phalen’s, compression) are negative. Key hand muscles have full strength. No nerve problems in the arm.  \n- **Walking:** Normal.  \n- **Neck:** No signs of nerve compression.  \n- **Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat:** Eyes react normally and are symmetrical.\n\n**Clinical impression:**  \nShe likely has FCR tendon inflammation.\n\n**Evaluation and plan:**  \nWe asked her more questions. She isn’t very sore now and has had a few cortisone shots. Since she is not the original doctor, we note that her FCR tendon inflammation hasn’t fully responded to cortisone. She could be a candidate for a surgical release of the FCR tunnel, which can help people with this problem. If she prefers, she could get an MRI when the pain returns to confirm the diagnosis. She will see Dr. ABC again if needed or come back to us if she wants to discuss surgery further."
