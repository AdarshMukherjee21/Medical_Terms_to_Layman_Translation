  "medical": "CC: Vertigo. HX: This 61y/o RHF experienced a 2-3 minute episode of lightheadedness while driving home from the dentist in 5/92. In 11/92, while eating breakfast, she suddenly experienced vertigo. This was immediately followed by nausea and several episodes of vomiting. The vertigo lasted 2-3minutes. She retired to her room for a 2 hour nap after vomiting. When she awoke, the symptoms had resolved. On 1/13/93 she had an episode of right arm numbness lasting 4-5hours. There was no associated weakness, HA, dysarthria, dysphagia, visual change, vertigo or lightheadedness. OUTSIDE RECORDS: 12/16/92 Carotid Doppler (RICA 30-40%, LICA 10-20%). 12/4/92, brain MRI revealed a right cerebellar hypodensity consistent with infarct. MEDS: Zantac 150mg bid, Proventil MDI bid, Azmacort MDI bid, Doxycycline 100mg bid, Premarin 0.625mg qd, Provera 2.5mg qd. ASA 325mg qd. PMH: 1)MDD off antidepressants since 6/92. 2)asthma. 3)allergic rhinitis. 4)chronic sinusitis. 5)s/p Caldwell-Luc 1978, and nasal polypectomy. 6) GERD. 7)h/o elevated TSH. 8)hypercholesterolemia 287 on 11/20/93. 9)h/o heme positive stool: BE 11/24/92 and UGI 11/25/92 negative. FHX: Father died of a thoracic aortic aneurysm, age 71. Mother died of stroke, age 81. SHX: Married. One son deceased. Salesperson. Denied tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP (RUE)132/72 LUE (136/76). HR67 RR16 Afebrile. 59.2kg. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Thought lucid. CN: unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: No deficits appreciated. Coord: unremarkable. Station: no pronator drift, truncal ataxia, or Romberg sign. Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout BUE and at patellae. 1/1 at Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: Obese. COURSE: CBC, GS, PT/PTT, UA were unremarkable. The patient was admitted with a working diagnosis of posterior circulation TIA and history of cerebellar stroke. She was placed on Ticlid 250mg bid. HCT,1/15/93: low density focus in the right medial and posterior cerebellar hemisphere. MRI and MRA, 1/18/93, revealed a well circumscribed lesion within the posterior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere suggestive of vascular malformation (e.g. cavernous angioma. An abnormal vascular blush was seen on the MRA. This area appeared to be supplied by one of the external carotid arteries (which one is was not specified). this finding maybe suggestive of a vascular malformation. 1/20/93 Cerebral Angiogram: The right cerebellar hemisphere lesion seen on MRI as a possible cavernous angioma was not seen on angiography. Upon review of the MRI and HCT the lesion was felt to probably represent an old infarction with hemosiderin deposition. The &quot;vascular blush&quot; seen on MRA was no visualized on angiography. The patient was discharged home on 1/25/93.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: Vertigo.  \nHistory: A 61‑year‑old woman had a 2‑3 minute episode of lightheadedness while driving home from the dentist in May 1992. In November 1992, while eating breakfast, she suddenly felt vertigo, followed by nausea and several vomits. The vertigo lasted 2‑3 minutes. She slept in her room for two hours after vomiting. When she woke up, the symptoms were gone. On January 13 1993 she had numbness in her right arm that lasted 4‑5 hours. There was no weakness, headache, trouble speaking, trouble swallowing, vision changes, vertigo, or lightheadedness.\n\nOutside records:  \n- December 16 1992 carotid Doppler showed 30‑40 % blockage in the right internal carotid artery and 10‑20 % in the left.  \n- December 4 1992 brain MRI showed a small area of damage in the right cerebellum, consistent with a stroke.  \n\nMedications: Zantac 150 mg twice a day, Proventil inhaler twice a day, Azmacort inhaler twice a day, Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day, Premarin 0.625 mg once a day, Provera 2.5 mg once a day, and Aspirin 325 mg once a day.  \n\nPast medical history:  \n1) Major depressive disorder, stopped antidepressants in June 1992.  \n2) Asthma.  \n3) Allergic rhinitis.  \n4) Chronic sinusitis.  \n5) Had a Caldwell‑Luc surgery in 1978 and a nasal polypectomy.  \n6) GERD.  \n7) History of high TSH.  \n8) High cholesterol (287) on November 20 1993.  \n9) History of blood in stool: a barium enema on November 24 1992 and an upper GI study on November 25 1992 were negative.  \n\nFamily history: Father died of a thoracic aortic aneurysm at 71. Mother died of a stroke at 81.  \n\nSocial history: Married, one son died. Works as a salesperson. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.\n\nPhysical exam: Blood pressure 132/72 on the right arm and 136/76 on the left. Heart rate 67, breathing 16, no fever. Weight 59.2 kg. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Speech was fluent and clear. Thoughts were normal. Cranial nerves were normal. Muscle strength was 5/5 everywhere with normal size and tone. Sensation was normal. Coordination was normal. No drift when holding arms out, no balance problems, and no Romberg sign. Gait was not tested. Reflexes were normal: 2/2 in both arms and knees, 1/1 in ankles. Plantar reflexes were normal (flexor). General exam: obese.\n\nCourse: Blood tests (CBC, basic metabolic panel, clotting tests, urine) were normal. She was admitted with a suspected temporary blockage in the back part of the brain (posterior circulation TIA) and a history of a cerebellar stroke. She was started on Ticlid 250 mg twice a day. A head CT on January 15 1993 showed a low‑density spot in the right middle and back part of the cerebellum. An MRI and MRA on January 18, 1993 showed a clear lesion in the back of the right cerebellum that looked like a blood vessel abnormality, such as a cavernous angioma. The MRA also showed an abnormal blood flow “blush” supplied by one of the external carotid arteries (the specific one was not identified). This could indicate a vascular malformation. A cerebral angiogram on January 20 1993 did not show the lesion seen on MRI. After reviewing the MRI and CT, doctors thought the lesion was likely an old stroke with iron deposits (hemosiderin). The abnormal blush seen on the MRA was not seen on the angiogram. She was discharged home on January 25 1993."
