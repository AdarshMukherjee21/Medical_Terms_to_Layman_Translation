  "medical": "CC: HA and vision loss. HX: 71 y/o RHM developed a cataclysmic headache on 11/5/92 associated with a violent sneeze. The headache lasted 3-4 days. On 11/7/92, he had acute pain and loss of vision in the left eye. Over the following day his left pupil enlarged and his left upper eyelid began to droop. He was seen locally and a brain CT showed no sign of bleeding, but a tortuous left middle cerebral artery was visualized. The patient was transferred to UIHC 11/12/92. FHX: HTN, stroke, coronary artery disease, melanoma. SHX: Quit smoking 15 years ago. MEDS: Lanoxin, Capoten, Lasix, KCL, ASA, Voltaren, Alupent MDI PMH: CHF, Atrial Fibrillation, Obesity, Anemia, Duodenal Ulcer, Spinal AVM resection 1986 with residual T9 sensory level, hyperreflexia and bilateral babinski signs, COPD. EXAM: 35.5C, BP 140/91, P86, RR20. Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. CN: No light perception OS, Pupils: 3/7 decreasing to 2/7 on exposure to light (i.e., fixed/dilated pupil OS). Upon neutral gaze the left eye deviated laterally and inferiorly. There was complete ptosis OS. On downward gaze their was intorsion OS. The left eye could not move superiorly, medially or effectively downward, but could move laterally. EOM were full OD. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor, Coordination, Station and Gait testing were unremarkable. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick and light touch below T9 (old). Muscle stretch reflexes were increased (3+/3+) in both lower extremities and there were bilateral babinski signs (old). The upper extremity reflexes were symmetrical (2/2). Cardiovascular exam revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm and lung sounds were coarse bilaterally. The rest of the general exam was unremarkable. LAB: CBC, PT/PTT, General Screen were unremarkable except for a BUN 21mg/DL. CSF: protein 88mg/DL, glucose 58mg/DL, RBC 2800/mm3, WBC 1/mm3. ANA, RF, TSH, FT4 were WNL. IMPRESSION: CN3 palsy and loss of vision. Differential diagnosis: temporal arteritis, aneurysm, intracranial mass. COURSE: The outside Brain CT revealed a tortuous left MCA. A four-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed a dolichoectatic basilar artery and tortuous LICA. There was no evidence of aneursym. Transesophageal Echocardiogram revealed atrial enlargement only. Neuroopthalmologic evaluation revealed: Loss of color vision and visual acuity OS, RAPD OS, bilateral optic disk pallor (OS &gt; OD), CN3 palsy and bilateral temporal field loss, OS &gt;&gt; OD . ESR, CRP, MRI were recommended to rule out temporal arteritis and intracranial mass. ESR 29mm/Hr, CRP 4.3mg/DL (high) , The patient was placed on prednisone. Temporal artery biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. MRI scan could not be obtained due to patient weight. Sellar CT was done instead: coronal sections revealed sellar enlargement and upward bowing of the diaphragm sella suggesting a pituitary mass. In retrospect sellar enlargement could be seen on the angiogram X-rays. Differential consideration was given to cystic pituitary adenoma, noncalcified craniopharyngioma, or Rathke's cleft cyst with solid component. The patient refused surgery. He was seen in Neuroopthalmology Clinic 2/18/93 and was found to have mild recovery of vision OS and improved visual fields. Aberrant reinnervation of the 3rd nerve was noted as there was constriction of the pupil (OS) on adduction, downgaze and upgaze. The upper eyelid, OS, elevated on adduction and down gaze, OS. EOM movements were otherwise full and there was no evidence of ptosis. In retrospect he was felt to have suffered pituitary apoplexy in 11/92.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nThe patient, a 71‑year‑old man, came to the hospital with a severe headache and loss of vision.\n\n**History of Present Illness**  \nOn November 5, 1992 he had a sudden, very painful headache that started after a violent sneeze. The pain lasted 3–4 days. On November 7 he felt sharp pain and suddenly could not see with his left eye. The next day his left pupil became very large and his left upper eyelid drooped. A local CT scan showed no bleeding but did show a twisted left middle cerebral artery. He was transferred to UIHC on November 12.\n\n**Family and Social History**  \n- Family: high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, melanoma.  \n- Social: quit smoking 15 years ago.\n\n**Current Medications**  \nLanoxin, Capoten, Lasix, potassium chloride, aspirin, Voltaren, Alupent.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \nCongestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, obesity, anemia, duodenal ulcer, spinal AVM removed in 1986 (still has numbness below T9, hyperactive reflexes, and abnormal foot reflexes), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- Temperature 35.5 °C, blood pressure 140/91 mm Hg, pulse 86 bpm, breathing 20 breaths/min.  \n- He was awake, alert, and knew who he was, where he was, and what day it was.  \n- **Eye exam**: He could not see light in his left eye. His left pupil was fixed and dilated (3 mm, then 2 mm with light). The left eye turned outward and downward. The left eyelid was fully drooping. When he looked down, the left eye turned inward. The left eye could not move up, in, or down, but could move sideways. The right eye moved normally.  \n- The rest of his cranial nerve exam was normal.  \n- Muscle strength, coordination, balance, and walking were normal.  \n- Sensation was reduced below the T9 level.  \n- Reflexes in both legs were brisk (3+/3+) and the foot reflexes were abnormal (Babinski sign). Reflexes in the arms were normal (2/2).  \n- Heart rhythm was irregular. Lung sounds were rough on both sides. The rest of the exam was normal.\n\n**Laboratory Tests**  \nCBC, clotting tests, and a general screen were normal except for a BUN of 21 mg/dL.  \nCerebrospinal fluid: protein 88 mg/dL, glucose 58 mg/dL, red cells 2800/mm³, white cells 1/mm³.  \nAutoimmune and thyroid tests (ANA, RF, TSH, FT4) were within normal limits.\n\n**Impression**  \nDamage to the third cranial nerve (CN III) and loss of vision.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis**  \n- Temporal arteritis  \n- Aneurysm  \n- Brain tumor\n\n**Course of Treatment**  \nThe outside CT showed a twisted left middle cerebral artery. A detailed angiogram of all four major brain arteries showed a stretched basilar artery and a twisted left internal carotid artery, but no aneurysm. An echo of the heart showed only an enlarged atrium.  \n\nA neuro‑ophthalmology evaluation found:  \n- Loss of color vision and visual sharpness in the left eye  \n- A relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye  \n- Pale optic discs in both eyes (more pale on the left)  \n- Third‑nerve palsy  \n- Loss of vision in the outer part of both visual fields (much worse on the left)\n\nInflammation markers were slightly high (ESR 29 mm/hr, CRP 4.3 mg/dL). The patient was started on prednisone. A temporal artery biopsy showed no inflammation. An MRI could not be done because of his weight, so a CT of the pituitary area was performed. It showed enlargement of the pituitary region and an upward bowing of the diaphragm sella, suggesting a pituitary tumor. The angiogram X‑rays also hinted at this enlargement. Possible diagnoses were a cystic pituitary adenoma, a non‑calcified craniopharyngioma, or a Rathke’s cleft cyst with a solid part. The patient declined surgery.\n\nAt the neuro‑ophthalmology clinic on February 18, 1993 he had a slight improvement in left‑eye vision and better visual fields. The third nerve had partially re‑innervated, as shown by a constricted pupil when the eye moved inward, down, or up. The left upper eyelid was higher when the eye moved inward or down. Eye movements were otherwise normal and there was no drooping. In hindsight, the patient likely had a pituitary hemorrhage (apoplexy) in November 1992."
