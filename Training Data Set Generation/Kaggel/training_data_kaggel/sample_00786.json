  "medical": "EXAM: Chest PA & Lateral. REASON FOR EXAM: Shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumothorax versus left-sided effusion. INTERPRETATION: There has been interval development of a moderate left-sided pneumothorax with near complete collapse of the left upper lobe. The lower lobe appears aerated. There is stable, diffuse, bilateral interstitial thickening with no definite acute air space consolidation. The heart and pulmonary vascularity are within normal limits. Left-sided port is seen with Groshong tip at the SVC/RA junction. No evidence for acute fracture, malalignment, or dislocation. IMPRESSION: 1. Interval development of moderate left-sided pneumothorax with corresponding left lung atelectasis. 2. Rest of visualized exam nonacute/stable. 3. Left central line appropriately situated and stable. 4. Preliminary report was issued at time of dictation. Dr. X was called for results.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Chest X‑ray (front and side view).  \nREASON FOR EXAM: Shortness of breath – doctors want to see if there is a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) or fluid on the left side.  \n\nINTERPRETATION: A moderate-sized air pocket has appeared on the left side, causing almost the entire upper part of the left lung to collapse. The lower part of that lung is still breathing normally. The lung tissue on both sides shows a mild, long‑standing thickening, but there is no new infection or fluid in the air spaces. The heart and blood vessels look normal. A left‑side central line (a tube for medication or fluids) is in place, with its tip at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. There are no new broken bones, misalignments, or dislocations.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. A moderate left‑side pneumothorax has developed, causing collapse of part of the left lung.  \n2. The rest of the chest looks stable and not acute.  \n3. The central line is correctly positioned and stable.  \n4. A preliminary report was given when the doctor spoke. Dr. X was called for the results."
