  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Placement of left ventriculostomy via twist drill. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Massive intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Massive intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a man with a history of massive intracranial hemorrhage and hydrocephalus with intraventricular hemorrhage. His condition is felt to be critical. In a desperate attempt to relieve increased intracranial pressure, we have proposed placing a ventriculostomy. I have discussed this with patient's wife who agrees and asked that we proceed emergently. After a sterile prep, drape, and shaving of the hair over the left frontal area, this area is infiltrated with local anesthetic. Subsequently a 1 cm incision was made over Kocher's point. Hemostasis was obtained. Then a twist drill was made over this area. Bones strips were irrigated away. The dura was perforated with a spinal needle. A Camino monitor was connected and zeroed. This was then passed into the left lateral ventricle on the first pass. Excellent aggressive very bloody CSF under pressure was noted. This stopped, slowed, and some clots were noted. This was irrigated and then CSF continued. Initial opening pressures were 30, but soon arose to 80 or a 100. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The wound was stitched shut and the ventricular drain was then connected to a drainage bag. Platelets and FFP as well as vitamin K have been administered and ordered simultaneously with the placement of this device to help prevent further clotting or bleeding.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** A left ventriculostomy was performed using a twist drill.\n\n**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Large bleeding inside the brain’s ventricles, causing fluid buildup (hydrocephalus) and high pressure inside the skull.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same as before.\n\n**Why the procedure was needed:** The patient, a man, has had a severe brain bleed and fluid buildup that is putting pressure on his brain. The doctors believe his condition is critical. To lower the pressure, they decided to place a ventriculostomy. The patient’s wife was informed and agreed to proceed right away.\n\n**What was done:**  \n1. The left front part of the skull was cleaned, covered, and the hair was shaved.  \n2. Local anesthetic was injected.  \n3. A 1‑centimeter cut was made at a standard spot (Kocher’s point).  \n4. Bleeding was stopped.  \n5. A twist drill was used to create a hole.  \n6. Bone fragments were washed away.  \n7. A spinal needle pierced the dura (the outer brain covering).  \n8. A Camino monitor was attached and calibrated.  \n9. The monitor was inserted into the left lateral ventricle on the first try.  \n10. A large amount of bloody fluid (CSF) came out under pressure, then slowed and clotted. The area was washed, and fluid flow resumed.  \n11. Initial pressure readings were 30, then rose to 80–100.  \n12. The patient tolerated the procedure well.  \n13. The wound was stitched closed and the drain was connected to a drainage bag.  \n14. Platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K were given at the same time to help prevent further bleeding."
