  "medical": "PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Change in bowel function. POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Proctosigmoiditis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with biopsy. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation. POSTPROCEDURE CONDITION: Stable. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 33-year-old with a recent change in bowel function and hematochezia. He is here for colonoscopy. He understands the risks and wishes to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite where he was placed in left lateral Sims position, underwent IV sedation. Digital rectal examination was performed, which showed no masses, and a boggy prostate. The colonoscope was placed in the rectum and advanced, under direct vision, to the cecum. In the rectum and sigmoid, there were ulcerations, edema, mucosal abnormalities, and loss of vascular pattern consistent with proctosigmoiditis. Multiple random biopsies were taken of the left and right colon to see if this was in fact pan colitis. RECOMMENDATIONS: Follow up with me in 2 weeks and we will begin Canasa suppositories.",

He came for a colonoscopy, understands the risks, and wants to go ahead.  \n\nPROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the endoscopy room, laid on his left side, and given IV sedation. A digital rectal exam was done, showing no lumps and a soft prostate. A colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and carefully advanced to the cecum. In the rectum and sigmoid colon, there were ulcerations, swelling, abnormal lining, and loss of the normal blood vessel pattern, all signs of proctosigmoiditis. Several random biopsies were taken from the left and right sides of the colon to check if the inflammation involved the whole colon.  \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Return for a follow‑up in 2 weeks, at which time we will start Canasa suppositories."
