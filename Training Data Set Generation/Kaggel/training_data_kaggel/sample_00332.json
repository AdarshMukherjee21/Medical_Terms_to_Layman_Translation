Physical examination is unremarkable. There is no family history of colon cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Procedure and possible complications were explained to the patient. Ample opportunity was provided to her to ask questions. Informed consent was obtained. She was placed in left lateral position. Inspection of perianal area was normal. Digital exam of the rectum was normal. Video Olympus colonoscope was introduced into the rectum. The sigmoid colon is very tortuous. The instrument was advanced to the cecum after placing the patient in a supine position. The patient was well prepared and a good examination was possible. The cecum was identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. Images were taken. The instrument was then gradually withdrawn while examining the colon again in a circumferential manner. Few diverticula were encountered in the sigmoid and descending colon. Retroflex view of the rectum was unremarkable. No polyps or malignancy was identified. After obtaining images, the air was suctioned. Instrument was withdrawn from the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Colonoscopy was performed to cecum and demonstrates the following: 1. Mild-to-moderate diverticulosis. 2.

  "layman": "**Procedure:** Colonoscopy\n\n**Pre‑procedure diagnosis:**  \nA 56‑year‑old woman came in for a routine colon screening. She has bowel movements every other day, no blood in her stool, and no abdominal pain. Her medical history includes high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and acid reflux. She has had two C‑sections. A physical exam was normal and no family history of colon cancer was noted.\n\n**Post‑procedure diagnosis:**  \nDiverticulosis (small pouches in the colon).\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe doctor explained the colonoscopy and possible risks, and she was given a chance to ask questions. She gave her consent. She lay on her left side. The doctor checked her anus and did a normal digital rectal exam. A video colonoscope was inserted into her rectum. The sigmoid colon was very winding, but the scope was advanced to the cecum (the beginning of the large intestine) after she was turned onto her back. She was well prepared, so the exam was clear. The cecum was found by the ileocecal valve and the opening of the appendix. Pictures were taken. The scope was then slowly pulled back while the colon was examined again all around. A few diverticula were seen in the sigmoid and descending colon. A backward view of the rectum was normal. No polyps or cancer were found. After taking pictures, the air was removed and the scope was taken out. She tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.\n\n**Summary of findings:**  \nThe colonoscopy reached the cecum and showed mild‑to‑moderate diverticulosis.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. She was given information about diverticulosis and general dietary advice.  \n2. She was advised to have another colonoscopy in 10 years."
