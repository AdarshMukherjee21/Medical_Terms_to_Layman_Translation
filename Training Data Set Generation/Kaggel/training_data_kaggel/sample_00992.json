Preparation was fair allowing examination of 85% of mucosa after washing and cleaning with tap water through the scope. The terminal ileum was intubated through the ileocecal valve for a 5 cm extent. Terminal ileum mucosa looked normal. Then the scope was withdrawn while examining the mucosa carefully including the retroflexed views of the rectum. No polyp, no diverticulum and no bleeding source was identified. The patient was assessed upon completion of the procedure. Okay to discharge once criteria met.

  "layman": "**Reason for the procedure:** Low iron levels causing anemia.  \n**What was done:** A colonoscopy, which also looked at the end of the small intestine (terminal ileum).  \n**Result after the procedure:** Everything looked normal.  \n**Time the scope was in the body:** 15 minutes.  \n**Scope used:** CF‑H180AL.  \n**Medications given:** 100 mcg of fentanyl and 10 mg of versed.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nBefore the procedure, the doctor explained the goals, possible risks (like bleeding or a hole in the bowel), side effects of the medicines, and other options. All questions were answered and a final check was done.  \nAfter the patient was given the right amount of IV sedation, the flexible video scope was gently inserted through the rectum and moved up to the cecum without any trouble. The valve between the colon and small intestine looked normal. The prep was good enough to see 85 % of the lining after washing it with tap water. The scope was then passed into the terminal ileum for about 5 cm, where the lining also looked normal.  \nWhile pulling the scope back, the doctor carefully examined the lining, including a backward view of the rectum. No growths, holes, or bleeding spots were found.  \nAfter the scope was removed, the patient was checked and was cleared to leave once all safety criteria were met.  \n\n**Next steps:** Follow up with your primary care doctor."
