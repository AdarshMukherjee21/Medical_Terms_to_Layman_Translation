OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram. FINDINGS: The patient had essentially a dead gallbladder with stones and positive wide bile/pus coming from the gallbladder. COMPLICATIONS: None. EBL: Scant. SPECIMEN REMOVED: Gallbladder with stones. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion under general anesthesia. A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus. Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization. Once this complete, insufflation was begun. Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant. Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored. The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis. This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder. The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall. Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area. Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction. At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed. The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected. The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder. Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved. The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port. A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture. Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator. Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed. The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion. All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain. The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",

A curved incision was made below the belly button. Through this cut, the camera port was placed into the belly cavity while watching the view. After the cavity was inflated with gas, three more ports were added in the upper middle and upper right areas.  \n\nThe upper right area was examined. The patient had many adhesions (sticky connections) of the omentum and colon to the liver, and the gallbladder was clearly inflamed. These were carefully cut with a cautery device to see the gallbladder. The gallbladder was thick, swollen, and most of its front wall was dead. Adhesions between the omentum, colon, and gallbladder were slowly cut from the top down to the cystic duct area.  \n\nOnce all adhesions were removed, a cholangiogram was performed and showed no blockage or swelling of the common bile duct. Because the gallbladder was so necrotic, a drain was decided to be necessary. The cystic duct and cystic artery were clipped and cut. The gallbladder was taken out of its spot on the liver, and bleeding was controlled with cautery. The gallbladder was placed in a bag and removed through the camera port. A Jackson‑Pratt (JP) drain was threaded through the front port and out of a trocar site, then tied to the skin with a 3‑0 nylon suture.  \n\nThe upper right area was washed out thoroughly with suction and irrigation. After this, the extra ports were removed. The belly‑button opening was closed with a figure‑of‑8 stitch using 0 Vicryl. All skin cuts were given local anesthesia with 1/4% plain Marcaine. The skin was closed with 4‑0 Monocryl in a subcuticular stitch.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the surgery well and was sent to recovery in stable condition."
