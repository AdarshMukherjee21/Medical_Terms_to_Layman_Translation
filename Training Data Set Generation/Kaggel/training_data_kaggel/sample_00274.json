  "medical": "EXAM: Nuclear medicine lymphatic scan. REASON FOR EXAM: Left breast cancer. TECHNIQUE: 1.0 mCi of Technetium-99m sulfur colloid was injected within the dermis surrounding the left breast biopsy site at four locations. A 16-hour left anterior oblique imaging was performed with and without shielding of the original injection site. FINDINGS: There are two small foci of increased activity in the left axilla. This is consistent with the sentinel lymph node. No other areas of activity are visualized outside of the injection site and two axillary lymph nodes. IMPRESSION: Technically successful lymph node injection with two areas of increased activity in the left axilla consistent with sentinel lymph node.",

After 16 hours, images were taken from the left front side, both with and without shielding the injection area.  \n\nFINDINGS: Two small spots of higher activity were seen in the left armpit. These spots match the expected location of the sentinel lymph node. No other areas of activity were seen outside the injection site and the two axillary lymph nodes.  \n\nIMPRESSION: The injection and imaging were done correctly, showing two active spots in the left armpit that correspond to the sentinel lymph node."
