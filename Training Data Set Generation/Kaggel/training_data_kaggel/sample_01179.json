  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right wrist laceration with a flexor carpi radialis laceration and palmaris longus laceration 90%, suspected radial artery laceration. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right wrist laceration with a flexor carpi radialis laceration and palmaris longus laceration 90%, suspected radial artery laceration. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Repair flexor carpi radialis. 2. Repair palmaris longus. ANESTHETIC: General. TOURNIQUET TIME: Less than 30 minutes. CLINICAL NOTE: The patient is a 21-year-old who sustained a clean laceration off a teapot last night. She had lacerated her flexor carpi radialis completely and 90% of her palmaris longus. Both were repaired proximal to the carpal tunnel. The postoperative plans are for a dorsal splint and early range of motion passive and active assist. The wrist will be at approximately 30 degrees of flexion. The MPJ is at 30 degrees of flexion, the IP straight. Splinting will be used until the 4-week postoperative point. PROCEDURE: Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. There were 2 transverse lacerations. Through the first laceration, the flexor carpi radialis was completely severed. The proximal end was found with a tendon retriever. The distal end was just beneath the subcutaneous tissue. A primary core stitch was used with a Kessler stitch. This was with 4-0 FiberWire. A second core stitch was placed, again using 4-0 FiberWire. The repair was oversewn with locking, running, 6-0 Prolene stitch. Through the second incision, the palmaris longus was seen to be approximately 90% severed. It was an oblique laceration. It was repaired with a 4-0 FiberWire core stitch and with a Kessler-type stitch. A secure repair was obtained. She was dorsiflexed to 75 degrees of wrist extension without rupture of the repair. The fascia was released proximally and distally to give her more room for excursion of the repair. The tourniquet was dropped, bleeders were cauterized. Closure was routine with interrupted 5-0 nylon. A bulky hand dressing as well as a dorsal splint with the wrist MPJ and IP as noted. The splint was dorsal. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:**  \nThe patient had a cut on the right wrist that completely cut the flexor carpi radialis tendon and cut about 90 % of the palmaris longus tendon. A radial artery injury was also suspected.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:**  \nSame as pre‑operative.\n\n**Procedures performed:**  \n1. Repaired the flexor carpi radialis tendon.  \n2. Repaired the palmaris longus tendon.\n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia.  \n**Tourniquet time:** Less than 30 minutes.\n\n**Clinical note:**  \nA 21‑year‑old woman cut her right wrist on a teapot last night. The cut was clean. The flexor carpi radialis tendon was completely severed and about 90 % of the palmaris longus tendon was cut. Both tendons were repaired just before the carpal tunnel. After surgery she will wear a dorsal splint and start gentle, assisted movements. The wrist will be kept at about 30° of bending. The metacarpophalangeal joint (MPJ) will also be at 30° of bending, while the interphalangeal joint (IP) will stay straight. The splint will stay on until about 4 weeks after surgery.\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nUnder general anesthesia, the right arm was cleaned and covered. Two horizontal cuts were made.  \n- In the first cut, the flexor carpi radialis tendon was completely cut. The upper end was found with a tendon retriever; the lower end was just under the skin. A primary core stitch was made with a Kessler pattern using 4‑0 FiberWire. A second core stitch was added with the same material. The repair was finished with a locking, running stitch of 6‑0 Prolene.  \n- In the second cut, the palmaris longus tendon was about 90 % cut in an angled way. It was repaired with a 4‑0 FiberWire core stitch and a Kessler‑type stitch, giving a strong repair.  \nThe wrist was moved to 75° of extension to test the repair, which held. The surrounding fascia was released to allow more movement. The tourniquet was released and any bleeding was cauterized. The wound was closed with interrupted 5‑0 nylon stitches. A bulky hand dressing and a dorsal splint were applied, keeping the wrist, MPJ, and IP in the positions described. The patient left the operating room in good condition."
