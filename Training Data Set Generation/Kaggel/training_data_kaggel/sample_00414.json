  "medical": "INDICATION: Rectal bleeding. PREMEDICATION: See procedure nurse NCS form. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was placed in the left lateral position. Digital rectal exam was performed revealing normal sphincter tone and no external hemorrhoids. A Pentax video endoscope was then inserted into rectum. The quality of the preparation was good. Under direct visualization, the endoscope was advanced to 60 cm from the anus without difficulty, and then slowly withdrawn, with careful examination of the colonic mucosa. The mucosa was normal with the normal vascular pattern and no granularity, friability, or ulceration. There was no evidence of other polyps, masses, diverticula, or angiodysplasia. Retroflexion was performed in the rectum, and there were a few small white patches just at the anal verge. These were biopsied to rule out any abnormality and also internal hemorrhoids were noted. The colonoscope was then removed and the procedure was terminated. The endoscope was removed and the procedure terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications. IMPRESSION: 1. White plaques at the anal verge, biopsied to rule out abnormality. 2. Internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal flexible sigmoidoscopy. PLAN: Continue fiber supplement as well as hyoscyamine. Await laboratory results. I will see her back in July 2005 when I return from maternity leave. If she has any problems during the interval when I am gone, she will follow up with any other physicians here in the office.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the visit:** bleeding from the rectum.  \n\n**Before the procedure:** Follow the instructions on the nurse’s pre‑procedure form.  \n\n**What was done:**  \nAfter the patient gave permission, she was turned onto her left side. A quick finger test of the rectum showed normal muscle tone and no external hemorrhoids. A video scope (Pentax) was gently inserted into the rectum. The cleaning of the bowel was good. The scope was moved forward 60 cm from the anus without any trouble, then pulled back slowly while the doctor looked closely at the lining of the colon. The lining looked normal, with a regular blood‑vessel pattern and no bumps, sores, or other growths. No extra polyps, masses, holes (diverticula), or abnormal blood vessels were seen. The scope was bent back to look at the rectum again, and a few small white spots were found right at the edge of the anus. These spots were taken a tiny sample from (biopsied) to make sure they were not abnormal. Internal hemorrhoids were also seen. The scope was removed and the procedure was finished. The patient had no problems during the exam.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n1. Small white spots at the edge of the anus – a sample was taken to check for any abnormality.  \n2. Internal hemorrhoids; otherwise the flexible sigmoidoscopy was normal.  \n\n**Plan:** Keep taking a fiber supplement and hyoscyamine. Wait for lab results. I will see her again in July 2005 after my maternity leave. If she has any problems while I’m away, she can see any other doctors in our office."
