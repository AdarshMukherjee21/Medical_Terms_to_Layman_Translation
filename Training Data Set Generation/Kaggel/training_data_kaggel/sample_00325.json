  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Trigger thumb release. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A transverse incision was made over the MPJ crease of the thumb. Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles. The flexor sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release the A1 pulley under direct vision on the radial side, from its proximal extent to its distal extent at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the proximal phalanx. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The flexor pollicis longus tendon was identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained. The patient then actively moved the thumb and no triggering was noted. After irrigating out the wound with copious amounts of sterile saline, the skin was closed with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures. The wound was dressed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "**Procedure: Thumb Trigger Release**\n\n**What was done:**  \nAfter giving the patient the right antibiotics and a local anesthetic (MAC), the arm was cleaned and covered in the usual sterile way. The arm was emptied of blood with an Esmarch bandage and a tourniquet was tightened to 250 mmHg. A horizontal cut was made over the crease where the thumb meets the hand. The surgeon carefully cut down to the flexor sheath, taking care to protect the nerves and blood vessels. The sheath was opened with a scalpel, and a pair of scissors was used to cut the A1 pulley on the thumb’s radial side, from its upper end to the point where the proximal and middle thirds of the thumb bone meet. Blood loss was controlled with a bipolar cautery device. The flexor pollicis longus tendon was gently pulled to make sure the thumb would no longer catch. The patient then moved the thumb on her own and it moved freely. The wound was washed thoroughly with sterile saline, and the skin was closed with 5‑0 nylon stitches. The area was dressed and the patient was taken to recovery in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
