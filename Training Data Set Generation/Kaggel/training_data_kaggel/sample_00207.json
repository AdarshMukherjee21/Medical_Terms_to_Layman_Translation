  "medical": "PROCEDURES: 1. Release of ventral chordee. 2. Circumcision. 3. Repair of partial duplication of urethral meatus. INDICATIONS: The patient is an 11-month-old baby boy who presented for evaluation of a duplicated urethral meatus as well as ventral chordee and dorsal prepuce hooding. He is here electively for surgical correction. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought back into operating room 35. After successful induction of general endotracheal anesthetic, giving the patient, preoperative antibiotics and after completing a preoperative time out, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A holding stitch was placed in the glans penis. At this point, we probed both urethral meatus. Using the Crede maneuver, we could see urine clearly coming out of the lower, the more ventral meatus. At this point, we cannulated this with a 6-French hypospadias catheter. We attempted to cannulate the dorsal opening, however, we were unsuccessful. We then attempted to place lacrimal probes and were also unsuccessful indicating this was incomplete duplication. At this point, we identified the band connecting both the urethral meatus and incised it with tenotomy scissors. We sutured both meatus together such that there was one meatus at the normal position at the tip of the glans. At this point, we made a circumcising incision around the penis and degloved the penis in its entirety relieving all chordee. Once all the chordee had been adequately released, we turned our attention to the circumcision. Excessive dorsal foreskin was removed from the skin and glans. Mucosal cuts were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 chromic suture. Dermabond was placed over this and bacitracin was placed on this once dry. This ended the procedure. DRAINS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. URINE OUTPUT: Unrecorded. COMPLICATIONS: None apparent. DISPOSITION: The patient will now go under the care of Dr. XYZ, Plastic Surgery, for excision of scalp hemangioma.",
  "layman": "**Procedures performed:**  \n1. Fixed the ventral curvature of the penis (ventral chordee).  \n2. Removed the foreskin (circumcision).  \n3. Joined the two openings of the urethra into one normal opening.\n\n**Why the surgery was done:**  \nAn 11‑month‑old baby boy was brought in because he had a duplicated urethral opening, a curved penis, and extra skin on the back of the foreskin. He was scheduled for elective surgery to correct these problems.\n\n**What happened during the operation:**  \nThe baby was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia through a breathing tube. He received antibiotics before the surgery. After a safety check, the surgical area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A stitch was placed in the tip of the penis to hold it in place.\n\nBoth urethral openings were examined. By gently pressing the penis (Crede maneuver), urine was seen coming out of the lower, ventral opening. A 6‑French catheter was inserted into this opening. Attempts to insert a catheter or a small probe into the upper, dorsal opening failed, showing that the duplication was incomplete.\n\nA small band of tissue connecting the two openings was cut with scissors. The two openings were then sewn together so that there was one normal opening at the tip of the penis. A circular incision was made around the penis to remove the foreskin, which also released the curvature. The extra skin on the back of the foreskin was removed. The cut edges of the skin and mucous membrane were stitched together with 5‑0 chromic sutures. A skin adhesive (Dermabond) was applied, and a thin layer of antibiotic ointment (bacitracin) was added once the adhesive dried. The surgery was finished.\n\n**After the operation:**  \n- No drains were placed.  \n- Blood loss was minimal.  \n- Urine output was not recorded.  \n- No complications were noted.\n\n**Next steps:**  \nThe baby will be taken care of by Dr. XYZ in Plastic Surgery for removal of a scalp birthmark (hemangioma)."
