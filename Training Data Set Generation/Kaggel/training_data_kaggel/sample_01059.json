  "medical": "INDICATION: Rectal bleeding, constipation, abnormal CT scan, rule out inflammatory bowel disease. PREMEDICATION: See procedure nurse NCS form. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral position and the above medications were titrated with adequate sedation. Monitoring was provided throughout the entire procedure. Digital rectal exam was performed revealing normal sphincter tone and no external hemorrhoids. The Pentax video colonoscope was inserted into rectum and advanced under direct visualization, without difficulty, to the cecum, where the cecal strap, appendiceal orifice, and the ileocecal valve were identified. The quality of the preparation was good. The colonoscope was then withdrawn while carefully examining the mucosa. The colonic mucosa appeared normal with normal vascularity and haustral markings. No masses, polyps, AVM/s or diverticula were seen. On retroflexed view in the rectum, there are small internal hemorrhoids. The endoscope was removed and the procedure terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications. IMPRESSION: 1. Small internal hemorrhoids. 2. Otherwise normal colonoscopy. PLAN: Continue fiber, increase to two tablets twice a day for a total of four tablets. Also try NuLev. FOLLOWUP: In the office in approximately four weeks if her symptoms do not resolve.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam:** The patient had rectal bleeding, constipation, an abnormal CT scan, and we wanted to rule out inflammatory bowel disease.  \n\n**Before the exam:** The nurse checked the pre‑medication form.  \n\n**What was done:** After the patient gave consent, she was put on her left side and given the right amount of sedative medication. We watched her the whole time. A digital rectal exam showed normal muscle tone and no external hemorrhoids. A Pentax video colonoscope was gently inserted into the rectum and moved forward until it reached the cecum, where we saw the cecal strap, the opening of the appendix, and the ileocecal valve. The bowel prep was good. While pulling the scope back, we looked carefully at the lining of the colon. It looked normal with regular blood vessel patterns and folds. No lumps, polyps, abnormal vessels, or diverticula were found. When we looked back into the rectum, we saw small internal hemorrhoids. The scope was removed and the exam was finished. The patient had no problems.  \n\n**Findings:** 1. Small internal hemorrhoids. 2. The rest of the colon looked normal.  \n\n**Plan:** Keep taking fiber supplements and take two tablets twice a day (four tablets total). Also try NuLev.  \n\n**Follow‑up:** Come back to the office in about four weeks if symptoms are still present."
