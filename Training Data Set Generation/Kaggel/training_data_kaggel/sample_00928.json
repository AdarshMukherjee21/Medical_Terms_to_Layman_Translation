  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Cardiac arrhythmia. INTERPRETATION: No significant pericardial effusion was identified. The aortic root dimensions are within normal limits. The four cardiac chambers dimensions are within normal limits. No discrete regional wall motion abnormalities are identified. The left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%. The left ventricular wall thickness is within normal limits. The aortic valve is trileaflet with adequate excursion of the leaflets. The mitral valve and tricuspid valve motion is unremarkable. The pulmonic valve is not well visualized. Color flow and conventional Doppler interrogation of cardiac valvular structures revealed mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation with an RV systolic pressure calculated to be 28 mmHg. Doppler interrogation of the mitral in-flow pattern is within normal limits for age. IMPRESSION: 1. Preserved left ventricular systolic function. 2. Mild mitral regurgitation. 3. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam:**  \nHeart rhythm problem.\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nNo fluid around the heart.  \nThe aortic root and all four heart chambers are the right size.  \nThe heart muscle moves normally in all areas.  \nThe left ventricle is working well, pumping about 60% of the blood it holds.  \nThe left ventricle wall thickness is normal.  \nThe aortic valve has three leaflets that move properly.  \nThe mitral and tricuspid valves move normally.  \nThe pulmonic valve isn’t clearly seen.  \nA color flow test shows a little leaking (regurgitation) from the mitral valve and a little leaking from the tricuspid valve.  \nThe right ventricle’s pressure is 28 mmHg.  \nThe flow pattern into the mitral valve is normal for your age.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Left ventricle is functioning normally.  \n2. Mild leaking of the mitral valve.  \n3. Mild leaking of the tricuspid valve."
