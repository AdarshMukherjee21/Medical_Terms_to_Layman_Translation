  "medical": "CC: HA and vision loss. HX: 71 y/o RHM developed a cataclysmic headache on 11/5/92 associated with a violent sneeze. The headache lasted 3-4 days. On 11/7/92, he had acute pain and loss of vision in the left eye. Over the following day his left pupil enlarged and his left upper eyelid began to droop. He was seen locally and a brain CT showed no sign of bleeding, but a tortuous left middle cerebral artery was visualized. The patient was transferred to UIHC 11/12/92. FHX: HTN, stroke, coronary artery disease, melanoma. SHX: Quit smoking 15 years ago. MEDS: Lanoxin, Capoten, Lasix, KCL, ASA, Voltaren, Alupent MDI PMH: CHF, Atrial Fibrillation, Obesity, Anemia, Duodenal Ulcer, Spinal AVM resection 1986 with residual T9 sensory level, hyperreflexia and bilateral babinski signs, COPD. EXAM: 35.5C, BP 140/91, P86, RR20. Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. CN: No light perception OS, Pupils: 3/7 decreasing to 2/7 on exposure to light (i.e., fixed/dilated pupil OS). Upon neutral gaze the left eye deviated laterally and inferiorly. There was complete ptosis OS. On downward gaze their was intorsion OS. The left eye could not move superiorly, medially or effectively downward, but could move laterally. EOM were full OD. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor, Coordination, Station and Gait testing were unremarkable. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick and light touch below T9 (old). Muscle stretch reflexes were increased (3+/3+) in both lower extremities and there were bilateral babinski signs (old). The upper extremity reflexes were symmetrical (2/2). Cardiovascular exam revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm and lung sounds were coarse bilaterally. The rest of the general exam was unremarkable. LAB: CBC, PT/PTT, General Screen were unremarkable except for a BUN 21mg/DL. CSF: protein 88mg/DL, glucose 58mg/DL, RBC 2800/mm3, WBC 1/mm3. ANA, RF, TSH, FT4 were WNL. IMPRESSION: CN3 palsy and loss of vision. Differential diagnosis: temporal arteritis, aneurysm, intracranial mass. COURSE: The outside Brain CT revealed a tortuous left MCA. A four-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed a dolichoectatic basilar artery and tortuous LICA. There was no evidence of aneursym. Transesophageal Echocardiogram revealed atrial enlargement only. Neuroopthalmologic evaluation revealed: Loss of color vision and visual acuity OS, RAPD OS, bilateral optic disk pallor (OS &gt; OD), CN3 palsy and bilateral temporal field loss, OS &gt;&gt; OD . ESR, CRP, MRI were recommended to rule out temporal arteritis and intracranial mass. ESR 29mm/Hr, CRP 4.3mg/DL (high) , The patient was placed on prednisone. Temporal artery biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. MRI scan could not be obtained due to patient weight. Sellar CT was done instead: coronal sections revealed sellar enlargement and upward bowing of the diaphragm sella suggesting a pituitary mass. In retrospect sellar enlargement could be seen on the angiogram X-rays. Differential consideration was given to cystic pituitary adenoma, noncalcified craniopharyngioma, or Rathke's cleft cyst with solid component. The patient refused surgery. He was seen in Neuroopthalmology Clinic 2/18/93 and was found to have mild recovery of vision OS and improved visual fields. Aberrant reinnervation of the 3rd nerve was noted as there was constriction of the pupil (OS) on adduction, downgaze and upgaze. The upper eyelid, OS, elevated on adduction and down gaze, OS. EOM movements were otherwise full and there was no evidence of ptosis. In retrospect he was felt to have suffered pituitary apoplexy in 11/92.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Headache and vision loss.  \n\n**History of present illness:**  \nA 71‑year‑old man with a history of heart failure and other conditions had a sudden, severe headache on November 5, 1992 after a violent sneeze. The headache lasted 3–4 days. On November 7 he suddenly felt pain and lost vision in his left eye. The next day his left pupil became very large and his left upper eyelid began to droop. He was first seen at a local hospital where a brain CT scan showed no bleeding but a twisted left middle cerebral artery. He was transferred to UIHC on November 12.\n\n**Family history:** Hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, melanoma.  \n\n**Social history:** Quit smoking 15 years ago.  \n\n**Medications:** Lanoxin, Capoten, Lasix, potassium chloride, aspirin, Voltaren, Alupent (inhaler).  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n- Congestive heart failure  \n- Atrial fibrillation  \n- Obesity  \n- Anemia  \n- Duodenal ulcer  \n- Spinal arteriovenous malformation removed in 1986 (still has a sensory level at T9, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski signs)  \n- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  \n\n**Physical exam (at UIHC):**  \n- Temperature 35.5 °C, blood pressure 140/91 mm Hg, pulse 86, respirations 20.  \n- Alert and oriented.  \n- Left eye: no light perception. Pupil 3 mm in darkness, 2 mm when light is shone (fixed and dilated). The eye turns outward and downward when looking straight. The left eyelid is fully drooped. The eye can’t move up, in, or down, but can move sideways.  \n- Right eye: normal eye movements.  \n- Other cranial nerves normal.  \n- Motor, coordination, stance, and gait normal.  \n- Sensation decreased below T9 (old finding).  \n- Reflexes: lower‑extremity reflexes 3+/3+ (high) with bilateral Babinski signs (old). Upper‑extremity reflexes 2/2.  \n- Heart rhythm irregular. Lungs coarse on both sides.  \n\n**Laboratory tests:**  \n- CBC, PT/PTT, general screen normal except BUN 21 mg/dL.  \n- CSF: protein 88 mg/dL, glucose 58 mg/dL, 2800 red cells/mm³, 1 white cell/mm³.  \n- ANA, RF, TSH, FT4 normal.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- Third‑nerve palsy (CN III) and loss of vision.  \n- Possible causes: temporal arteritis, aneurysm, or brain tumor.  \n\n**Course of care:**  \n- The outside CT showed a twisted left middle cerebral artery.  \n- A four‑vessel cerebral angiogram revealed a stretched basilar artery and twisted left internal carotid artery; no aneurysm seen.  \n- Transesophageal echo showed only enlarged atrium.  \n- Neuro‑ophthalmology exam: loss of color vision and visual acuity in the left eye, relative afferent pupillary defect, pale optic discs (more on left than right), third‑nerve palsy, and loss of vision in the outer part of the visual field (left eye much worse than right).  \n- ESR 29 mm/hr, CRP 4.3 mg/dL (high). Prednisone was started.  \n- Temporal artery biopsy showed no inflammation.  \n- MRI could not be done because the patient was too heavy; a sellar CT was performed instead. It showed an enlarged pituitary region and an upward‑bowed diaphragm sella, suggesting a pituitary tumor. The angiogram X‑rays also hinted at this enlargement.  \n- Possible diagnoses: cystic pituitary adenoma, non‑calcified craniopharyngioma, or Rathke’s cleft cyst with a solid part.  \n- The patient declined surgery.  \n- At a neuro‑ophthalmology follow‑up on February 18, 1993, he had slight improvement in left‑eye vision and visual fields. The pupil on the left became slightly smaller when the eye moved inward, downward, or upward, indicating some nerve recovery. The left eyelid no longer drooped and eye movements were normal.  \n- In hindsight, the events in November 1992 were likely due to pituitary apoplexy (bleeding or swelling in the pituitary gland)."
