PROCEDURE: Insertion of a triple-lumen central line through the right subclavian vein by the percutaneous technique. PROCEDURE DETAIL: This lady has a bowel obstruction. She was being fed through a central line, which as per the patient was just put yesterday and this slipped out. At the patient's bedside after obtaining an informed consent, the patient's right deltopectoral area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated and with the patient in Trendelenburg position, she had her right subclavian vein percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty. A Seldinger technique was used and a triple-lumen catheter was inserted. There was a good flow through all three ports, which were irrigated with saline prior to connection to the IV solutions. The catheter was affixed to the skin with sutures and then a dressing was applied. The postprocedure chest x-ray revealed that there were no complications to the procedure and that the catheter was in good place.",

Central line fell out.  \n\nPROCEDURE  \nA triple‑lumen central line was inserted into the right subclavian vein using a percutaneous method.  \n\nPROCEDURE DETAIL  \nThe patient had a bowel blockage and was receiving nutrition through a central line that had been placed the day before but had come out. After getting informed consent, the area on the right side of her chest where the line would be placed was cleaned and covered. Xylocaine 1% was injected to numb the area. With the patient lying slightly head‑down (Trendelenburg position), the right subclavian vein was punctured and a guidewire was passed (Seldinger technique). A triple‑lumen catheter was then threaded over the wire into the vein. All three ports filled well with fluid, and each was flushed with saline before connecting to IV solutions. The catheter was secured to the skin with sutures and covered with a dressing. A chest X‑ray taken after the procedure showed the catheter was in the correct position and there were no complications."
