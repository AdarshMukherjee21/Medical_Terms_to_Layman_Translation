  "medical": "REASON FOR VISIT: The patient referred by Dr. X for evaluation of her possible tethered cord. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, she is a 14-year-old right handed female who is in 9th grade, who underwent a lipomyomeningocele repair at 3 days of age and then again at 3-1/2 years of age. The last surgery was in 03/95. She did well; however, in the past several months has had some leg pain in both legs out laterally, worsening at night and requiring Advil, Motrin as well as Tylenol PM. Denies any new bowel or bladder dysfunction or increased sensory loss. She had some patchy sensory loss from L4 to S1. MEDICATIONS: Singulair for occasional asthma. FINDINGS: She is awake, alert, and oriented x 3. Pupils equal and reactive. EOMs are full. Motor is 5 out of 5. She was able to toe and heel walk without any difficulties as well as tendon reflexes were 2 plus. There is no evidence of clonus. There is diminished sensation from L4 to S1, having proprioception. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Possible tethered cord. I had a thorough discussion with the patient and her parents. I have recommended a repeat MRI scan. The prescription was given today. MRI of the lumbar spine was just completed. I would like to see her back in clinic. We did discuss the possible symptoms of this tethering.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:**  \nThe patient was sent by Dr. X to check if she might have a tethered spinal cord.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nShe is a 14‑year‑old right‑handed girl in 9th grade. She had a lipomyomeningocele (a type of spinal cord and skin growth) removed when she was 3 days old and again when she was 3½ years old. Her last surgery was in March 1995. She has been doing well, but in the past few months she has had pain in both legs, especially on the outer sides, that gets worse at night. She has been taking Advil (Motrin) and Tylenol PM for relief. She does not have any new problems with her bowel or bladder, and her feeling of pain or touch has not gotten worse. She does have some patchy loss of sensation from the L4 to S1 area of her lower back and legs.\n\n**Medications:**  \nSingulair for occasional asthma.\n\n**Findings:**  \nShe is awake, alert, and knows her name, age, and location. Her pupils are equal and react normally. Eye movements are normal. Muscle strength is normal (5/5). She can walk on her toes and heels without trouble. Reflexes are normal (2+). There is no clonus (rapid involuntary muscle contractions). She has reduced sensation from L4 to S1, but she can still feel position (proprioception).\n\n**Assessment and plan:**  \nThe doctor thinks she may have a tethered cord. She talked with the patient and her parents about this possibility. The doctor has ordered a repeat MRI of the lumbar spine and gave the prescription today. The MRI was just finished. The doctor wants to see her again in clinic. They also discussed what symptoms might come from a tethered cord."
