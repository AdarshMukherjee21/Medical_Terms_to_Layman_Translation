  "medical": "PROCEDURE:: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An #11 blade scalpel was used to make a small infraumbilical skin incision in the midline. The fascia was elevated between two Ochsner clamps and then incised. A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges. The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen. A pneumoperitoneum was established. After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted. Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision. An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area. Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant. The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left. The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally. The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally. Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder. The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up. The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder. The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot. After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder. The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally. Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided. An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained. This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct. There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects. The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized. The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct. The cystic duct was then divided using scissors. The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery. The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site. The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned. All dissection areas were inspected. They were hemostatic. There was not any bile leakage. All clips were in place. The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry. All ports were then removed under direct vision. The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate. The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl. The fascia at the umbilical port was closed by tying the previously placed stitch. All skin incisions were then closed with subcuticular sutures of 4-0 Monocryl and 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was infiltrated into all port sites. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient is currently being aroused from general endotracheal anesthesia. I was present during the entire case.",
  "layman": "After the patient gave permission, she was taken to the operating room and laid on her back on the table. She was put under general anesthesia through a breathing tube. The surgeon cleaned and covered her with sterile drapes. A small cut was made below the belly button with a #11 scalpel. The muscle layer was lifted with clamps and cut. A figure‑of‑eight stitch was tied in the muscle edges. A 11‑mm surgical port was then inserted into the belly, and air was pumped in to create space (pneumoperitoneum). Once the space was ready, a camera was put in. Three more ports were added while watching the camera: one 11‑mm port in the upper middle belly and two 5‑mm ports on the right side. The patient was tilted slightly upward and turned to the left. The top of the gallbladder was pulled up and to the side, and the lower part was pulled down and to the side. The surgeon used a small electric knife to carefully cut the tissue around the base of the gallbladder. The triangle of Calot (the area where important vessels are) was opened. The cystic duct and cystic artery were found. A clip was placed high on the cystic duct near where it meets the gallbladder. The cystic artery was clipped twice near the top and once near the bottom. Scissors were used to cut a small opening in the cystic duct and to cut the artery. A dye test (cholangiogram) was done while the patient was still in surgery. It showed that bile flowed normally from the cystic duct into the common bile duct and then into the small intestine, with no blockages. The bile ducts were clearly seen. The dye tube was removed, and two more clips were placed on the cystic duct below the cut. The cystic duct was then cut with scissors. The gallbladder was removed from the liver using the electric knife and taken out through the upper middle port. The area where the gallbladder was attached to the liver was washed and suctioned. All cut areas were checked and were not bleeding. No bile leaked. All clips were secure. The space above the liver was also washed and suctioned until dry. All ports were taken out while watching the camera. The belly cavity was let out of air. The muscle layer at the upper middle port was closed with a stitch. The muscle layer at the belly button port was closed by tying the earlier stitch. All skin cuts were closed with fine stitches (4‑0 Monocryl). A local anesthetic with epinephrine (0.25%) was injected into all port sites. The patient tolerated the surgery well and is now waking up from anesthesia. I was present for the whole operation."
