Peripheral vascular disease. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Bilateral carotid cerebral angiogram. 2. Right femoral-popliteal angiogram. FINDINGS: The right carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The right internal carotid artery was found to be very tortuous with kinking in its cervical portions, but no focal stenosis was noted. Likewise, the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the right middle cerebral artery. The left carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery showed a 30 to 40% stenosis with small ulcer crater present. The intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the left middle cerebral artery. Visualization of the right lower extremity showed no significant disease. PROCEDURE: With the patient in supine position under local anesthesia plus intravenous sedation, the groin areas were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The common femoral artery was punctured in a routine retrograde fashion and a 5-French introducer sheath was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. A catheter was then placed in the aortic arch and the right and left common carotid arteries were then selectively catheterized and visualized as described above. Following completion of the above, the catheter and introducer sheath were removed. Heparin had been initially given, which was reversed with protamine. Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes, followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and sandbag compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout.",

Blood vessel disease in the limbs.  \n\nOPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Imaging of both carotid arteries. 2. Imaging of the right thigh and knee blood vessels.  \n\nFINDINGS: The right carotid artery was examined with a catheter. It was very twisted and kinked in the neck, but there was no narrowing. The part of the artery inside the skull also had no major problems, and the right middle cerebral artery was normal.  \nThe left carotid artery was also examined. The neck part of the left internal carotid artery had a 30‑40% narrowing and a small ulcer. The inside‑skull part of the left artery and the left middle cerebral artery were normal.  \nImaging of the right leg showed no major problems.  \n\nPROCEDURE: The patient lay on their back. Local anesthesia and IV sedation were used. The groin area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The common femoral artery was punctured in a standard way and a 5‑French introducer sheath was placed under X‑ray guidance. A catheter was then guided into the aortic arch and into the right and left common carotid arteries, and the imaging described above was done. After the imaging, the catheter and sheath were removed. Heparin was given at the start and then reversed with protamine. Pressure was applied to the puncture site for 20 minutes, then a sterile Coverlet dressing and a sandbag were used for compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
