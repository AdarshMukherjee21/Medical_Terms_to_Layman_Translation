Alkaline reflux gastritis. 4. Gastroparesis. 5. Probable Billroth II anastomosis. 6. Status post Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 55-year-old African-American female who had undergone Whipple's procedure approximately five to six years ago for a benign pancreatic mass. The patient has pancreatic insufficiency and is already on replacement. She is currently using Nexium. She has continued postprandial dyspepsia and reflux symptoms. To evaluate this, the patient was boarded for EGD. The patient gave informed consent for the procedure. GROSS FINDINGS: At the time of EGD, the patient was found to have alkaline reflux gastritis. There was no evidence of distal esophagitis. Gastroparesis was seen as there was retained fluid in the small intestine. The patient had no evidence of anastomotic obstruction and appeared to have a Billroth II reconstruction by gastric jejunostomy. Biopsies were taken and further recommendations will follow. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite. The heart and lungs examination were unremarkable. The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure. The patient's oropharynx was anesthetized with Cetacaine spray. She was placed in left lateral position. The patient had the video Olympus GIF gastroscope model inserted per os and was advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx. GE junction was in normal position. There was no evidence of any hiatal hernia. There was no evidence of distal esophagitis. The gastric remnant was entered. It was noted to be inflamed with alkaline reflux gastritis. The anastomosis was open and patent. The small intestine was entered. There was retained fluid material in the stomach and small intestine and _______ gastroparesis. Biopsies were performed. Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope. The patient's diet will be adjusted to postgastrectomy-type diet. Biopsies performed. Diet will be reviewed. The patient will have an upper GI series performed to rule out more distal type obstruction explaining the retained fluid versus gastroparesis. Reglan will also be added. Further recommendations will follow.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Acid reflux (GERD). 2. Chronic indigestion.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Acid reflux (GERD). 2. Chronic indigestion. 3. Alkaline reflux gastritis. 4. Gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying). 5. Likely Billroth II anastomosis (type of stomach‑small intestine connection). 6. After a Whipple surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy).  \n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum with tissue samples taken.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 55‑year‑old African‑American woman had a Whipple surgery about five to six years ago for a non‑cancerous pancreatic tumor. She now has pancreatic insufficiency and takes replacement enzymes. She also takes Nexium for acid reflux. She continues to have stomach pain after meals and reflux symptoms, so an endoscopy was scheduled. She gave informed consent.  \n\nGROSS FINDINGS: During the endoscopy the doctor saw alkaline reflux gastritis. There was no inflammation of the lower esophagus. The stomach and small intestine had fluid that had not moved, indicating gastroparesis. There was no blockage at the surgical connection, which appears to be a Billroth II reconstruction (stomach connected to the jejunum). Tissue samples were taken; further recommendations will be given.  \n\nPROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the endoscopy room. Her heart and lungs were normal. Vital signs stayed stable during the procedure. Her throat was numbed with Cetacaine spray. She was positioned on her left side. A video scope (Olympus GIF) was inserted through her mouth and passed easily through the throat. The gastroesophageal junction was in a normal place, with no hiatal hernia or esophageal inflammation. The remaining stomach was entered and found inflamed with alkaline reflux gastritis. The surgical connection was open and clear. The small intestine was entered and fluid was seen in the stomach and small intestine, consistent with gastroparesis. Tissue samples were taken. Air was released as the scope was withdrawn. The patient will be advised to follow a post‑gastrectomy diet. She will have an upper GI series (X‑ray study) to check for any blockage further down that might explain the fluid retention versus gastroparesis. Reglan (metoclopramide) will also be added. Further recommendations will follow."
