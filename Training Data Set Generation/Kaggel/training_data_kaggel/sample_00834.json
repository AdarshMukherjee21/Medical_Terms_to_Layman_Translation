  "medical": "PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Phenol neurolysis left musculocutaneous nerve and bilateral obturator nerves. Botulinum toxin injection left pectoralis major, left wrist flexors, and bilateral knee extensors. PROCEDURE CODES: 64640 times three, 64614 times four, 95873 times four. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic quadriparesis secondary to traumatic brain injury, 907.0. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic quadriparesis secondary to traumatic brain injury, 907.0. ANESTHESIA: MAC. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient's brother. The patient was brought to the minor procedure area and sedated per their protocol. The patient was positioned lying supine. Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine. The obturator nerves were identified lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse using active EMG stimulation. Approximately 7 mL was injected on the right side and 5 mL on the left side. At all sites of phenol injections in this area injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus. Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol. The musculocutaneous nerve was identified in the left upper extremity above the brachial pulse using active EMG stimulation. Approximately 5 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location. Injections in this area were done at the site of maximum elbow flexion contraction with least amount of stimulus. Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol. Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified using active EMG stimulation. Approximately 150 units was injected in the knee extensors bilaterally, 100 units in the left pectoralis major, and 50 units in the left wrist flexors. Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 450 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.",
  "layman": "**What was done:**  \nThe doctor used phenol to numb the left musculocutaneous nerve and both obturator nerves. Botulinum toxin (Botox) was injected into the left pectoralis major muscle, the left wrist flexor muscles, and the knee extensor muscles on both legs.  \n\n**Procedure codes used:** 64640 (three times), 64614 (four times), 95873 (four times).  \n\n**Before the procedure:** The patient had spastic quadriparesis (stiffness in all four limbs) caused by a traumatic brain injury (ICD‑10 code 907.0).  \n\n**After the procedure:** The same diagnosis was recorded.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** The patient received monitored anesthesia care (MAC).  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**How the procedure was done:**  \n1. The patient’s brother gave permission.  \n2. The patient was taken to a small procedure room and sedated according to the hospital’s protocol.  \n3. The patient lay on their back.  \n4. The skin where injections would be made was cleaned with chlorhexidine.  \n5. The obturator nerves were located on the side of the thigh, just below the femoral pulse, using EMG stimulation. About 7 mL of phenol was injected on the right side and 5 mL on the left.  \n6. Phenol was injected at the spot where the hip adductor muscles contracted most strongly and with the lowest EMG stimulus. Blood was withdrawn before each phenol injection.  \n7. The left upper arm’s musculocutaneous nerve was found above the brachial pulse with EMG. About 5 mL of 5 % phenol was injected there, again at the point of maximum elbow flexion with the lowest stimulus, and blood was withdrawn first.  \n8. The muscles receiving Botox were also located with EMG.  \n   * 150 units were injected into the knee extensors on both legs.  \n   * 100 units into the left pectoralis major.  \n   * 50 units into the left wrist flexors.  \n   The total Botox dose was 450 units, diluted to 25 units per milliliter.  \n9. The patient tolerated everything well and no problems occurred."
