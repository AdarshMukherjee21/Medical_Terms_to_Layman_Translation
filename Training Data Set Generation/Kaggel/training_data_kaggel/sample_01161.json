  "medical": "INTERPRETATION: MRI of the cervical spine without contrast showed normal vertebral body height and alignment with normal cervical cord signal. At C4-C5, there were minimal uncovertebral osteophytes with mild associated right foraminal compromise. At C5-C6, there were minimal diffuse disc bulge and uncovertebral osteophytes with indentation of the anterior thecal sac, but no cord deformity or foraminal compromise. At C6-C7, there was a central disc herniation resulting in mild deformity of the anterior aspect of the cord with patent neuroforamina. MRI of the thoracic spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There was evidence of disc generation, especially anteriorly at the T5-T6 level. There was no significant central canal or foraminal compromise. Thoracic cord normal in signal morphology. MRI of the lumbar spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There is disc desiccation at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis at L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4. There was a right paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 narrowing of the right lateral recess. The transversing nerve root on the right was impinged at that level. The right foramen was mildly compromised. There was also a central disc protrusion seen at the L5-S1 level resulting in indentation of the anterior thecal sac and minimal bilateral foraminal compromise. IMPRESSION: Overall impression was mild degenerative changes present in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine without high-grade central canal or foraminal narrowing. There was narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 level and associated impingement of the transversing nerve root at that level by a disc protrusion. This was also seen on a prior study.",
  "layman": "MRI of the neck (cervical spine) shows normal bone height and alignment, and the spinal cord looks normal.  \nAt the C4‑C5 level there are small bone spurs and a slight narrowing of the right side opening.  \nAt C5‑C6 there is a small disc bulge and bone spurs that press a little on the front of the spinal cord, but the cord is not deformed and the openings are clear.  \nAt C6‑C7 there is a central disc herniation that slightly deforms the front of the cord, yet the nerve openings remain open.\n\nMRI of the chest (thoracic spine) shows normal bone height and alignment.  \nThere is disc degeneration, especially at T5‑T6, but no significant narrowing of the central canal or side openings.  \nThe thoracic cord looks normal.\n\nMRI of the lower back (lumbar spine) shows normal bone height and alignment.  \nDisc dehydration is seen at L4‑L5 and L5‑S1, but no major narrowing of the central canal or side openings at L1‑L2, L2‑L3, or L3‑L4.  \nAt L4‑L5 there is a right‑sided disc bulge that narrows the right side opening and presses on the right nerve root; the right opening is slightly narrowed.  \nAt L5‑S1 there is a central disc bulge that presses on the front of the spinal cord and slightly narrows both side openings.\n\nOverall, mild wear‑and‑tear changes are present in the neck, chest, and lower back, but no severe narrowing.  \nThe right side opening at L4‑L5 is narrowed and the right nerve root is pressed by the disc bulge, a finding that was also seen on a previous scan."
