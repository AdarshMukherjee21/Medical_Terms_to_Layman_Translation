  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left testicular torsion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left testicular torsion. 2. Left testicular abscess. 3. Necrotic testes. SURGERY: Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy. DRAINS: Penrose drain on the left hemiscrotum. The patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin preop. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 49-year-old male who came into the emergency room with 2-week history of left testicular pain, scrotal swelling, elevated white count of 39,000. The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain. Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle. Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed. Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis. The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed. The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made. There was very, very thick scrotal skin. There was no necrotic skin. As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum. The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus. The pus just poured out of the left testicle. The left testicle was completely removed. Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue. Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum. There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement. A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum. I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal. So, the right hemiscrotum was opened. The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick. The testicle appeared normal. There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum. At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion. The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress. There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy. Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run. The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition.",

Dead tissue in the testicle.  \n\nSURGERY: The left testicle was removed (orchiectomy). The scrotum was explored. The right testicle was fixed in place (orchidopexy).  \nDRAINS: A Penrose drain was left in the left side of the scrotum.  \nMEDICATIONS: The patient received vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin before surgery.  \n\nBRIEF HISTORY: A 49‑year‑old man went to the emergency room because his left testicle had been hurting for two weeks, the scrotum was swollen, and his white blood cell count was 39,000. Ultrasound showed that the left testicle was dead. The doctors explained that waiting might not help and that removing the testicle was necessary because of the infection and the risk of serious complications. They discussed the risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, heart attack, blood clots, and other problems. The patient understood the risks and chose to have the surgery.  \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and given anesthesia. The area was cleaned and covered in a sterile way. A midline cut was made in the scrotum. The scrotal skin was thick but not dead. When the left side of the scrotum was opened, a large amount of pus came out. The left testicle was full of pus and had collapsed. The pus poured out of the testicle. The entire left testicle was removed. The surgeon cleaned the scrotal wall to remove any dead tissue. More than 2 liters of antibiotic solution was used to wash the left side of the scrotum. After cleaning, healthy tissue remained. A Penrose drain was placed at the bottom of the left scrotum.  \n\nBecause the left testicle had twisted and become dead, the surgeon also checked the right side. The right scrotum was opened. The right testicle was swollen and the scrotal wall was thick, but the testicle itself looked normal and no pus was found. The surgeon decided to stitch the right testicle in three places with 4‑0 Prolene to prevent future twisting. The right scrotum was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl stitches and the skin was closed with 2‑0 PDS horizontal mattress stitches. Only a small amount of pus was left, and the skin looked healthy. The surgeon closed everything to help the patient heal better.  \n\nAfter the operation, the patient was taken to recovery and was stable."
