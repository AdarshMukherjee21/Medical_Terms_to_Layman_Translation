  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency thermocoagulation of bilateral lumbar sympathetic chain. ANESTHESIA: Local sedation. VITAL SIGNS: See nurse's notes. COMPLICATIONS: None. DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: INT was placed. The patient was in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The patient was given sedation and monitored. Lidocaine 1.5% for skin wheal was made 10 cm from the midline to the bilateral L2 distal vertebral body. A 20-gauge, 15 cm SMK needle was then directed using AP and fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip of the needle was noted to be along the distal one-third and anterior border on the lateral view and on the AP view the tip of the needle was inside the lateral third of the border of the vertebral body. At this time a negative motor stimulation was obtained. Injection of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plus 10 mg of Depo-Medrol was performed. Coagulation was then carried out for 90oC for 90 seconds. At the conclusion of this, the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was withdrawn approximately 5 mm where again a negative motor stimulation was obtained and the sequence of injection and coagulation was repeated. This was repeated one more time with a 5 mm withdrawal and coagulation. At that time, attention was directed to the L3 body where the needle was placed to the upper one-third/distal two-thirds junction and the sequence of injection, coagulation, and negative motor stimulation with needle withdrawal one time of a 5 mm distance was repeated. There were no compilations from this. The patient was discharged to operating room recovery in stable condition.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Radiofrequency heat treatment of both lumbar sympathetic nerves.  \n**Anesthesia:** Local sedation.  \n**Vital signs:** See nurse’s notes.  \n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient was placed on the operating table lying face‑down (prone) and the back was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Sedation was given and the patient was monitored. A 1.5% lidocaine skin test was made 10 cm from the middle of the back to the lower part of the L2 vertebra.  \n\nA 20‑gauge, 15 cm needle was guided into the correct spot using X‑ray (fluoroscopy) in front‑back and side views. The needle tip was positioned in the lower third of the vertebral body and the front edge on the side view, and in the outer third of the vertebral body on the front view. A test was done to make sure the needle was not touching nerves that control movement (negative motor stimulation).  \n\nThen 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine (a local anesthetic) plus 10 mg of Depo‑Medrol (a steroid) was injected. The needle was then heated to 90 °C for 90 seconds to create a small, controlled burn (coagulation). After this, the needle was pulled back about 5 mm, tested again for nerve contact, and the injection and heating were repeated. This was done a third time with another 5 mm pullback.  \n\nNext, the needle was moved to the L3 vertebra, positioned at the upper one‑third to lower two‑thirds junction. The same cycle of injection, heating, and 5 mm pullback was repeated once more.  \n\nNo complications occurred. The patient was sent to the recovery area in stable condition."
