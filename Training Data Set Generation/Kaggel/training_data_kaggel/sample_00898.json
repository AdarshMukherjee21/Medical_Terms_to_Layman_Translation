  "medical": "Sample Doctor, M.D. Sample Address RE: Sample Patient Wife's name: Sample Name Dear Sample Doctor: Mr. Sample Patient was seen on Month DD, YYYY, describing a vasectomy 10 years ago and a failed vasectomy reversal done almost two years ago at the University of Michigan. He has remained azoospermic postoperatively. The operative note suggests the presence of some sperm and sperm head on the right side at the time of the vasectomy reversal. He states that he is interested in sperm harvesting and cryopreservation prior to the next attempted ovulation induction for his wife. Apparently, several attempts at induction have been tried and due to some anatomic abnormality, they have been unsuccessful. At the time that he left the office, he was asking for cryopreservation. At the time of sperm harvesting, I recently received a phone call suggesting that he does not want to do this at all unless his wife's ovulation has been confirmed and it appears then that he may be interested in a fresh specimen harvest. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the actual plan so that we can arrange our procedure appropriately. At his initial request, Month DD, YYYY was picked as the date for scheduled harvesting, although this may change if you require fresh specimen. Thank you very much for the opportunity to have seen him. Sample Doctor, M.D.",

He has had a vasectomy 10 years ago and a failed vasectomy reversal at the University of Michigan almost two years ago. After the surgery he has had no sperm in his semen. The surgery notes say that some sperm and sperm heads were found on the right side during the reversal. He wants to have sperm collected and frozen before his wife tries to get pregnant again. He has tried several times to make his wife ovulate, but because of an anatomical problem they have not worked. When he left the office he asked for sperm freezing. Later I was told that he only wants to do this if his wife’s ovulation is confirmed, and he may want a fresh sperm sample instead. I would like to know the final plan so we can schedule the procedure correctly. At his request, Month DD, YYYY was chosen for the sperm collection, but this may change if a fresh sample is needed. Thank you for the opportunity to see him.\n\nSample Doctor, M.D."
