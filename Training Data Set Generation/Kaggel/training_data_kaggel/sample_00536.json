  "layman": "**Why the colonoscopy was done:**  \nA 79‑year‑old Filipino woman had stool that tested positive for blood. She was referred for a colonoscopy to check for diverticulosis (small pouches in the colon), inflammation of the colon (colitis), or cancer.\n\n**What happened during the procedure:**  \nThe doctor explained the colonoscopy, the possible risks (infection, a tear in the colon, a bad reaction to medicine, or bleeding). She signed a consent form.  \nShe lay on her left side and was given 4 mg of Versed and 75 mg of Demerol for sedation. Using an Olympus video colonoscope, the doctor carefully guided the scope to the cecum (the beginning of the large intestine). Images were taken of the opening of the appendix and the ileocecal valve. The cecum had a little stool, but the rest of the colon was clean enough for a good view.  \nNo obvious inflammation, abnormal blood vessels, or cancer was seen. The colon had moderate to severe diverticulosis throughout, which was photographed. The rectum looked normal, and a mild internal hemorrhoid was noted when the scope was turned back.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.\n\n**Findings:**  \n1. Colonoscope reached the cecum and the prep was good.  \n2. The colon was long, twisted, and spastic.  \n3. Moderate to severe diverticulosis throughout the colon.  \n4. Mild internal hemorrhoids.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Drink only clear liquids today.  \n2. Continue to see your primary care doctor as scheduled.  \n3. Add more fiber to your diet and strongly consider a fiber supplement."
