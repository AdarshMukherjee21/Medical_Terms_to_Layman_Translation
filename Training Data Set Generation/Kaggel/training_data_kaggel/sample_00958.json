The slices were 5 mm thick, and we also took 2.5‑mm slices without using any contrast dye. We made side‑view and front‑view images from the data.  \nDISCUSSION: We did not see any sudden problems inside the skull. There is no swelling of the brain, no shift of the brain’s center, no large growths or abnormal fluid pockets. The brain’s outer layer looks normal. The sinuses are clear. We did not find any new bone problems. Dr. Xyz gave a preliminary report to the emergency room when the scan finished.  \nIMPRESSION: No sudden problems inside the skull were found."
