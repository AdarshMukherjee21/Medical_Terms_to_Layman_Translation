Fascial lengthening flap of the 1st dorsal compartment. ANESTHESIA: MAC. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After MAC anesthesia and appropriate antibiotics were administered, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I made a transverse incision just distal to the radial styloid. Dissection was carried down directly to the 1st dorsal compartment with the superficial radial nerve identified and protected. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. I dissected the sheath superficially free of any other structures, specifically the superficial radial nerve. I then incised it under direct vision dorsal to its axis and incised it both proximally and distally. The EPB subsheath was likewise released. I irrigated the wound thoroughly. In order to prevent tendon subluxation, I then back-cut both the dorsal and volar leafs of the sheath so that I could close them in an extended and lengthened position. I did this with 3-0 Vicryl. I then passed an instrument underneath to check and make sure that the sheath was not too tight. I then irrigated it and closed the skin, and then I dressed and splinted the wrist appropriately. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",

Fascial lengthening flap of the 1st dorsal compartment.  \n\nANESTHESIA: MAC (monitored anesthesia care).  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nAfter the patient received MAC anesthesia and the proper antibiotics, the arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. The arm was emptied of blood with an Esmarch band and a tourniquet was set to 250 mmHg. I made a horizontal cut just below the radial styloid bone. I carefully cut down to the first dorsal compartment, finding and protecting the superficial radial nerve. I stopped bleeding with bipolar cautery. I separated the sheath from surrounding tissue, especially the superficial radial nerve, and cut it open under direct view, both near and far from the nerve. I also released the subsheath of the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB). I washed the area well. To keep the tendons from slipping out, I cut back both the back and front parts of the sheath so I could close them in a stretched, longer position. I used 3‑0 Vicryl sutures for this. I then passed an instrument under the sheath to make sure it wasn’t too tight. After another wash, I closed the skin, applied a dressing, and put a splint on the wrist. The patient went to recovery in good condition and tolerated the surgery well."
