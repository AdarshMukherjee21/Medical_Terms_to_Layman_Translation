  "medical": "CC: Headache. HX: This 37y/o LHM was seen one month prior to this presentation for HA, nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal evaluation at that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home. These symptoms had been recurrent since onset. At presentation he complained of mild blurred vision (OU), difficulty concentrating and HA which worsened upon sitting up. The headaches were especially noticeable in the early morning. He described them as non-throbbing headaches. They begin in the bifrontal region and radiate posteriorly. They occurred up to 6 times/day. The HA improved with lying down or dropping the head down between the knees towards the floor. The headaches were associated with blurred vision, nausea,vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. He denied any scotomata or positive visual phenomena. He denies any weakness, numbness, tingling, dysarthria or diplopia. His weight has fluctuated from 163# to 148# over the past 3 months and at present he weighs 154#. His appetite has been especially poor in the past month. MEDS:Sulfasalazine qid. Tylenol 650mg q4hours. PMH: 1)Ulcerative Colitis dx 1989. 2)HTN 3) occasional HAs since the early 1980s which are different in character and much less severe than his current HAs. They were not associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia or difficulty thinking. FHX: MGF with h/o stroke. Mother and Father were healthy. No h/o of migraine in family. SHX: Single. Works as a newpaper printing press worker. Denies tobacco, ETOH or illicit drug use, but admits he was a heavy drinker until the last 1970s when he quit. EXAM: BP159/92 HR 48 (sitting): BP126/70 HR48 (supine). RR14 36.2C MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech clear. Appears uncomfortable but acts appropriately and cooperatively. No difficulty with short and long term memory. CN: Grad 2-3 papilledema OS; Grade 1 papilledema (@2 o'clock) OD. Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Bilateral horizontal sustained nystagmus on right and leftward gaze. Bilateral vertical sustained nystagmus on up and downward gaze. Face symmetric with full movement and PP sensation. Tongue midline with full ROM. Gag and SCM were intact bilaterally. Motor: Full strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: Unremarkable. Coord: Mild dysynergia on FNF movements in BUE. HNS and RAM were unremarkable. Station: Unsteady with and without eyes open on Romberg test. No drift in any particular direction. Gait: Wide based, ataxic and to some degree magnetic and apraxic. Gen Exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: Urinalysis revealed 1-2RBC, 2-3WBC and bacteria were noted. Repeat Urinalysis was negative the next day. PT, PTT, CXR and GS were normal. CBC revealed 10.4WBC with 7.1Granulocytes. HCT, 10/18/95, revealed hydrocephalus. MRI, 10/18/95, revealed ventriculomegaly of the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles. There was enhancement of the meninges about the prepontine cisterna and internal auditory canals, and enhancement of a scar or inflammed lining of the foramen of Magendie. These changes were felt suggestive of bacterial or granulomatous meningitis. The patient underwent ventriculostomy on 10/19/94. CSF taken on 10/19/94 via V-P shunt insertion revealed: 22 WBC (21 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte), 380 RBC, Glucose 58, Protein 29, GS negative, Cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB) negative, Cryptococcal Antigen and India Ink were negative. Numerous CSF samples were taken from the lumbar region and shunt reservoir and these were consistantly unremarkable except for an occasional CSF protein of up to 99mg/dl. Serum and CSF toxoplasma titers and ACE levels were negative on multiple occasions. VDRL and HIV testing was unremarkable. 10/27/94 and 10/31/94 CSF cultures taken from the cervical region eventually grew non-encapsulated crytococcus neoformans. The patient was treated with amphotericin and showed some improvement. However, scarring had probably occurred by then and the V-P shunt was left in place.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint (CC):** Headache.\n\n**History of Present Illness (HX):**  \nA 37‑year‑old man with ulcerative colitis was seen one month ago for headache, nausea, and vomiting. A gastrointestinal exam then found no bowel blockage, and he was sent home. These symptoms have come and gone since they started. Today he reports mild blurred vision in both eyes, difficulty concentrating, and headaches that worsen when he sits up. The headaches are worse in the early morning. He says they are not throbbing. They begin in the forehead area and spread to the back of the head. They can happen up to six times a day. Lying down or bending the head toward the knees helps. The headaches are also linked to blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound. He has no visual spots or flashes, no weakness, numbness, tingling, slurred speech, or double vision. His weight has fluctuated from 163 to 148 pounds over the last three months; he now weighs 154 pounds. His appetite has been very poor for the past month.\n\n**Medications (MEDS):**  \n- Sulfasalazine, four times a day  \n- Tylenol 650 mg every 4 hours\n\n**Past Medical History (PMH):**  \n1. Ulcerative colitis diagnosed in 1989  \n2. High blood pressure  \n3. Occasional headaches since the early 1980s that were different and less severe than his current headaches; those earlier headaches did not have nausea, vomiting, light or sound sensitivity, or trouble thinking.\n\n**Family History (FHX):**  \nMother had a stroke. Father and mother are otherwise healthy. No family history of migraine.\n\n**Social History (SHX):**  \nSingle. Works at a newspaper printing press. Does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. He used to drink heavily until the late 1970s when he stopped.\n\n**Physical Examination (EXAM):**  \n- Blood pressure 159/92 and heart rate 48 while sitting; 126/70 and 48 while lying down.  \n- Respiratory rate 14. Temperature 36.2 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Speech is clear. He looks uncomfortable but is cooperative. No problems with short‑ or long‑term memory.  \n\n**Neurologic Exam:**  \n- Mild swelling of the optic discs in the left eye (grade 2‑3) and mild swelling in the right eye (grade 1).  \n- Pupils equal, 4 mm, constrict to 2 mm with light.  \n- Horizontal eye movements steady when looking right or left; vertical movements steady when looking up or down.  \n- Face symmetrical with full movement and sensation.  \n- Tongue midline, moves freely.  \n- Gag reflex and sternocleidomastoid muscle normal on both sides.  \n- Muscle strength, bulk, and tone normal throughout.  \n- Sensation normal.  \n- Mild difficulty with finger‑to‑nose movements in both arms.  \n- Hearing and balance normal.  \n- Unsteady when standing, with or without eyes open, but does not drift in any direction.  \n- Gait wide‑based, unsteady, somewhat magnetic, with some difficulty with movement.\n\n**General Exam:** Unremarkable.\n\n**Course and Investigations:**  \n- Urine test showed 1‑2 red cells, 2‑3 white cells, and bacteria. A repeat urine test the next day was negative.  \n- Blood clotting tests, chest X‑ray, and glucose were normal.  \n- Complete blood count: 10.4 k white cells, 7.1 k granulocytes.  \n- CT scan on 10/18/95 showed enlarged brain ventricles (hydrocephalus).  \n- MRI on the same day showed enlargement of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles, thickening of the meninges around the prepontine cistern and internal auditory canals, and thickening of the lining at the foramen of Magendie. These findings suggested bacterial or granulomatous meningitis.  \n- He had a ventriculostomy on 10/19/94. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken at that time through a shunt showed 22 white cells (21 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte), 380 red cells, glucose 58, protein 29, no glucose‑sugar test, and negative bacterial, fungal, and acid‑fast bacilli cultures. Cryptococcal antigen and India Ink were negative.  \n- Many CSF samples from the lumbar region and shunt reservoir were normal except for occasional protein up to 99 mg/dl.  \n- Blood and CSF tests for toxoplasma and ACE were negative on several occasions.  \n- VDRL and HIV tests were normal.  \n- CSF cultures taken on 10/27/94 and 10/31/94 from the cervical region grew non‑encapsulated Cryptococcus neoformans.  \n- He was treated with amphotericin and improved somewhat. By then scarring had probably already occurred, so the shunt was left in place."
