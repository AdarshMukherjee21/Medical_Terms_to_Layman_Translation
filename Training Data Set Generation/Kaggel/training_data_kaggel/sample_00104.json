  "medical": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This 71-year-old man went to his primary care physician for a routine physical. His only complaints were nocturia times two and a gradual &quot;slowing down&quot; feeling. The physical examination on 1/29 was within normal limits except for the digital rectal exam which revealed an asymmetric prostate gland with nodularity, R&gt;L. PSA was elevated. The differential diagnosis for the visit was abnormal prostate, suggestive of CA. IMAGING: CT pelvis: Irregular indentation of bladder. Seminal vesicles enlarged. Streaky densities in periprostatic fat consistent with transcapular spread to periprostatic plexus. Impression: prostatic malignancy with extracapsular extension and probable regional node metastasis. Bone scan: Negative for distant metastasis. LABORATORY: PSA 32.1 PROCEDURES: Transrectal needle biopsy of prostate. Pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy. PATHOLOGY: Prostate biopsy: Moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right lobe and poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the left lobe of prostate. Lymphadenectomy and prostatectomy: Frozen section of removed pelvic lymph nodes demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in one lymph node in the right obturator fossa. Therefore, the radical prostatectomy was canceled. Final pathology diagnosis: Pelvic lymphadenectomy; left obturator fossa, single negative lymph node. Right obturator fossa; metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1/5 lymph nodes. Largest involved node 1.5 cm. TREATMENT: Patient began external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis.",
  "layman": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A 71‑year‑old man came to his doctor for a routine check‑up. He only mentioned that he wakes up twice at night to pee and that he feels a bit “slower” than usual. The exam on January 29 was normal except for a digital rectal exam that showed his prostate was uneven and had bumps, more on the right side than the left. His PSA level was high. The doctors thought the problem might be an abnormal prostate, possibly cancer.\n\nIMAGING: A CT scan of the pelvis showed an irregular indentation of the bladder, enlarged seminal vesicles, and streaky spots in the fat around the prostate that look like cancer spreading beyond the prostate capsule to nearby lymph nodes. The impression was that the prostate had cancer that had spread outside the capsule and probably reached regional lymph nodes. A bone scan did not show any distant spread.\n\nLABORATORY: PSA was 32.1.\n\nPROCEDURES: The patient had a transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate, a pelvic lymph node removal (lymphadenectomy), and a planned radical prostatectomy.\n\nPATHOLOGY: The prostate biopsy showed moderate to poorly differentiated cancer in the right lobe and poorly differentiated tubular cancer in the left lobe. The frozen section of the removed pelvic lymph nodes found cancer in one node in the right obturator fossa, so the planned prostate removal was canceled. Final pathology: The left obturator fossa had one negative node. The right obturator fossa had cancer in 1 of 5 nodes, with the largest node measuring 1.5 cm.\n\nTREATMENT: The patient started external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis."
