  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right acute on chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right acute on chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis. PROCEDURE: Revision and in situ pinning of the right hip. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. LOCAL: 10 mL of 0.50% Marcaine local anesthetic. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 13-year-old girl who presented in November with an acute on chronic right slipped capital femoral epiphysis. She underwent in situ pinning. The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw. This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views. Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage. All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A small bump was placed underneath her right buttock. The right upper thigh was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. The upper aspect of the incision was reincised. The dissection was carried down to the crew, which was easily found. A guidewire was placed inside the screw with subsequent removal of the previous screw. The previous screw measured 65 mm. A 60 mm screw was then placed under direct visualization with fluoroscopy. The hip was taken through full range of motion to check on the length of the screw, which demonstrated no intraarticular protrusion. The guidewire was removed. The wound was then irrigated and closed using 2-0 Vicryl in the fascial layer as well as the subcutaneous fat. The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape. The area was infiltrated with total 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery. She should continue toe touch weightbearing on her leg. The wound may be wet in approximately 5 days. The patient should follow up in clinic in about 10 days. The patient is given Vicodin for pain. Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** The girl’s right hip had a slipped bone that was both new and old.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same condition.  \n**Procedure:** The surgeon replaced the old screw in the right hip with a new one that stays in place.  \n**Anesthesia:** The surgery was done while the patient was fully asleep.  \n**Complications:** None happened during the operation.  \n**Drains:** None were used.  \n**Specimens:** None were taken.  \n**Local anesthesia:** 10 mL of 0.50 % Marcaine was injected around the surgical area.  \n\n**History and physical exam:**  \nA 13‑year‑old girl came in November with a new slip on top of an old slip in her right hip. She had surgery before to put a screw in place. When she came back for a check‑up, the doctor saw that the screw was sticking out into the joint. The doctor didn’t see this when the first surgery was done. The doctor explained to her parents that the screw could damage the joint more and that it would need to be replaced with a shorter one. The risks of the new surgery—such as problems from anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in feeling or movement, the screw not coming out, or the joint staying stiff—were discussed. All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the plan.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe girl was taken to the operating room and laid on her back. She was put under general anesthesia. She received a pre‑operative antibiotic (Ancef). A small cushion was put under her right buttock. The right thigh was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The surgeon cut the skin again at the top of the old incision. The tissue was cut down to the bone, which was found easily. A guidewire was put inside the old screw, and the old 65 mm screw was removed. A new 60 mm screw was inserted while watching with a fluoroscope. The hip was moved through its full range of motion to make sure the new screw did not stick out into the joint. The guidewire was taken out. The wound was washed and closed with stitches: 2‑0 Vicryl for the deeper layers and 4‑0 Monocryl for the skin. The wound was cleaned, dried, and covered with Steri‑Strips, Xeroform, 4 × 4 gauze, and tape. A total of 10 mL of 0.5 % Marcaine was injected around the area for pain relief.  \n\n**Post‑operative plan:**  \nThe girl will go home the same day. She should keep weight on the leg only by touching the toes. The wound may get wet in about 5 days. She should come back to the clinic in about 10 days. She was given Vicodin for pain. The surgeon told her mother what happened during the operation."
