  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hydrocele. OPERATION: Left hydrocelectomy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hydrocele. ANESTHESIA: General INDICATIONS AND STUDIES: This is a 67-year-old male with pain, left scrotum. He has had an elevated PSA and also has erectile dysfunction. He comes in now for a left hydrocelectomy. Physical exam confirmed obvious hydrocele, left scrotum, approximately 8 cm. Laboratory data included a hematocrit of 43.5, hemoglobin of 15.0, and white count 4700. Creatinine 1.3, sodium 141, and potassium 4.0. Calcium 8.6. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. EKG was normal. PROCEDURE: The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia, prepped and draped in supine position, and left scrotal incision was made, carried down to the tunica vaginalis forming the hydrocele. This was dissected free from the scrotal wall back to the base of the testicle and then excised back to the spermatic cord. In the fashion, the hydrocele was excised and fluid drained. Cord was infiltrated with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The edges of the tunica vaginalis adjacent to the spermatic cord were oversewn with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures for hemostasis. The left testicle was replaced into the left scrotal compartment and affixed to the overlying Dartos fascia with a 3-0 Vicryl suture through the edge of the tunica vaginalis and the overlying Dartos fascia. The left scrotal incision was closed, first closing the Dartos fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin was closed with an interrupted running 4-0 chromic suture. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, upon awakening from general anesthesia. Plan is to discharge the patient and see him back in the office in a week or 2 in followup. Further plans will depend upon how he does.",

He has a high PSA level and erectile dysfunction. He is having surgery to remove a hydrocele on the left side. On exam the hydrocele was obvious and about 8 cm in size. Blood tests showed a hematocrit of 43.5, hemoglobin 15.0, white count 4700, creatinine 1.3, sodium 141, potassium 4.0, calcium 8.6. A chest X‑ray and an EKG were normal.\n\nPROCEDURE  \nThe patient received general anesthesia and was positioned on his back. A cut was made in the left scrotum and the hydrocele was exposed. The fluid was drained and the hydrocele was removed from the scrotal wall back to the base of the testicle and the spermatic cord. The cord was given 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine (a local anesthetic). The edges of the tunica vaginalis (the sac around the testicle) near the cord were stitched with 3‑0 Vicryl to stop bleeding. The testicle was put back into the scrotum and tied to the surrounding tissue with a 3‑0 Vicryl stitch. The scrotal incision was closed: first the deeper tissue (Dartos fascia) was stitched with 3‑0 Vicryl, then the skin was closed with a running 4‑0 chromic stitch. A sterile dressing was applied.\n\nThe patient was sent to recovery in good condition after waking from anesthesia. He will be discharged and should return to the office in one to two weeks for follow‑up. Further care will depend on how he recovers."
