  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Osteoarthritis, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Osteoarthritis, right knee. PROCEDURE: Right total knee arthroplasty. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the Operating Room and after the successful placement of an epidural, as well as general anesthesia, administration 1 gm of Ancef preoperatively, the patient's right thigh, knee and leg were scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg. A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component. At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially. A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert. This gave good stability and a full range of motion. The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for. A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly. The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation. Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples. A sterile, bulky compression dressing was placed. The patient was stable on operative release.",

An epidural and general anesthesia were given, and 1 gram of the antibiotic Ancef was given before surgery. The right thigh, knee and leg were cleaned, prepared and covered with sterile drapes. Blood was drained from the leg by gravity and a pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg. A straight incision was made on the front of the knee, cutting through skin and fat. Tissue flaps were lifted and a cut was made along the middle of the retinaculum next to the patella. The extensor mechanism was partially cut and the kneecap was turned out. Bone spurs on the femur were removed with a bone chisel and a rongeur. A drill hole was made in the lower part of the femur and the bone was cut to fit a 67.5‑mm femoral component. The ACL was removed. Fat pad, synovium, and both menisci were removed. A posterior cruciate retractor was used, the tibia was moved forward and a centered drill hole was made in the tibia. An intramedullary guide set at 8 mm was used to cut the tibia; an extra 2 mm was removed because of a moderate defect on the inside. A trial tibial baseplate of 71 mm was fitted, pinned and drilled, then a 10‑mm insert was tried. The knee was stable and moved through a full range of motion. The kneecap was measured and 9 mm of bone was cut off with an oscillating saw. A 34‑mm component was prepared. Another trial reduction was done and 2 liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bone surfaces. Cement was mixed by hand and pressed into the upper tibia with a spatula. Several drill holes were made on the inside of the tibia where the bone was a bit hard. The tibial baseplate was fixed and the kneecap was put in place and held with a clamp. Extra cement was removed. The tibial baseplate and femoral component were locked in place. The knee was held straight for 5–6 minutes while the cement set. More excess cement was removed. The tourniquet was released and bleeding was stopped with electrocautery. The retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were stitched together with figure‑of‑eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the under‑skin with 2‑0 sutures and the skin with staples. A thick sterile compression dressing was applied. The patient was stable after the operation."
