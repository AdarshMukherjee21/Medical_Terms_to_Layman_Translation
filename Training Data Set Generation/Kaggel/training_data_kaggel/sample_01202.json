  "medical": "CC: Right shoulder pain. HX: This 46 y/o RHF presented with a 4 month history of right neck and shoulder stiffness and pain. The symptoms progressively worsened over the 4 month course. 2 weeks prior to presentation she began to develop numbness in the first and second fingers of her right hand and RUE pain. The later was described as a throbbing pain. She also experienced numbness in both lower extremities and pain in the coccygeal region. The pains worsened at night and impaired sleep. She denied any visual change, bowel or bladder difficulties and symptoms involving the LUE. She occasionally experienced an electric shock like sensation shooting down her spine when flexing her neck (Lhermitte's phenomena). She denied any history of neck/back/head trauma. She had been taking Naprosyn with little relief. PMH: 1) Catamenial Headaches. 2) Allergy to Macrodantin. SHX/FHX: Smokes 2ppd cigarettes. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. CN: unremarkable. Motor: full strength throughout. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: No deficits on LT/PP/VIB/TEMP/PROP testing. Coord/Gait/Station: Unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 in BUE except 2+ at left biceps. 1+/1+BLE except an absent right ankle reflex. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rectal exam: normal tone. IMPRESSION: C-spine lesion. COURSE: MRI C-spine revealed a central C5-6 disk herniation with compression of the spinal cord at that level. EMG/NCV showed normal NCV, but 1+ sharps and fibrillations in the right biceps (C5-6), brachioradialis (C5-6), triceps (C7-8) and teres major; and 2+ sharps and fibrillations in the right pronator terres. There was increased insertional activity in all muscles tested on the right side. The findings were consistent with a C6-7 radiculopathy. The patient subsequently underwent C5-6 laminectomy and her symptoms resolved.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Pain in the right shoulder.  \n\n**History:** A 46‑year‑old woman with a history of right heart failure came to the doctor because she had been having stiffness and pain in her right neck and shoulder for four months. The pain got worse over time. Two weeks before she saw the doctor, she started feeling numbness in the first two fingers of her right hand and had throbbing pain in her right upper arm. She also felt numbness in both legs and pain in the tailbone area. The pain was worse at night and made it hard to sleep. She had no changes in vision, no problems with bowel or bladder, and no symptoms in her left arm. Sometimes, when she bent her neck, she felt an electric‑shock sensation down her spine (Lhermitte’s sign). She had never had any neck, back, or head injuries. She had been taking Naprosyn, but it helped only a little.  \n\nPast medical history:  \n1. Catamenial headaches (headaches that happen around menstruation).  \n2. Allergy to Macrodantin.  \n\nSocial/family history: She smokes two cigarettes a day.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Vital signs were normal.  \n- Cranial nerves were normal.  \n- Muscle strength was normal everywhere.  \n- Muscle tone and size were normal.  \n- Sensation (light touch, pain, vibration, temperature, proprioception) was normal.  \n- Coordination, walking, and balance were normal.  \n- Reflexes were 2/2 in both arms, except the left biceps was 2+. Reflexes were 1+ in both legs, but the right ankle reflex was absent. Plantar responses (foot reflexes) were normal.  \n- Rectal exam showed normal tone.  \n\n**Impression:** Something in the cervical spine (neck area).  \n\n**Course:** An MRI of the cervical spine showed a herniated disc at the C5‑C6 level that was pressing on the spinal cord. Nerve studies (EMG/NCV) were normal for nerve conduction, but there were small sharp waves and muscle twitching in several right arm muscles (C5‑C6 and C7‑8 levels). There was also increased activity in all right‑side muscles tested. These findings matched a C6‑C7 nerve root problem. The patient had surgery (C5‑C6 laminectomy) and her symptoms went away."
