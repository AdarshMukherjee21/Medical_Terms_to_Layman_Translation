  "medical": "The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum, as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.",
  "layman": "The patient was turned onto their left side and given the medications mentioned earlier. A colonoscope was carefully inserted until it reached the cecum, which was identified by the ileocecal valve, the opening of the appendix, and the blind pouch. The scope was then slowly pulled back while the doctor closely examined the lining of the colon, also looking at the rectum from a backward angle. Everything else in the colon looked normal up to the cecum. The patient handled the procedure well and had no complications."
