Left diabetic foot abscess and infection. 2. Left calcaneus fracture with infection. 3. Right first ray amputation. OPERATION AND PROCEDURE: 1. Left below-the-knee amputation. 2. Dressing change, right foot. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. TOURNIQUET TIME: 24 minutes on the left, 300 mmHg. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAINS: A one-eighth-inch Hemovac. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 62 years of age with diabetes. He developed left heel abscess. He had previous debridements, developed a calcaneal fracture and has now had several debridement with placement of the antibiotic beads. After re-inspecting the wound last week, the plan was for possible debridement and he desired below-the-knee amputation. We are going to change the dressing on the right side also. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery were discussed. The risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, persistent wound healing problems, and the need for future surgery. He understood all the risks and desired operative treatment. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After appropriate informed consent obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. General anesthesia induced. Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, cast padding placed on the left proximal thigh and tourniquet was applied. The right leg was redressed. I took the dressing down. There was a small bit of central drainage, but it was healing nicely. Adaptic and new sterile dressings were applied. The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A transverse incision made about the mid shaft of the tibia. A long posterior flap was created. It was taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery. Please note that tourniquet had been inflated after exsanguination of the limb. Superficial peroneal nerve identified, clamped, and cut. Anterior compartment was divided. The anterior neurovascular bundle identified, clamped, and cut. The plane was taken between the deep and superficial compartments. The superficial compartment was reflected posteriorly. Tibial nerve identified, clamped, and cut. Tibial vessels identified, clamped, and cut. Periosteum of the tibia elevated proximally along with the fibula. The tibia was then cut with Gigli saw. It was beveled anteriorly and smoothed down with a rasp. The fibula was cut about a cm and a half proximal to this using a large bone cutter. The remaining posterior compartment was divided. The peroneal bundle identified, clamped, and cut. The leg was then passed off of the field. Each vascular bundle was then doubly ligated with 0 silk stick tie and 0 silk free tie. The nerves were each pulled at length, injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine, cut, and later retracted proximally. The tourniquet was released. Good bleeding from the tissues and hemostasis obtained with electrocautery. Copious irrigation performed using antibiotic-impregnated solution. A one-eighth-inch Hemovac drain placed in the depth of wound adhering on the medial side. A gastroc soleus fascia brought up and attached to the anterior fascia and periosteum with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The remaining fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl. Subcutaneous tissues were then closed with 2-0 PDS suture using 2-0 Monocryl suture in interrupted fashion. Skin closed with skin staples. Xeroform gauze, 4 x 4, and a padded soft dressing applied. He was placed in a well-padded anterior and posterior slab splint with the knee in extension. He was then awakened, extubated, and taken to recovery in stable condition. There were no immediate operative complications, and he tolerated the procedure well.",

Amputation of the right first toe.  \n\nOPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES  \n1. Below‑the‑knee amputation of the left leg.  \n2. Change of the dressing on the right foot.  \n\nANESTHESIA  \nGeneral (the patient was fully asleep).  \n\nBLOOD LOSS  \nLess than 100 milliliters.  \n\nTOURNIQUET (blood‑stopper)  \nUsed on the left leg for 24 minutes at 300 mmHg.  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS  \nNone.  \n\nDRAIN  \nA one‑eighth‑inch Hemovac drain was placed.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR SURGERY  \nThe patient is a 62‑year‑old man with diabetes. He had an abscess in his left heel. He had earlier clean‑ups (debridements), then a fracture of the heel bone, and more clean‑ups with antibiotic beads. After checking the wound last week, the plan was to possibly clean it again, but the patient wanted a below‑the‑knee amputation. We also needed to change the dressing on his right foot. We talked about the risks, benefits, and other options. The risks include bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, problems with wound healing, and the chance of needing more surgery later. He understood all of this and chose to have the surgery.  \n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE (DETAILS)  \nAfter the patient gave consent, he was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. General anesthesia was started. Once he was fully asleep, padding was put on the left thigh and a tourniquet was applied. The right leg was cleaned and the old dressing was removed. A small amount of drainage was seen, but the wound was healing well. New sterile dressings were put on.  \n\nThe left leg was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A horizontal cut was made around the middle of the shin bone (tibia). A long flap of skin and tissue was lifted back. The skin and tissue were cut with a cautery device. The tourniquet was inflated after the leg was drained of blood. The superficial peroneal nerve was found, clamped, and cut. The front compartment of the leg was split open. The front nerve and blood vessel bundle was found, clamped, and cut. The space between the deep and front compartments was opened. The front compartment was moved back. The tibial nerve was found, clamped, and cut. The tibial blood vessels were found, clamped, and cut. The outer layer of the shin bone and the fibula were lifted up. The shin bone was cut with a Gigli saw, shaped, and smoothed. The fibula was cut about 1.5 cm above that point with a bone cutter. The back compartment was split open. The peroneal nerve bundle was found, clamped, and cut.  \n\nThe leg was moved out of the field. Each blood vessel bundle was tied off twice with silk sutures. The nerves were pulled out, given a local anesthetic with epinephrine, cut, and then pulled back. The tourniquet was released. Blood was controlled with cautery. The area was washed thoroughly with an antibiotic solution. A one‑eighth‑inch Hemovac drain was placed deep in the wound on the inside. The calf muscle fascia was pulled up and sewn to the front fascia and bone with #1 Vicryl stitches. The rest of the fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl. The under‑skin tissue was closed with 2‑0 PDS and 2‑0 Monocryl stitches. The skin was closed with staples. A 4×4 Xeroform gauze and a padded dressing were applied. The patient was put in a padded slab splint with the knee straight.  \n\nHe woke up, was taken off the breathing tube, and went to recovery in stable condition. There were no immediate complications, and he tolerated the procedure well."
