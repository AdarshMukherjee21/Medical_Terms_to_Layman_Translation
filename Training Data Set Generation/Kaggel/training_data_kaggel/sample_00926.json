  "medical": "CC: Falls. HX: This 51y/o RHF fell four times on 1/3/93, because her &quot;legs suddenly gave out.&quot; She subsequently noticed weakness involving the right leg, and often required the assistance of her arms to move it. During some of these episodes she appeared mildly pale and felt generally weak; her husband would give her 3 teaspoons of sugar and she would appear to improve, thought not completely. During one episode she held her RUE in an &quot;odd fisted posture.&quot; She denied any other focal weakness, sensory change, dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia or alteration of consciousness. She did not seek medical attention despite her weakness. Then, last night, 1/4/93, she fell again ,and because her weakness did not subsequently improve she came to UIHC for evaluation on 1/5/93. MEDS: Micronase 5mg qd, HCTZ, quit ASA 6 months ago (tired of taking it). PMH: 1)DM type 2, dx 6 months ago. 2)HTN. 3)DJD. 4)s/p Vitrectomy and retinal traction OU for retinal detachment 7/92. 5) s/p Cholecystemomy,1968. 6) Cataract implant, OU,1992. 7) s/p C-section. FHX: Grand Aunt (stroke), MG (CAD), Mother (CAD, died MI age 63), Father (with unknown CA), Sisters (HTN), No DM in relatives. SHX: Married, lives with husband, 4 children alive and well. Denied tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. ROS: intermittent diarrhea for 20 years. EXAM: BP164/82 HR64 RR18 36.0C MS: A & O to person, place, time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Intact naming, comprehension, reading. CN: Pupils 4.5 (irregular)/4.0 (irregular) and virtually fixed. Optic disks flat. EOM intact. VFFTC. Right lower facial weakness. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE with some question of breakaway. LE: HF and HE 4+/5, KF5/5, AF and AE 5/5. Normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: intact PP/VIB/PROP/LT/T/graphesthesia. Coord: slowed FNF and HKS (worse on right). Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign. Gait: Unsteady wide-based gait. Unable to heel walk on right. Reflexes: 2/2+ throughout (Slightly more brisk on right). Plantar responses were downgoing bilaterally. HEENT: N0 Carotid or cranial bruits. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: CBC, GS (including glucose), PT/PTT, EKG, CXR on admission, 1/5/93, were unremarkable. HCT, 1/5/93, revealed a hypodensity in the left caudate consistent with ischemic change. Carotid Duplex: 0-15%RICA, 16-49%LICA; antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed borderline LV hypertrophy and normal LV function. No valvular abnormalities or thrombus were seen. The patient's history and exam findings of right facial and RLE weakness with sparing of the RUE would invoke a RACA territory stroke with recurrent artery of Heubner involvement causing the facial weakness.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Falling\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nA 51‑year‑old right‑handed woman fell four times on January 3, 1993. She said her legs “suddenly gave out.” After the falls she felt weak in her right leg and often had to use her arms to move it. During some episodes she looked a little pale and felt weak; her husband gave her three teaspoons of sugar, which helped but did not fully fix the problem. On one fall she held her right arm in an odd, fist‑like position. She denied weakness elsewhere, numbness, trouble speaking, double vision, trouble swallowing, or changes in consciousness. She did not go to the doctor until the next day, January 4, when she fell again and her weakness did not improve, so she came to the hospital on January 5.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Micronase 5 mg once daily  \n- Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)  \n- Stopped aspirin 6 months ago because she was tired of taking it\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1. Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 6 months ago  \n2. High blood pressure (hypertension)  \n3. Degenerative joint disease (arthritis)  \n4. Eye surgery for retinal detachment (both eyes) in July 1992  \n5. Gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) in 1968  \n6. Cataract surgery with implants in both eyes in 1992  \n7. C‑section delivery\n\n**Family History:**  \n- Grand aunt had a stroke  \n- Mother had coronary artery disease (CAD) and died of a heart attack at age 63  \n- Father has an unknown cancer  \n- Sisters have high blood pressure  \n- No family members have diabetes\n\n**Social History:**  \nMarried, lives with husband, has four healthy children. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- Intermittent diarrhea for 20 years\n\n**Physical Examination (January 5):**  \n- Blood pressure 164/82 mm Hg, heart rate 64 bpm, breathing 18 breaths/min, temperature 36.0 °C  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time  \n- Speech fluent, no slurring  \n- Naming, understanding, and reading normal  \n- Cranial nerves: pupils 4.5 mm and 4.0 mm, irregular and almost fixed; optic discs flat; eye movements normal; full visual fields; mild weakness of the lower part of the right face; other cranial nerves normal  \n- Muscles: upper limbs 5/5 strength, some slight weakness; lower limbs: hip and knee 4+/5, ankle 5/5, foot 5/5; muscle bulk and tone normal  \n- Sensation: normal to pain, vibration, proprioception, light touch, temperature, and graphesthesia  \n- Coordination: slowed finger‑to‑nose and heel‑to‑shin tests, worse on the right side  \n- No pronator drift or balance problems (Romberg)  \n- Gait: wide‑based and unsteady; could not heel‑walk on the right side  \n- Reflexes 2/2+ everywhere, a little brisker on the right; plantar responses down‑going on both feet  \n\n**Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat:** No carotid or cranial bruits.  \n**General:** No other abnormal findings.\n\n**Hospital Course (January 5):**  \nBlood tests (CBC, glucose, clotting studies), ECG, and chest X‑ray were all normal. A blood count showed a low density area in the left caudate nucleus of the brain, indicating a possible stroke. Carotid ultrasound showed 0–15 % narrowing of the right internal carotid artery and 16–49 % narrowing of the left internal carotid artery; vertebral arteries were normal. An echocardiogram showed borderline thickening of the left ventricle but normal pumping function, with no valve problems or clots.\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nThe pattern of weakness in the right face and right leg, with the right arm spared, suggests a stroke in the right anterior cerebral artery territory, involving the recurrent artery of Heubner, which explains the facial weakness."
