Upon evaluation locally, he had a temperature of 99.5F and appeared lethargic. He also had anisocoria with left pupil 0.5mm bigger than the right. There was also question of left facial weakness. An MRI was obtained and revealed a large left hemispheric mass lesion with surrounding edema and mass effect. He was given 10mg of IV Decardron,100gm of IV Mannitol, intubated and hyperventilated and transferred to UIHC. He was admitted to the Department of Medicine on 7/14/95, and transferred to the Department of Neurology on 7/17/95, after being extubated.

He developed chronic diarrhea and was switched to D4T in 1/95. However, he developed severe neuropathy and this was stopped 4/95. The diarrhea recured. He has Acyclovir resistant genital herpes and generalized psoriasis. He most recent CD4 count (within 1 month of admission) was 20. FHX: HTN and multiple malignancies of unknown type. SHX: Homosexual, in monogamous relationship with an HIV infected partner for the past 3 years. EXAM: 7/14/95 (by Internal Medicine): BP134/80, HR118, RR16 on vent, 38.2C, Intubated.

Babinski sign present on right and absent on left. Gen Exam: unremarkable except for the genital lesion noted by Internal medicine. COURSE: The outside MRI was reviewed and was notable for the left frontal/parietal mass lesion with surround edema. The mass inhomogenously enhanced with gadolinium contrast. The findings were consistent most with lymphoma, though toxoplasmosis could not be excluded. He refused brain biopsy and was started on empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis. This consisted of Pyrimethamine 75mg qd and Sulfadiazine 2 g bid. He later became DNR and was transferred at his and his partner's request Back to a local hospital. He never returned for follow-up.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: Lethargy.  \n\n**History** – A 28‑year‑old man with HIV was admitted to a local hospital on July 14, 1995 because he was very tired. He had been having occasional headaches and some personality changes for about two weeks before that. On the morning of July 14, his partner found him very sleepy, said he had stomach pain, and that he was vomiting. He denied fever, chills, sweats, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, or diarrhea. At the local hospital his temperature was 99.5 °F and he looked tired. His pupils were unequal; the left pupil was 0.5 mm larger than the right. There was also a question of weakness on the left side of his face. An MRI scan showed a large mass in the left side of his brain with swelling around it and pressure on the brain. He was given 10 mg of IV Decadron, 100 g of IV Mannitol, was intubated and hyperventilated, and then transferred to UIHC. He was admitted to the Department of Medicine on July 14 and moved to Neurology on July 17 after being taken off the ventilator.  \n\n**Medications on admission** – Bactrim DS once daily, Diflucan 100 mg once daily, Acyclovir 400 mg twice daily, Xanax, Stavudine 40 mg twice daily, Rifabutin 300 mg once daily.  \n\n**Past medical history** – 1) surgery for pyloric stenosis at age 1, 2) appendectomy, 3) HIV/AIDS diagnosed in 1991. He was first treated with AZT, then DDI. He developed chronic diarrhea and was switched to D4T in January 1995. He then had severe nerve pain and stopped it in April 1995. The diarrhea returned. He has acyclovir‑resistant genital herpes and generalized psoriasis. His most recent CD4 count (within a month of admission) was 20.  \n\n**Family history** – hypertension and several cancers of unknown type.  \n\n**Sexual history** – homosexual, in a monogamous relationship with an HIV‑infected partner for the past 3 years.  \n\n**Exam on July 14 by Internal Medicine** – BP 134/80, HR 118, RR 16 on ventilator, 38.2 °C, intubated. Mental status: sleepy but opened eyes to loud voices and could follow most commands. Cranial nerves: pupils 2.5/3.0 and “equally reactive to light.” Mild horizontal nystagmus when looking right. Eye movements otherwise normal. Motor: moved all four limbs well. Sensory, coordination, gait, stance, reflexes not done. Genital exam: penile ulcerations.  \n\n**Exam on July 17 by Neurology** – BP 144/73, HR 59, RR 20, 36.0 °C, extubated. Mental status: alert but mildly sleepy. Only oriented to name. Thought he was at a local hospital and that it was January 17, 1994. Did not understand he had a brain lesion. Cranial nerves: pupils 6/5.5 decreasing to 4/4 with light. Eye movements full and smooth. No relative afferent pupillary defect or light‑near dissociation. Papilledema in both eyes. Right lower facial weakness, facial sensation intact. Gag‑shrug and corneal reflexes intact, both sides. Tongue midline. Motor: strength 5‑ on right side. Sensory: no loss on pinprick, vibration, proprioception. Coordination: reduced speed and accuracy on right finger‑to‑nose and right heel‑to‑shin. Stance: right upper‑extremity pronator drift. Gait not done. Reflexes 2+/2 throughout. Babinski present on right, absent on left. Genital exam: unremarkable except for the genital lesion noted earlier.  \n\n**Course** – The outside MRI was reviewed and showed a left frontal/parietal mass with swelling around it. The mass enhanced unevenly with contrast. Findings were most consistent with lymphoma, but toxoplasmosis could not be ruled out. He refused brain biopsy and was started on empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis: Pyrimethamine 75 mg once daily and Sulfadiazine 2 g twice daily. He later became DNR and was transferred at his and his partner’s request back to a local hospital. He never returned for follow‑up."
