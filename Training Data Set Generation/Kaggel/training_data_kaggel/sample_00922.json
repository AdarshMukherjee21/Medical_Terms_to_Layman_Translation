  "medical": "EXAM: MRI orbit/face/neck with and without contrast; MR angiography of the head CLINICAL HISTORY: 1-day-old female with facial mass. TECHNIQUE: 1. Multisequence, multiplanar images of the orbits/face/neck were obtained with and without contrast. 0.5 ml Magnevist was used as the intravenous contrast agent. 2. MR angiography of the head was obtained using a time-of-flight technique. 3. The patient was under general anesthesia during the exam. FINDINGS: MRI orbits/face/neck: There is a pedunculated mass measuring 5.7 x 4.4 x 6.7 cm arising from the patient's lip on the right side. The mass demonstrates a heterogeneous signal. There is also heterogeneous enhancement which may relate to a high vascular tumor given the small amount of contrast for the exam. The origin of the mass from the upper lip demonstrates intact soft tissue planes. Limited evaluation of the head demonstrates normal appearing midline structures. Incidental note is made of a small arachnoid cyst within the anterior left middle cranial fossa. The mastoid air cells on the right are opacified; while the left demonstrates appropriate aeration. MR angiography of the head: Angiography is limited such that the vessel feeding the mass cannot be identified with certainty. The right external carotid artery is noted to be asymmetrically larger than the left, the phenomenon likely related to provision of feeding vessels to the mass. There is no carotid stenosis. IMPRESSION: 1. The mass arising from the right upper lip measures 5.7 x 4.4 x 6.7 cm with a heterogeneous appearance and enhancement pattern. Hemangioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis as well as other mesenchymal neoplasms. 2. MR angiography is suboptimal such that feeding vessels to the mass cannot be identified with certainty.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the eye area, face, and neck with and without contrast; MR angiography of the head  \nCLINICAL HISTORY: A 1‑day‑old baby girl with a facial lump.  \n\nTECHNIQUE:  \n1. Images of the eyes, face, and neck were taken in several planes, both before and after giving a small amount of contrast (0.5 ml of Magnevist) through an IV.  \n2. A time‑of‑flight MR angiogram of the head was performed.  \n3. The baby was under general anesthesia during the scan.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \nMRI of the eye area, face, and neck:  \n- There is a stalk‑like lump on the right upper lip that measures about 5.7 cm by 4.4 cm by 6.7 cm.  \n- The lump shows mixed signal intensity and uneven enhancement, which may suggest a highly vascular tumor, especially since only a small amount of contrast was used.  \n- The lump arises from the upper lip and the surrounding soft tissues look intact.  \n- The midline structures of the head appear normal.  \n- A small arachnoid cyst is seen in the front part of the left middle cranial fossa.  \n- The right mastoid air cells are filled (opacified); the left side is normally aerated.  \n\nMR angiography of the head:  \n- The study is limited, so the artery feeding the lump cannot be identified with certainty.  \n- The right external carotid artery is larger than the left, likely because it supplies the lump.  \n- There is no narrowing of the carotid arteries.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. The lump on the right upper lip is 5.7 cm × 4.4 cm × 6.7 cm, shows mixed appearance and enhancement. A hemangioma should be considered, along with other soft‑tissue tumors.  \n2. The MR angiogram is not detailed enough to confirm the feeding vessels to the lump."
