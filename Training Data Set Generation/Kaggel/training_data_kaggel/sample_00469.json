Funduscopic examination is normal. Extraocular movements full. Pupils equal, round, react to light. There is no evidence of nystagmus noted. Fifth nerve function is normal. There is no facial asymmetry noted. Lower cranial nerves are normal. Manual motor testing reveals good tone and bulk throughout. There is no evidence of pronator drift or decreased fine finger movements. Muscle strength is 5/5 throughout. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ throughout with downgoing toes. Sensory examination is intact to all modalities including stereognosis, graphesthesia. TESTING OF STATION AND GAIT: The patient is able to walk toe-heel and tandem walk. Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin moves are normal. Romberg sign negative. I appreciate no carotid bruits or cardiac murmurs. Noncontrast CT scan of the head shows no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.",

The nerves that control the face and throat are fine. The face looks symmetrical. Muscle tone and size are normal, and there is no weakness or loss of fine finger control. Muscle strength is full (5/5) in all limbs. Reflexes are normal (2+) and the toes point downward. Sensation is normal, including the ability to feel shapes and recognize writing on the skin.\n\n**Balance and walking:** The patient can walk heel-to-toe and in a straight line. They can do finger‑to‑nose and heel‑to‑shin tests normally. The Romberg test (standing still with eyes closed) is negative. No unusual sounds were heard in the neck or heart. A head CT scan without contrast shows no new stroke, bleeding, or extra brain fluid."
