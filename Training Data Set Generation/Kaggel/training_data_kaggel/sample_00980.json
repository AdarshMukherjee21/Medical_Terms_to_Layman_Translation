  "medical": "CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Motor vehicle collision. CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained. FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection. The ventricles and cortical sulci are normal in shape and configuration. The gray/white matter junctions are well preserved. There is no calvarial fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: Negative for acute intracranial disease. CT CERVICAL SPINE TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained. Sagittal and coronal images were obtained. FINDINGS: Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis is compatible with patient position versus muscle spasms. No fracture or subluxation is seen. Anterior and posterior osteophyte formation is seen at C5-C6. No abnormal anterior cervical soft tissue swelling is seen. No spinal compression is noted. The atlanto-dens interval is normal. There is a large retention cyst versus polyp within the right maxillary sinus. IMPRESSION: 1. Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis compatible with patient positioning versus muscle spasms. 2. Degenerative disk and joint disease at C5-C6. 3. Retention cyst versus polyp of the right maxillary sinus.",
  "layman": "CT scan of the head and neck (no dye used)\n\n**Reason for the exam**  \nYou were in a car accident.\n\n**Head scan**  \nThe scan shows no bleeding, swelling, or shift of the brain. The brain’s shape and the spaces around it look normal. The gray‑white matter border is clear. There is no skull fracture. The sinuses and ear air cells that we could see are clear.\n\n**Conclusion for the head**  \nNo new brain problems were found.\n\n**Neck scan**  \nThe scan was taken in several angles. The normal curve of the neck is a little straightened, which can happen because of how you were positioned or muscle tension. There is no broken bone or joint dislocation. Small bone spurs are present at the C5‑C6 level. The soft tissues in front of the neck are normal and there is no pressure on the spinal cord. The space between the top of the skull and the first neck bone is normal. A large cyst or polyp is seen in the right maxillary sinus.\n\n**Conclusion for the neck**  \n1. The straightened neck curve is likely due to positioning or muscle tension.  \n2. Degenerative changes (bone spurs) at the C5‑C6 level.  \n3. A cyst or polyp in the right maxillary sinus."
