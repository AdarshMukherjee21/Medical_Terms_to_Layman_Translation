  "medical": "MM/DD/YYYY XYZ, D.C. Re: ABC Dear Dr. XYZ: I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, ABC, today MM/DD/YYYY in consultation. He is an unfortunate 19-year-old right-handed male who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY, where he was the driver of an automobile, which was struck on the front passenger's side. The patient sustained impact injuries to his neck and lower back. There was no apparent head injury or loss of consciousness and he denied any posttraumatic seizures. He was taken to Hospital, x-rays were taken, apparently which were negative and he was released. At the present time, he complains of neck and lower back pain radiating into his right arm and right leg with weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in his right arm and right leg. He has had no difficulty with bowel or bladder function. He does experience intermittent headaches associated with his neck pain with no other associated symptoms. PAST HEALTH: He was injured in a prior motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY. At the time of his most recent injuries, he was completely symptom free and under no active therapy. There is no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, ulcers or tuberculosis. SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco or alcohol consumption. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: None. FAMILY HISTORY: Otherwise noncontributory. FUNCTIONAL INQUIRY: Otherwise noncontributory. REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Includes an MRI scan of the cervical spine dated MM/DD/YYYY which showed evidence for disc bulging at the C6-C7 level. MRI scan of the lumbar spine on MM/DD/YYYY, showed evidence of a disc herniation at the L1-L2 level as well as a disc protrusion at the L2-L3 level with disc herniations at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 level and disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals an alert and oriented male with normal language function. Vital Signs: Blood pressure was 105/68 in the left arm sitting. Heart rate was 70 and regular. Height was 5 feet 8 inches. Weight was 182 pounds. Cranial nerve evaluation was unremarkable. Pupils were equal and reactive. Funduscopic evaluation was clear. There was no evidence for nystagmus. There was decreased range of motion noted in both the cervical and lumbar regions to a significant degree, with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature. Straight leg raising was limited to 45 degrees on the right and 90 degrees on the left. Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale. Reflexes were 2+ symmetrical and active. No pathological responses were noted. Sensory examination showed a diffuse decreased sensation to pinprick in the right upper extremity. Cerebellar function was normal. There was normal station and gait. Chest and cardiovascular evaluations were unremarkable. Heart sounds were normal. There were no extra sounds or murmurs. Palpable trigger points were noted in the right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Reveals a 19-year-old male suffering from a posttraumatic cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, secondary to traumatic injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY. In view of the persistent radicular complaints associated with the weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling as well as the objective sensory loss noted on today's evaluation as well as the non-specific nature of the radiculopathy, I have scheduled him for an EMG study on his right upper and right lower extremity in two week's time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of his symptoms. Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation. He is suffering from ongoing myofascitis. His treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections to be initiated at his next follow up visit in two weeks' time. I have encouraged him to continue with his ongoing treatment program under your care and supervision. I will be following him in two weeks' time. Once again, thank you kindly for allowing me to participate in this patient's care and management. Yours sincerely,",

He is a 19‑year‑old right‑handed male who was injured in a car accident on MM/DD/YYYY. He was driving when his car was hit on the front passenger side. He suffered impact injuries to his neck and lower back. He did not hit his head, did not lose consciousness, and did not have seizures after the crash. He was taken to the hospital, had x‑rays taken, which were normal, and he was released.\n\nAt this visit he reports neck and lower back pain that radiates into his right arm and right leg. He also has weakness, numbness, tingling, and a pins‑and‑needles feeling in those areas. He has no problems with bowel or bladder control. He has occasional headaches that come with the neck pain, but no other symptoms.\n\n**Past health**  \nHe was injured in a previous car accident on MM/DD/YYYY. At that time he had no symptoms and was not receiving treatment. He has no history of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, neurological problems, ulcers, or tuberculosis.\n\n**Social history**  \nHe does not smoke or drink alcohol.\n\n**Allergies**  \nNo known drug allergies.\n\n**Current medications**  \nNone.\n\n**Family history**  \nNo significant medical problems in the family.\n\n**Functional status**  \nNo issues.\n\n**Diagnostic studies**  \nAn MRI of his cervical spine on MM/DD/YYYY showed a bulging disc at the C6‑C7 level. An MRI of his lumbar spine on MM/DD/YYYY showed a herniated disc at L1‑L2, a protruding disc at L2‑L3, herniations at L3‑L4 and L4‑L5, and a protruding disc at L5‑S1.\n\n**Physical examination**  \nHe is alert, oriented, and speaks normally.  \nVital signs: blood pressure 105/68 in the left arm while sitting, heart rate 70 beats per minute and regular. Height 5 feet 8 inches, weight 182 pounds.  \nEye exam: pupils equal and reactive, no eye movement problems.  \nNeck and back: limited range of motion, tenderness and muscle spasms in the back.  \nStraight‑leg‑raise test: 45° on the right, 90° on the left.  \nMuscle strength 5/5 everywhere. Reflexes normal. No abnormal reflexes.  \nSensation: decreased feeling to pinprick in his right arm.  \nBalance and gait normal.  \nHeart sounds normal, no extra sounds or murmurs.  \nTrigger points found in the right shoulder‑blade area and in the right neck and lower back muscles.\n\n**Clinical impression**  \nHe has a post‑traumatic nerve problem in his neck and lower back caused by the car accident. His ongoing pain, weakness, numbness, tingling, and sensory loss are consistent with this. Because the exact cause is not clear, I have scheduled an EMG test of his right arm and right leg in two weeks to see if the nerves are irritated or trapped. I also noted trigger points and plan to give injections at his next visit in two weeks. I have encouraged him to keep working with you on his treatment. I will follow up in two weeks.\n\nThank you for allowing me to help with his care.\n\nYours sincerely,"
