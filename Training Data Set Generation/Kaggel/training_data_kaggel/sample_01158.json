  "medical": "Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position and prepped and draped in the usual manner. A transverse inguinal skin crease incision was made and carried down through the skin to the external oblique aponeurosis. Hemostasis was obtained with Bovie. Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ilioinguinal nerve. The external oblique aponeurosis was identified and a small incision was made in the line of its fibers and extended with scissors, avoiding any nerve injury. The spermatic cord was dissected free of the shelving edge of the external oblique aponeurosis and dissected free from the surrounding tissue. The hernia sac and hydrocele were dissected free from the spermatic cord. The spermatic cord dropped back posteriorly without any injury to the vessels or vas. The hernia sac was divided, dissected free from the vessels going up into the internal ring. There were no contents within it. It was twisted and suture ligated with an interrupted suture of 3-0 silk. The hydrocele was opened and around the testicle appendix testis was present, was cauterized at its base with good hemostasis. The testicle was replaced back into the scrotum and felt to be in good position, both at this time and at the end of the procedure. The incision was then closed in layers using 3-0 Vicryl for the external oblique aponeurosis and subcutaneous tissue, and a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips for the skin. 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine was instilled below the skin for postoperative pain relief and he had a caudal block placed by Anesthesia. He was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "The patient was put under general anesthesia and lay on their back. The area was cleaned and covered in the usual way. A horizontal cut was made across the crease of the groin skin and cut through the skin to the outer layer of the abdominal wall. The surgeon stopped bleeding with a cautery device and made sure not to damage the ilioinguinal nerve. The outer layer of the abdominal wall was found and a small cut was made along its fibers, then widened with scissors while avoiding nerves. The spermatic cord was freed from the edge of this outer layer and from nearby tissue. The hernia sac and fluid collection (hydrocele) were freed from the spermatic cord. The cord fell back behind the testicle without harming the blood vessels or vas deferens. The hernia sac was cut open, freed from the vessels that go up into the internal ring, and had no contents inside. It was twisted and tied off with a single stitch of 3‑0 silk. The hydrocele was opened and the appendix testis (a small appendix near the testicle) was cauterized at its base, stopping bleeding. The testicle was put back into the scrotum and felt to be in a good position, both during and after the surgery. The incision was closed in layers: the outer abdominal wall and the under‑skin tissue were stitched with 3‑0 Vicryl, the skin was closed with a running stitch of 4‑0 Vicryl and covered with Steri‑Strips. A small amount of 0.25% Marcaine (without epinephrine) was injected under the skin for pain relief after surgery, and the patient also had a caudal block from anesthesia. The patient was sent to recovery in stable condition."
