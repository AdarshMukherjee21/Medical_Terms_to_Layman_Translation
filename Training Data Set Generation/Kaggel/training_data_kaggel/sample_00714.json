  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE: Right inguinal hernia repair. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a right inguinal bulge, which comes and goes with Valsalva standing and some increased physical activity. He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair. We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia. All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right. The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy. Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia. Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution. During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure. I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision. An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block. A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique. After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated. The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained. Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed. I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective. I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl. The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced. The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated the operation well. Blood loss was less than 5 mL. The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition.",

A doctor in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic found a right inguinal hernia on exam. The boy’s parents were told about the surgery, the possible risks, and the idea of doing a small camera look at the other side to see if there was a hidden hernia. They asked questions, understood, and agreed to the plan.\n\n**What the surgeon found during the operation:**  \nThe right hernia sac was thin‑walled, which made it hard to put a small camera tube through it. Because of this, the surgeon decided to close the hernia by tying it off high up and did not do the camera look at the left side.\n\n**How the surgery was done:**  \nThe child was taken to the operating room and put under general anesthesia without any problems. A safety check was done to confirm the child’s name, record number, weight, allergies, and the planned surgery. The surgeon injected a local anesthetic (Marcaine with a little epinephrine) around the right groin area and deeper to block nerves that supply the area. A curved incision was made with a scalpel, and the layers of tissue were cut with cautery and scissors until the external oblique muscle was exposed. The surgeon lifted the spermatic cord and carefully separated the hernia sac from it. The sac was taken back to the deep inguinal ring. An attempt was made to insert a 3‑mm camera tube through the sac, but it was too thin and the surgeon feared tearing it. The camera approach was abandoned, and the sac was tied off high with a 3‑0 Vicryl suture. The extra sac was trimmed, and the cord was put back in place. The muscle and skin layers were closed with 3‑0 Vicryl stitches and a 5‑0 Monocryl subcuticular stitch, and Steri‑Strips were applied. The child tolerated the operation well, with less than 5 mL of blood loss. The hernia sac was sent to the lab, and the child was taken to recovery in good condition."
