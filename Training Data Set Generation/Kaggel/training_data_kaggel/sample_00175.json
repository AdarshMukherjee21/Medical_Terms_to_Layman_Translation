Foreign body, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Irrigation debridement. 2. Removal of foreign body of right foot. ANESTHESIA: Spinal with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. GROSS FINDINGS: Include purulent material from the abscess located in the plantar aspect of the foot between the third and fourth metatarsal heads. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The patient states that he was working in his garage over the past few days when he noticed some redness and edema in his right foot. He notes some itching as well as increasing pain and redness in the right foot and presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room. He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics. It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity. After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient. Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from. At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads. Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain. The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot. There was no obvious joint involvement. After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound. The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue. The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. DISPOSITION: The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement.",

He was working in his garage when he noticed redness, swelling, itching, and increasing pain in his right foot. He went to the emergency room at ABCD General Hospital. The ER staff and the orthopedic team examined him and found a foreign object in his foot on X‑ray, along with significant cellulitis in his right lower leg. After discussing the risks and benefits, the patient agreed to have the wound cleaned and the foreign object removed.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter explaining all possible complications, risks, and expected benefits, the patient gave informed consent. The surgical team confirmed the foot to be operated on. The patient was taken to the operating room, placed on his back, and all bony points were padded. Spinal anesthesia was given. The foot was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The surgeon saw a swollen, bruised area on the bottom of the foot with a small hole from which pus was draining. A 2‑centimeter long incision was made over this area, between the second and third metatarsal bones. Pus that smelled foul was released. Cultures and a gram stain were taken. The wound was explored and found to extend to the top of the foot, but no joint was involved. After breaking up all pockets of pus, 3 liters of antibiotic‑laden fluid were flushed through the wound. The wound was inspected again and no more pus or dead tissue was seen. It was packed with an iodoform gauze and covered with a sterile dressing (4×4 gauze, floss, and Kerlix) and an Ace bandage. Anesthesia was reversed, and the patient was moved to the recovery area. He tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.  \n\n**Disposition:**  \nThe patient will be monitored daily for the possibility of another irrigation and debridement if needed."
