  "medical": "EXAM: Cervical, lumbosacral, thoracic spine flexion and extension. HISTORY: Back and neck pain. CERVICAL SPINE FINDINGS: AP, lateral with flexion and extension, and both oblique projections of the cervical spine demonstrate alignment and soft tissue structures to be unremarkable. The vertebral bodies and the disc spaces appear normal. Oblique views demonstrate the intervertebral foramina to be of normal size and appearance. The odontoid view demonstrates the C1-2 structures to be in anatomical alignment. Additional flexion and extension views in the lateral position demonstrate normal physiologic movement with no evidence of subluxation or fixation. IMPRESSION: Negative cervical spine study including flexion-extension views. THORACIC SPINE FINDINGS: AP and lateral views of the thoracic spine, including a &quot;swimmer's&quot; projection for the upper thoracic spine, demonstrate satisfactory bony alignment. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc spaces. No fractures or loss of normal bony architecture is seen. No paravertebral masses are identified. IMPRESSION: Negative thoracic spine. LUMBAR SPINE FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the lumbar spine demonstrate satisfactory bony alignment with no fractures or loss of normal bony architecture. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc spaces. No paravertebral masses are evident. There is no fracture. IMPRESSION: Negative.",
  "layman": "EXAM: X‑rays of the neck, middle back, and lower back while bending forward and backward.  \nHISTORY: Back and neck pain.  \n\nCERVICAL (NECK) FINDINGS:  \nThe front, side, and angled X‑rays of the neck show normal alignment and soft tissues. The bone blocks (vertebrae) and the spaces between them look normal. The angled views confirm that the openings where nerves exit (intervertebral foramina) are normal. The view of the top two neck bones (C1‑C2) shows they are properly aligned. Extra side‑view X‑rays taken while bending show normal movement with no slipping or stuck joints.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Neck study is normal, including the bending views.  \n\nTHORACIC (MID‑BACK) FINDINGS:  \nFront and side X‑rays of the middle back, plus a special angled view for the upper part, show good bone alignment. The heights of the vertebrae and the spaces between them are preserved. No fractures or abnormal bone shape are seen. No abnormal masses next to the spine are found.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Middle back study is normal.  \n\nLUMBAR (LOWER BACK) FINDINGS:  \nFront and side X‑rays of the lower back show good bone alignment with no fractures or abnormal bone shape. The heights of the vertebrae and the spaces between them are preserved. No abnormal masses next to the spine are seen.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Lower back study is normal."
