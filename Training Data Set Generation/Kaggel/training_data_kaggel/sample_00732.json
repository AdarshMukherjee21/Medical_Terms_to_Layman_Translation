  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right hydronephrosis. 2. Right flank pain. 3. Atypical/dysplastic urine cytology. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right hydronephrosis. 2. Right flank pain. 3. Atypical/dysplastic urine cytology. 4. Extrarenal pelvis on the right. 5. No evidence of obstruction or ureteral/bladder lesions. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystoscopy. 2. Bilateral retrograde ureteropyelograms. 3. Right ureteral barbotage for urine cytology. 4. Right ureterorenoscopy, diagnostic. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY: Urine and saline wash barbotage from right ureter through the ureteral catheter. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 70-year-old female who reports progressive intermittent right flank pain associated with significant discomfort and disability. She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone. She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter. She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile. She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia. She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder. The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities. The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter. This was gently advanced to the mid ureter. Urine was collected for cytology. Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen. This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter. An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter. The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis. Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected. The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level. There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones. The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate. The ureteroscope was then removed. The cystoscope was reinserted. Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system. No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized. The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system. The cystoscope was removed. Foley catheter was inserted. The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",

Abnormal cells in the urine that may indicate early cancer.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses:**  \n1. Right kidney swelling.  \n2. Right flank pain.  \n3. Abnormal urine cells.  \n4. The right kidney’s pelvis is outside the kidney (extrarenal pelvis).  \n5. No blockage or tumors in the ureter or bladder.\n\n**Procedure performed:**  \n1. Cystoscopy (looking inside the bladder).  \n2. X‑ray images of both ureters from inside (retrograde ureteropyelograms).  \n3. Cleaning the right ureter with a saline wash to collect urine for testing.  \n4. Diagnostic scope of the right ureter and kidney (ureterorenoscopy).\n\n**Anesthesia:** Spinal.\n\n**Specimen sent to pathology:** Urine and saline wash from the right ureter.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:** Minimal.\n\n**Why the procedure was done:**  \nA 70‑year‑old woman had worsening pain on the right side of her back that made it hard to move. She went to the emergency room and was found to have a swollen right kidney but no stone. Her right ureter looked thickened. She also had tiny amounts of blood in her urine and abnormal cells that suggested early cancer. She was taken to surgery for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n**What happened during the operation:**  \nAfter talking with her and getting spinal anesthesia, the surgeon put her in a special position and cleaned the area. A 21‑French scope was inserted through the urethra into the bladder. The bladder looked normal. The opening of the right ureter was seen and a catheter was put in. The catheter was moved up to the middle of the ureter and urine was collected for testing. Saline was also injected through the catheter to help collect more urine, and that was sent for a combined test from the kidney’s pelvis and ureter.\n\nA guidewire was passed through the catheter. The catheter and scope were removed, and a flexible scope was threaded over the guidewire up to the kidney’s pelvis. With direct vision and X‑ray guidance, the surgeon looked at the whole pelvis and calyces. The pelvis was outside the kidney but there was no blockage at the top of the kidney. No stones were seen. The ureter had no visible tumors or narrowing after several passes of the scope. The scope was removed.\n\nThe scope was put back in. Saline was injected again through the catheter to confirm there was no leaking or abnormal anatomy. The left ureter was also examined and found normal. The scope was removed, a Foley catheter was placed, and the patient was moved to recovery in good condition."
