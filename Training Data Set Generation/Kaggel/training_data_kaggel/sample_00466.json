  "medical": "This is a middle-aged male with an epiglottic mass, odynophagia, and involvement of the left aryepiglottic fold, piriform sinus, and vallecula. High resolution transaxial images were obtained with reformatted sagittal and coronal images. FINDINGS: There is a lobulated mass lesion of the epiglottis measuring approximately 22 x 16 x 30 mm (mediolateral x AP x craniocaudal) in size. There is slightly greater involvement on the right side however there is bilateral involvement of the aryepiglottic folds. There is marked enlargement of the bilateral aryepiglottic folds (left greater than right). There is thickening of the glossoepiglottic fold. There is an infiltrative mass like lesion extending into the pre-epiglottic space. There is no demonstrated effacement of the piriform sinuses. The mass obliterates the right vallecula. The paraglottic spaces are normal. The true and false cords appear normal. Normal thyroid, cricoid and arytenoid cartilages. There is lobulated thickening of the right side of the tongue base, for which invasion of the tongue cannot be excluded. A MRI examination would be of benefit for further evaluation of this finding. There is a 14 x 5 x 12 mm node involving the left submental region (Level I). There is borderline enlargement of the bilateral jugulodigastric nodes (Level II). The left jugulodigastric node measures 14 x 11 x 8 mm while the right jugulodigastric node measures 15 x 12 x 8 mm. There is an enlarged second left high deep cervical node measuring 19 x 14 x 15 mm also consistent with a left Level II node, with a probable necrotic center. There is an enlarged second right high deep cervical node measuring 12 x 10 x 10 mm but no demonstrated central necrosis. There is an enlarged left mid level deep cervical node measuring 9 x 16 x 6 mm, located inferior to the hyoid bone but cephalad to the cricoid consistent with a Level III node. There are two enlarged matted nodes involving the right mid level deep cervical chain consistent with a right Level III nodal disease, producing a conglomerate nodal mass measuring approximately 26 x 12 x 10 mm. There is a left low level deep cervical node lying along the inferior edge of the cricoid cartilage measuring approximately 18 x 11 x 14 mm consistent with left Level IV nodal disease. There is no demonstrated pretracheal, prelaryngeal or superior mediastinal nodes. There is no demonstrated retropharyngeal adenopathy. There is thickening of the adenoidal pad without a mass lesion of the nasopharynx. The torus tubarius and fossa of Rosenmuller appear normal. IMPRESSION: Epiglottic mass lesion with probable invasion of the glossoepiglottic fold and pre-epiglottic space with invasion of the bilateral aryepiglottic folds. Lobulated tongue base for which tongue invasion cannot be excluded. An MRI may be of benefit for further assessment of this finding. Borderline enlargement of a submental node suggesting Level I adenopathy. Bilateral deep cervical nodal disease involving bilateral Level II, Level III and left Level IV.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged man who has a lump on his epiglottis (the flap that covers the windpipe when you swallow). He has pain when swallowing and the lump touches several nearby structures: the left aryepiglottic fold, the piriform sinus, and the vallecula.\n\nA high‑resolution CT scan was taken and reformatted into side‑view and front‑view images.  \n\n**Findings**\n\n- The epiglottis has a lobed mass about 22 mm wide, 16 mm front‑to‑back, and 30 mm tall.  \n- The mass is a little larger on the right side but both aryepiglottic folds are involved.  \n- Both aryepiglottic folds are noticeably swollen (the left more than the right).  \n- The glossoepiglottic fold is thickened.  \n- The mass extends into the space just in front of the epiglottis.  \n- The piriform sinuses are not narrowed.  \n- The mass blocks the right vallecula.  \n- The spaces next to the vocal cords (paraglottic spaces) look normal.  \n- The true and false vocal cords appear normal.  \n- The thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoid cartilages are normal.  \n- The right side of the tongue base shows a lobed thickening; it is unclear if the tongue itself is invaded. An MRI would help clarify this.  \n- A lymph node in the left submental area (Level I) measures 14 × 5 × 12 mm.  \n- Lymph nodes in both jugulodigastric areas (Level II) are slightly enlarged: left 14 × 11 × 8 mm, right 15 × 12 × 8 mm.  \n- A second left high deep cervical node (Level II) is 19 × 14 × 15 mm and may have a dead center.  \n- A second right high deep cervical node (Level II) is 12 × 10 × 10 mm with no dead center.  \n- A left mid‑level deep cervical node (Level III) is 9 × 16 × 6 mm, located below the hyoid bone but above the cricoid.  \n- Two right mid‑level deep cervical nodes (Level III) are matted together, forming a mass about 26 × 12 × 10 mm.  \n- A left low‑level deep cervical node (Level IV) along the lower edge of the cricoid measures 18 × 11 × 14 mm.  \n- No enlarged nodes are seen in the pretracheal, prelaryngeal, or upper mediastinal areas.  \n- No nodes are seen behind the pharynx (retropharyngeal).  \n- The adenoidal tissue is thickened, but there is no mass in the nasopharynx.  \n- The torus tubarius and fossa of Rosenmüller look normal.\n\n**Impression**\n\n- A mass on the epiglottis that probably invades the glossoepiglottic fold, the space in front of the epiglottis, and both aryepiglottic folds.  \n- The tongue base is lobed and tongue invasion cannot be ruled out; an MRI would help.  \n- A slightly enlarged node under the chin (Level I).  \n- Enlarged lymph nodes in both sides of the neck at Levels II, III, and left Level IV."
