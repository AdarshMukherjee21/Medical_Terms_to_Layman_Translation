  "medical": "CC: Found unresponsive. HX: 39 y/o RHF complained of a severe HA at 2AM 11/4/92. It was unclear whether she had been having HA prior to this. She took an unknown analgesic, then vomited, then lay down in bed with her husband. When her husband awoke at 8AM he found her unresponsive with &quot;stiff straight arms&quot; and a &quot;strange breathing pattern.&quot; A Brain CT scan revealed a large intracranial mass. She was intubated and hyperventilated to ABG (7.43/36/398). Other local lab values included: WBC 9.8, RBC 3.74, Hgb 13.8, Hct 40.7, Cr 0.5, BUN 8.5, Glucose 187, Na 140, K 4.0, Cl 107. She was given Mannitol 1gm/kg IV load, DPH 20mg/kg IV load, and transferred by helicopter to UIHC. PMH: 1)Myasthenia Gravis for 15 years, s/p Thymectomy MEDS: Imuran, Prednisone, Mestinon, Mannitol, DPH, IV NS FHX/SHX: Married. Tobacco 10 pack-year; quit nearly 10 years ago. ETOH/Substance Abuse unknown. EXAM: 35.8F, 99BPM, BP117/72, Mechanically ventilated at a rate of 22RPM on !00%FiO2. Unresponsive to verbal stimulation. CN: Pupils 7mm/5mm and unresponsive to light (fixed). No spontaneous eye movement or blink to threat. No papilledema or intraocular hemorrhage noted. Trace corneal reflexes bilaterally. No gag reflex. No oculocephalic reflex. MOTOR/SENSORY: No spontaneous movement. On noxious stimulation (Deep nail bed pressure) she either extended both upper extremities (RUE&gt;LUE), or withdrew the stimulated extremity (right &gt; left). Gait/Station/Coordination no tested. Reflexes: 1+ on right and 2+ on left with bilateral Babinski signs. HCT 11/4/92: Large heterogeneous mass in the right temporal-parietal region causing significant parenchymal distortion and leftward subfalcine effect . There is low parenchymal density within the white matter. A hyperdense ring lies peripherally and may represent hemorrhage or calcification. The mass demonstrates inhomogeneous enhancement with contrast. COURSE: Head of bed elevated to 30 degrees, Mannitol and DPH were continued. MRI of Brain demonstrated a large right parietal mass with necrotic appearing center and leftward shift of midline structures. She underwent surgical resection of the tumor. Pathological analysis was consistent with adenocarcinoma. GYN exam, CT Abdomen and Pelvis, Bone scan were unremarkable. CXR revealed an right upper lobe lung nodule. She did not undergo thoracic biopsy due to poor condition. She received 3000 cGy cranial XRT in ten fractions and following this was discharged to a rehabilitation center. In March, 1993 the patient exhibited right ptosis, poor adduction and abduction OD, 4/4 strength in the upper extremities and 5-/5- strength in the lower extremities. She was ambulatory with an ataxic gait. She was admitted on 7/12/93 for lower cervical and upper thoracic pain, paraparesis and T8 sensory level. MRI brainstem/spine on that day revealed decreased T1 signal in the C2, C3, C6 vertebral bodies, increased T2 signal in the anterior medulla, and tectum, and spinal cord (C7-T3). Following injection of Gadolinium there was diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement from C7-T7 These findings were felt consistent with metastatic disease including possible leptomeningeal spread. Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology agreed that the patients symptoms could be due to either radiation injury and/or metastasis. The patient was treated with Decadron and analgesics and discharged to a hospice center (her choice). She died a few months later.",
  "layman": "The patient was found unconscious. She was 39 years old and had a severe headache at 2 a.m. on November 4, 1992. She had taken an unknown pain pill, vomited, and lay in bed. Her husband woke at 8 a.m. and found her unresponsive, with stiff arms and an odd breathing pattern. A brain CT scan showed a large tumor. She was intubated and ventilated at a high rate. Blood tests were: WBC 9.8, RBC 3.74, Hgb 13.8, Hct 40.7, creatinine 0.5, BUN 8.5, glucose 187, sodium 140, potassium 4.0, chloride 107. She received mannitol (1 g/kg IV) and DPH (20 mg/kg IV) and was flown by helicopter to UIHC.\n\nPast medical history: 15‑year history of myasthenia gravis, had a thymectomy, and takes Imuran, prednisone, and Mestinon. She is married, smoked 10 pack‑years and quit about 10 years ago. Alcohol and drug use are unknown.\n\nPhysical exam: Temperature 35.8 °C, pulse 99 bpm, blood pressure 117/72 mm Hg. She was on a ventilator at 22 breaths/min with 100 % oxygen. She did not respond to voice. Pupils were 7 mm and 5 mm, fixed and did not react to light. No eye movement or blink to threat. No eye swelling or bleeding. Corneal reflexes were weak. No gag reflex or head‑turn reflex. No spontaneous movement. When pain was applied to the nail bed, she either extended both arms (right more than left) or withdrew the right arm more than the left. Reflexes were 1+ on the right, 2+ on the left, with Babinski signs on both sides.\n\nCT on 11/4/92: A large, mixed‑density tumor in the right temporal‑parietal area, pushing the brain to the left, with low density in the white matter. A ring around the tumor could be bleeding or calcification. The tumor showed uneven contrast uptake.\n\nCourse: The head of the bed was raised 30°, and mannitol and DPH were continued. MRI showed a large right parietal tumor with a dead center, shifting the brain. She had surgery to remove the tumor. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma. Gynecologic exam, abdominal/pelvic CT, and bone scan were normal. Chest X‑ray showed a nodule in the right upper lung, but no lung biopsy was done because she was too weak. She received 3000 cGy of brain radiation in ten sessions and was then sent to a rehabilitation center.\n\nIn March 1993 she had drooping of the right eyelid, poor eye movement, full strength in the arms, almost full strength in the legs, and could walk but with an unsteady gait. On July 12, 1993 she was admitted for neck and upper back pain, weakness in the legs, and loss of sensation at the T8 level. MRI of the brainstem and spine showed low T1 signal in the C2, C3, and C6 vertebrae, high T2 signal in the front of the medulla, tectum, and spinal cord from C7 to T3. After gadolinium, there was diffuse lining enhancement from C7 to T7. These findings suggested metastatic disease, possibly spreading along the lining. Neurosurgery and radiation oncology thought her symptoms could be from radiation injury or metastasis. She was treated with Decadron and pain medication and then discharged to a hospice of her choice. She died a few months later."
