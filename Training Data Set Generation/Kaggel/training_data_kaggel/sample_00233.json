  "medical": "RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: The arterial system was visualized showing triphasic waveform from the common femoral to popliteal and biphasic waveform at the posterior tibial artery with ankle brachial index of 0/8. LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: The arterial system was visualized with triphasic waveform from the common femoral to the popliteal artery, with biphasic waveform at the posterior tibial artery. Ankle brachial index of 0.9. IMPRESSION: Mild bilateral lower extremity arterial obstructive disease.",
  "layman": "Right leg: The arteries were seen with normal flow from the thigh to the knee, but the pattern changed in the lower leg artery. The ankle‑to‑arm pressure ratio was 0.8.  \n\nLeft leg: The arteries showed normal flow from the thigh to the knee, with a changed pattern in the lower leg artery. The ankle‑to‑arm pressure ratio was 0.9.  \n\nOverall: Mild blockage in the arteries of both legs."
