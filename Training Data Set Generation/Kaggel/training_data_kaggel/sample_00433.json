  "medical": "CC: Intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical, and torsional diplopia. HX: 70y/o RHM referred by Neuro-ophthalmology for evaluation of neuromuscular disease. In 7/91, he began experiencing intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical and torsional diplopia which was worse and frequent at the end of the day, and was eliminated when closing one either eye. An MRI Brain scan at that time was unremarkable. He was seen at UIHC Strabismus Clinic in 5/93 for these symptoms. On exam, he was found to have intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze, and consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze. This was felt to possibly represent Grave's disease. Thyroid function studies were unremarkable, but orbital echography suggested Graves orbitopathy. The patient was then seen in the Neuro-ophthalmology clinic on 12/23/92. His exam remained unchanged. He underwent Tensilon testing which was unremarkable. On 1/13/93, he was seen again in Neuro-ophthalmology. His exam remained relatively unchanged and repeat Tensilon testing was unremarkable. He then underwent a partial superior rectus resection, OD, with only mild improvement of his diplopia. During his 8/27/96 Neuro-ophthalmology clinic visit he was noted to have hypertropia OD with left pseudogaze palsy and a right ptosis. The ptosis improved upon administration of Tensilon and he was placed on Mestinon 30mg tid. His diplopia subsequently improved, but did not resolve. The dosage was increased to 60mg tid and his diplopia worsened and the dose decreased back to 30mg tid. At present he denied any fatigue on repetitive movement. He denied dysphagia, SOB, dysarthria, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or muscle atrophy. MEDS: Viokase, Probenecid, Mestinon 30mg tid. PMH: 1) Gastric ulcer 30 years ago, 2) Cholecystectomy, 3) Pancreatic insufficiency, 4) Gout, 5) Diplopia. FHX: Mother died age 89 of &quot;old age.&quot; Father died age 89 of stroke. Brother, age 74 with CAD, Sister died age 30 of cancer. SHX: Retired insurance salesman and denies history of tobacco or illicit drug us. He has no h/o ETOH abuse and does not drink at present. EXAM: BP 155/104. HR 92. RR 12. Temp 34.6C. WT 76.2kg. MS: Unremarkable. Normal speech with no dysarthria. CN: Right hypertropia (worse on rightward gaze and less on leftward gaze). Minimal to no ptosis, OD. No ptosis, OS. VFFTC. No complaint of diplopia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. SENSORY: No deficits appreciated on PP/VIB/LT/PROP/TEMP testing. Coordination/Station/Gait: Unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor on the right and withdrawal on the left. HEENT and GEN EXAM: Unremarkable. COURSE: EMG/NCV, 9/26/96: Repetitive stimulation studies of the median, facial, and spinal accessory nerves showed no evidence of decrement at baseline, and at intervals up to 3 minutes following exercise. The patient had been off Mestinon for 8 hours prior to testing. Chest CT with contrast, 9/26/96, revealed a 4x2.5x4cm centrally calcified soft tissue anterior mediastinal mass adjacent to the aortic arch. This was highly suggestive of a thymoma. There were diffuse emphysematous disease with scarring in the lung bases. A few nodules suggestive of granulomas and few calcified perihilar lymph nodes. He underwent thoracotomy and resection of the mass. Pathologic analysis was consistent with a thymoma, lymphocyte predominant type, with capsular and pleural invasion, and extension to the phrenic nerve resection margin. Acetylcholine Receptor-binding antibody titer 12.8nmol/L (normal&lt;0.7), Acetylcholine receptor blocking antibody &lt;10% (normal), Acetylcholine receptor modulating antibody 42% (normal&lt;19), Striated muscle antibody 1:320 (normal&lt;1:10). Striated muscle antibody titers tend to be elevated in myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma. He was subsequently treated with XRT and continued to complain of fatigue at his 4/18/97 Oncology visit.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nThe patient reports double vision that comes and goes in all directions (left‑right, up‑down, and twisting).  \n\n**History of Present Illness**  \n- 70‑year‑old right‑handed man.  \n- In July 1991 he first noticed intermittent double vision that got worse at the end of the day and disappeared when he closed one eye.  \n- An MRI of the brain at that time was normal.  \n- In May 1993 he was examined at a strabismus clinic. He had a right eye that was slightly higher than the left when looking straight ahead, and double vision when looking down or to the right. The doctors thought this might be related to Graves disease. Thyroid blood tests were normal, but an eye ultrasound suggested Graves eye disease.  \n- He was seen again in the neuro‑ophthalmology clinic in December 1992 and January 1993. His eye exam did not change, and a Tensilon test (used to look for myasthenia gravis) was normal.  \n- He had a partial removal of the right superior rectus muscle (a muscle that moves the eye upward). This helped a little but did not fix the double vision.  \n- In August 1996 he had a right eye that was higher, a left eye that had a “pseudo‑gaze palsy” (difficulty moving the left eye), and a drooping right eyelid. The drooping improved with a Tensilon injection, so he was started on Mestinon 30 mg three times a day. The double vision improved but did not disappear. When the dose was increased to 60 mg three times a day, the double vision got worse, so the dose was lowered back to 30 mg.  \n- He reports no fatigue when moving his eyes repeatedly. He denies trouble swallowing, shortness of breath, speech problems, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or muscle wasting.\n\n**Medications**  \n- Viokase (acetazolamide)  \n- Probenecid  \n- Mestinon 30 mg three times a day  \n\n**Past Medical History**  \n1. Gastric ulcer (30 years ago)  \n2. Gallbladder removal  \n3. Pancreatic insufficiency  \n4. Gout  \n5. Double vision  \n\n**Family History**  \n- Mother died at 89 of “old age.”  \n- Father died at 89 of stroke.  \n- Brother, 74, has coronary artery disease.  \n- Sister died at 30 of cancer.  \n\n**Social History**  \n- Retired insurance salesman.  \n- No tobacco or illegal drug use.  \n- No alcohol abuse; does not drink now.  \n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- Blood pressure 155/104 mm Hg, heart rate 92 bpm, breathing 12/min, temperature 34.6 °C (≈36.6 °C), weight 76.2 kg.  \n- General appearance normal.  \n- Speech normal, no slurred speech.  \n- Right eye higher than left, especially when looking to the right; less so when looking left. Minimal or no drooping of the right eyelid; none on the left. Visual fields normal. No current complaint of double vision.  \n- All other cranial nerves normal.  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 everywhere; muscle bulk and tone normal.  \n- Sensation normal to touch, vibration, light touch, pain, and temperature.  \n- Coordination, stance, and gait normal.  \n- Reflexes 2/2 throughout.  \n- Plantar responses: flexor on the right, withdrawal on the left.  \n- Head, ears, nose, throat, and general exam normal.  \n\n**Course of Investigation and Treatment**  \n- **EMG/NCV (Sept 26 1996)**: Repetitive nerve stimulation of the median, facial, and spinal accessory nerves showed no weakness at rest or after exercise. The patient had stopped Mestinon 8 hours before the test.  \n- **Chest CT with contrast (Sept 26 1996)**: A 4 × 2.5 × 4 cm calcified soft‑tissue mass was found in the front of the chest near the aortic arch, highly suggestive of a thymoma. There was also widespread emphysema with scarring in the lower lungs, a few nodules that looked like granulomas, and some calcified lymph nodes near the hilum.  \n- The patient had surgery (thoracotomy) to remove the mass. Pathology confirmed a thymoma of the lymphocyte‑predominant type, with invasion of the capsule and pleura and extension to the phrenic nerve margin.  \n- Blood tests for antibodies:  \n  - Acetylcholine receptor‑binding antibody 12.8 nmol/L (normal < 0.7)  \n  - Acetylcholine receptor‑blocking antibody < 10 % (normal)  \n  - Acetylcholine receptor‑modulating antibody 42 % (normal < 19 %)  \n  - Striated muscle antibody 1:320 (normal < 1:10)  \n  Elevated striated muscle antibodies are common in myasthenia gravis that is linked to thymoma.  \n- He received radiation therapy to the chest and still reported fatigue at his oncology visit on April 18 1997."
