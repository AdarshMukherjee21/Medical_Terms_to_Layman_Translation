  "layman": "**History of Present Illness:**  \nThe patient came in for a follow‑up visit after recently having an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). She was treated with Macrobid for 7 days and only took one dose of a nighttime preventive medicine. She stopped that medicine because it caused a skin rash and hives, which have since gone away. She has no pain when urinating, no visible blood in the urine, no fever or chills. She urinates every two to three hours during the day and once at night, has no leakage, and her stress urinary incontinence is getting better after pelvic rehab with Prometheus. A kidney ultrasound done on August 5, 2008 shows no swelling of the kidneys, no bladder mass, and no stones. Previous urine cultures (November 2007, May 7, 2008, and July 7, 2008) all grew E. coli. A catheterized urine sample was taken using a standard procedure, yielding 30 mL.  \n\n**Impression:**  \nThe patient has a recurrent UTI caused by E. coli. She finished the full course of antibiotics but stopped the preventive Macrobid because of hives, which have resolved.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nWe will send the urine for culture and sensitivity. If no infection is found, the patient will call the results on Monday and will be started on nighttime Keflex as a preventive measure. If an infection is found, she will follow up as previously scheduled for a diagnostic cystoscopy with Dr. X. All questions were answered."
