  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Iron deficiency anemia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis. PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. MEDICATIONS: MAC. PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon to the cecum identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. Preparation was good, although there was some residual material in the cecum that was difficult to clear completely. The mucosa was normal throughout the colon. No polyps or other lesions were identified, and no blood was noted. Some diverticula were seen of the sigmoid colon with no luminal narrowing or evidence of inflammation. A retroflex view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Diverticulosis in the sigmoid. 2. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Follow up with Dr. X as needed. 2. Screening colonoscopy in 2 years. 3. Additional evaluation for other causes of anemia may be appropriate.",

The scope was gently inserted through the rectum and moved all the way to the beginning of the large intestine (the cecum), which was identified by the ileocecal valve and the opening of the appendix. The bowel prep was good, but some leftover material in the cecum was hard to clear completely. The lining of the colon looked normal. No growths or other problems were seen, and there was no bleeding. Several small pouches (diverticula) were found in the sigmoid colon, but they were not narrowing the passage or showing signs of inflammation. A backward view of the area where the rectum meets the anus showed no hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery.  \n\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:  \n1. Diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon.  \n2. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum.  \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \n1. Follow up with Dr. X as needed.  \n2. Get a screening colonoscopy in 2 years.  \n3. Consider further tests to find other causes of anemia."
