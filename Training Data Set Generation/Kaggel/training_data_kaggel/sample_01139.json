  "medical": "EXAM: CT pelvis with contrast and ct abdomen with and without contrast. INDICATIONS: Abnormal liver enzymes and diarrhea. TECHNIQUE: CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after 100 mL of intravenous contrast administration and oral contrast administration. Pre-contrast images through the abdomen were also obtained. COMPARISON: There were no comparison studies. FINDINGS: The lung bases are clear. The liver demonstrates mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. These findings may be secondary to the patient's post cholecystectomy state. The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. There is a 13 mm peripheral-enhancing fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain etiology. There are numerous nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. These may be reactive; however, an early neoplastic process would be difficult to totally exclude. There is a right inguinal hernia containing a loop of small bowel. This may produce a partial obstruction as there is mild fluid distention of several small bowel loops, particularly in the right lower quadrant. The large bowel demonstrates significant diverticulosis coli of the sigmoid and distal descending colon without evidence of diverticulitis. There is diffuse osteopenia along with significant degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. The uterus is not visualized. IMPRESSION: 1. Right inguinal hernia containing small bowel. Partial obstruction is suspected. 2. Nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. 3. Thirteen millimeter of circumscribed fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain etiology. 4. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 5. Status post cholecystectomy with mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 6. Osteopenia and degenerative changes of the spine and pelvis.",
  "layman": "**Exam**: CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen, with and without contrast.  \n**Reason for the scan**: Abnormal liver enzymes and diarrhea.  \n\n**How it was done**: The scan was taken after giving 100 mL of contrast through a vein and also oral contrast. Images before contrast were also taken.  \n\n**No previous scans to compare**.  \n\n**What we saw**:  \n- The lower lungs look normal.  \n- The liver has a slight widening of the small bile ducts, probably because the gallbladder was removed.  \n- The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys look normal.  \n- There is a 13 mm fluid pocket near the front of the kidney area; we don’t know why it’s there.  \n- Many small lymph nodes are seen in the back and middle of the abdomen; they could be reacting to something, but we can’t rule out an early cancer.  \n- A right groin hernia contains a loop of small intestine, which may be blocking the bowel a little – several small bowel loops are mildly swollen with fluid, especially on the right side.  \n- The large intestine has many diverticula (pouches) in the sigmoid and lower descending colon, but no signs of inflammation.  \n- The bones show general bone loss and wear‑and‑tear changes in the lower back.  \n- The bladder looks normal. The uterus was not seen.  \n\n**Summary**:  \n1. Right groin hernia with small intestine, possibly causing partial blockage.  \n2. Small lymph nodes in the back and middle abdomen, cause unclear.  \n3. 13 mm fluid pocket near the front of the kidney area, cause unclear.  \n4. Diverticula in the colon, no inflammation.  \n5. After gallbladder removal, mild widening of liver bile ducts.  \n6. Bone loss and wear‑and‑tear changes in the spine and pelvis."
