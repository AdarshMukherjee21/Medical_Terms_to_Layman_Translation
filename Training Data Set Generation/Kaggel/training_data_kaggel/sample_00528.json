  "medical": "EXAM: Ultrasound examination of the scrotum. REASON FOR EXAM: Scrotal pain. FINDINGS: Duplex and color flow imaging as well as real time gray-scale imaging of the scrotum and testicles was performed. The left testicle measures 5.1 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm. There is no evidence of intratesticular masses. There is normal Doppler blood flow. The left epididymis has an unremarkable appearance. There is a trace hydrocele. The right testicle measures 5.3 x 2.4 x 3.2 cm. The epididymis has normal appearance. There is a trace hydrocele. No intratesticular masses or torsion is identified. There is no significant scrotal wall thickening. IMPRESSION: Trace bilateral hydroceles, which are nonspecific, otherwise unremarkable examination.",

No masses are seen inside it. Blood flow is normal. The left epididymis looks normal. There is a very small hydrocele (fluid).  \n- The right testicle is 5.3 × 2.4 × 3.2 cm. The epididymis looks normal. There is a very small hydrocele. No masses or torsion are seen.  \n- The scrotal wall is not thickened.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Small hydroceles on both sides, which are not specific, and otherwise everything looks normal."
