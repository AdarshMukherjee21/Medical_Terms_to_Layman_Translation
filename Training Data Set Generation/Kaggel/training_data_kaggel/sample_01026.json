  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is a 78-year-old right-handed inpatient with longstanding history of cervical spinal stenosis status post decompression, opioid dependence, who has had longstanding low back pain radiating into the right leg. She was undergoing a spinal epidural injection about a month ago and had worsening of right low back pain, which radiates down into her buttocks and down to posterior aspect of her thigh into her knee. This has required large amounts of opioid analgesics to control. She has been basically bedridden because of this. She was brought into hospital for further investigations. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, she has positive straight leg rising on the right with severe shooting, radicular type pain with right leg movement. Difficult to assess individual muscles, but strength is largely intact. Sensory examination is symmetric. Deep tendon reflexes reveal hyporeflexia in both patellae, which probably represents a cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression. She has slightly decreased right versus left ankle reflexes. The Babinski's are positive. On nerve conduction studies, motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in lower extremities. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It reveals the spontaneous activity in right peroneus longus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles as well as the right lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There is evidence of denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis muscle. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: 1. Inactive right S1 (L5) radiculopathy. 2. There is no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy or entrapment neuropathy. Results were discussed with the patient and she is scheduled for imaging studies in the next day.",
  "layman": "HISTORY: The patient is a 78‑year‑old right‑handed woman who has been in the hospital for a long time. She has cervical spinal stenosis that was treated with a decompression surgery, and she is dependent on opioids. She has had chronic low‑back pain that shoots into her right leg. About a month ago she had a spinal epidural injection, but her right‑side back pain got worse. The pain now goes down her buttocks, back of her thigh, and to her knee. She needs a lot of opioid pain medicine to keep it under control and has been mostly bedridden. She was admitted for further tests.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, a straight‑leg‑raise test on the right side was positive and caused severe shooting, nerve‑like pain when she moved her right leg. It was hard to test each muscle, but overall strength was mostly fine. Sensation was the same on both sides. Knee reflexes were weak on both sides, probably because of the earlier cervical spinal cord compression. The ankle reflex was a little weaker on the right than the left. The Babinski sign was positive. Nerve‑conduction studies of the legs were normal.\n\nNEEDLE EMG: A needle EMG was done on the right leg and lower back muscles. It showed abnormal spontaneous activity in the right peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and lower back muscles. There was evidence of muscle loss (denervation) in the right gastrocnemius medialis.\n\nIMPRESSION: The electrical study is abnormal. It shows:\n1. An inactive radiculopathy at the right S1 (L5) level.\n2. No radiculopathy, peripheral nerve damage, or nerve‑entrapment on the left leg.\n\nThe results were explained to the patient, and she is scheduled for imaging studies tomorrow."
