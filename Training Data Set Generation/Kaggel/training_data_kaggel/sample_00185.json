  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Arthroscopic debridement of the left shoulder with attempted arthroscopic Bankart repair followed by open Bankart arthroplasty of the left shoulder. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #2, administered general anesthetic after ineffective interscalene block had been administered in the preop area. The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest. The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel. His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest. The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula. The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock. The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule. The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area. The biceps tendon was noted to be intact. The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved. The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head. The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact. The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury. There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch. Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum. Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position. A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position. The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable. With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks. An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position. Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area. At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary. The arthroscopic instruments were removed. An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold. The skin incision was taken down through the skin. Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis. The deltopectoral fascia was identified. It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally. The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs. The conjoint tendon was identified. The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor. The subscapularis tendon was identified. It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later. The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially. This allowed for visualization of the capsule. The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair. It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position. This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint. The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified. The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock. The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely. At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated. The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture. This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture. This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry. The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips. 0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia. The patient was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.",

He was positioned in a modified beach‑chair style with a head support device. The left shoulder was propped back with a rolled towel and the head was secured. The shoulder and arm were cleaned and covered as usual. A small entry point was made on the back side of the shoulder for the arthroscopic tube. The camera was inserted into the shoulder joint. The front rim of the shoulder socket (the glenoid labrum) was completely torn from the top at about the 11:30 position down to the bottom at about 6:00. The torn labrum was stuck to the underlying capsule and the edge of the socket was frayed. The biceps tendon was intact. The inside of the socket was fairly well preserved. The upper arm bone (humerus) had a large dent (Hill‑Sachs lesion) on its back‑outer side. The rotator cuff muscles were intact. The space near the armpit (axillary pouch) was free of injury but had some cartilage fragments.  \n\nFirst, an entry point was made in the front of the shoulder to try to fix the torn labrum. Using a surgical tool through the front tube, the labrum was secured with a pin and drill, then pulled back to the top of the socket at about the 11 o’clock position. A second anchor was placed at about the 8 o’clock position. The labrum was checked and felt stable. When the shoulder was moved, the tissue pulled out of the anchors. A second attempt to place two more anchors failed because the tissue was not strong enough, so all anchors were either buried or removed. It was decided that an open repair was needed.  \n\nThe arthroscopic instruments were removed. A cut was made in the front of the shoulder, just lateral to the coracoid bone and down toward the armpit fold. The skin was cut through, and the tissue under the skin was separated with an electric cautery device to stop bleeding. The fascia covering the front of the shoulder was found and split. The deltoid muscle was moved to the side. The fluid sac under the deltoid was removed. The conjoint tendon was identified and the deltoid and conjoint tendons were held out of the way with a retractor. The subscapularis tendon was found, separated about a centimeter from its attachment, and moved aside to expose the capsule. The capsule was split near the humerus and then cut toward the socket at about the 9 o’clock position, exposing the joint. The torn labral and capsule tissue was seen. The socket was already prepared for sutures, so three small anchors were placed at about the 7, 9, and 10 o’clock positions. Sutures were passed through the labral and capsule tissue and tied securely, recreating the front rim of the socket.  \n\nThe joint was washed thoroughly with an antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. The capsule was stitched back to its attachment with absorbable stitches. The area was washed again. The subscapularis tendon was sewn back to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus with absorbable stitches, then washed. The deltoid fascia was closed with a running stitch. The tissue under the skin was closed with interrupted stitches and the skin was closed with a running stitch, followed by adhesive strips. A local anesthetic (Marcaine) was injected under the skin for pain relief. The patient was placed in a shoulder brace after a bulky dressing was applied. He was then moved to the recovery room in good condition."
