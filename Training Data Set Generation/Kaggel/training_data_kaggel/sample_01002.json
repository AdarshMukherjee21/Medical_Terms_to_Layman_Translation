  "medical": "HX: This 46y/o RHM with HTN was well until 2 weeks prior to exam when he experienced sudden onset dizziness and RUE clumsiness. The symptoms resolved within 10 min. He did well until the afternoon of admission when while moving the lawn he experienced lightheadedness, RUE dysfunction and expressive aphasia (could not get the words out). His wife took him to his local MD, and on the way there his symptoms resolved. His aphasia recurred at his physician's office and a CT scan of the brain revealed a left temporal mass. He was transferred to UIHC. PMH: HTN for many years MEDS: Vasotec and Dyazide SHX/FHX: ETOH abuse (quit '92), 30pk-yr Cigarettes (quit '92) EXAM: BP158/92, HR91, RR16 MS: Speech fluent without dysarthria CN: no deficits noted Motor: no weakness or abnormal tone noted Sensory: no deficits noted Coord: normal Station: no drift Gait ND Reflexes: 3+ throughout. Plantars down-going bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable STUDIES: WBC14.3K, Na 132, Cl 94, CO2 22, Glucose 129. CT Brain without contrast: Calcified 2.5 x 2.5cm mass arising from left sylvian fissure/temporal lobe. MRI Brain, 8/31/92: right temporo-parietal mass with mixed signal on T1 and T2 images. It has a peripheral dark rim on T1 and T2 with surrounding edema. This suggests a component of methemoglobin and hemosiderin within it. Slight peripheral enhancement was identified. There are two smaller foci of enhancement in the posterior parietal lobe on the right. There is nonspecific white matter foci within the pons and right thalamus. Impression: right temporoparietal hemorrhage, suggesting aneurysm or mass. The two smaller foci may suggest metastasis. The white matter changes probably reflect microvascular disease. 3 Vessel cerebroangiogram, 8/31/92: Lobulated fusiform aneurysm off a peripheral branch of the left middle cerebral artery with slow flow into the vessel distal to the aneurysm. COURSE: The aneurysm was felt to be inoperable and he was discharged home on Dilantin, ASA, and Diltiazem.",
  "layman": "**History**  \nA 46‑year‑old man with high blood pressure (HTN) was fine until two weeks before his exam. He suddenly felt dizzy and his right arm felt clumsy. The symptoms went away after about 10 minutes. He was okay until the afternoon of his hospital admission. While moving his lawn, he felt light‑headed, his right arm didn’t work well, and he had trouble speaking (couldn’t find the words). His wife took him to his local doctor. On the way, the symptoms went away, but they came back at the doctor’s office. A brain CT scan then showed a mass in the left temporal lobe. He was transferred to UIHC.\n\n**Past medical history** – HTN for many years.  \n**Medications** – Vasotec and Dyazide.  \n**Social history** – He used alcohol (quit in 1992) and smoked about 30 packs a year (quit in 1992).\n\n**Exam**  \n- Blood pressure 158/92, heart rate 91, breathing 16/min.  \n- Speech was fluent, no slurred speech.  \n- No facial or limb weakness, no abnormal muscle tone.  \n- No sensory loss.  \n- Coordination, balance, and walking were normal.  \n- Reflexes were a little brisk (3+).  \n- Plantar reflexes were normal (downward).  \n- General exam was normal.\n\n**Lab results**  \n- White blood cells 14.3K, sodium 132, chloride 94, CO₂ 22, glucose 129.\n\n**Imaging**  \n- **CT brain (no contrast)** – A calcified mass 2.5 × 2.5 cm in the left temporal lobe.  \n- **MRI brain (8/31/92)** – A right temporo‑parietal mass with mixed signals on T1 and T2, a dark rim around it, and swelling around it. This suggests blood breakdown products inside the mass. There was slight enhancement on the outside. Two smaller spots of enhancement were seen in the right posterior parietal lobe. Small white‑matter spots were seen in the pons and right thalamus.  \n  - **Interpretation** – A hemorrhage in the right temporo‑parietal area, possibly from an aneurysm or a tumor. The two small spots might be metastases. The white‑matter changes likely reflect small blood vessel disease.  \n- **3‑vessel cerebral angiogram (8/31/92)** – A lobulated, spindle‑shaped aneurysm on a small branch of the left middle cerebral artery with slow flow beyond the aneurysm.\n\n**Course**  \nThe aneurysm was considered inoperable. He was sent home on Dilantin, aspirin, and diltiazem."
