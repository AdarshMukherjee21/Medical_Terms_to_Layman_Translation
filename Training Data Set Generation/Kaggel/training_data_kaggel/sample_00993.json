  "medical": "EXAM: CT cervical spine. REASON FOR EXAM: MVA, feeling sleepy, headache, shoulder and rib pain. TECHNIQUE: Axial images through the cervical spine with coronal and sagittal reconstructions. FINDINGS: There is reversal of the normal cervical curvature at the vertebral body heights. The intervertebral disk spaces are otherwise maintained. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The facets are aligned. The tip of the clivus and occiput appear intact. On the coronal reconstructed sequence, there is satisfactory alignment of C1 on C2, no evidence of a base of dens fracture. The included portions of the first and second ribs are intact. There is no evidence of a posterior element fracture. Included portions of the mastoid air cells appear clear. There is no CT evidence of a moderate or high-grade stenosis. IMPRESSION: No acute process, cervical spine.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the neck bones.  \n**Reason for exam:** Car accident, feeling drowsy, headache, shoulder and rib pain.  \n**Technique:** Images taken from top to bottom of the neck with side‑by‑side and front‑to‑back views.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The normal gentle curve of the neck bones is reversed.  \n- The spaces between the bones (discs) are still there.  \n- No swelling of the soft tissues in front of the bones.  \n- The joint surfaces (facets) are lined up.  \n- The top part of the skull (clivus) and the back of the skull (occiput) look normal.  \n- In the side view, the first neck bone (C1) sits properly on the second (C2); no break at the base of the dens.  \n- The parts of the first and second ribs that were included in the scan are intact.  \n- No break in the back parts of the bones.  \n- The air cells in the mastoid area of the skull are clear.  \n- No narrowing of the spinal canal that would be moderate or severe.  \n\n**Impression:** No new or urgent problem in the cervical spine."
