  "medical": "REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Possible free air under the diaphragm. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 77-year-old female who is unable to give any information. She has been sedated with Ativan and came into the emergency room obtunded and unable to give any history. On a chest x-ray for what appeared to be shortness of breath she was found to have what was thought to be free air under the right diaphragm. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for alcohol abuse. Unable to really gather any other information because she is so obtunded. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Looking at the medical chart, she had an appendectomy, right hip fracture from a fall in 2005, and TAH/BSO. MEDICATIONS: Unable to evaluate. ALLERGIES: UNABLE TO EVALUATE. SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant history of alcohol abuse, according to the emergency room physician, who sees her on a regular basis. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to obtain. PHYSICAL EXAM VITAL SIGNS: Temp 98.3, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 24, and blood pressure 141/70. GENERAL: She is a very obtunded female who upon arousal is not able to provide any information of any use. HEENT: Atraumatic. NECK: Soft and supple. LUNGS: Bilaterally diminished. HEART: Regular. ABDOMEN: Soft, and with deep palpation I am unable to arouse the patient, unable to elicit any tenderness. LABORATORY STUDIES: Show a normal white blood cell count with no shift. Elevated AST at 138, with a normal ALT at 38. Alkaline phosphatase of 96, bilirubin 0.8. Sodium is 107, with 68 chloride and potassium of 2.8. X-ray of the chest shows the possibility of free air; therefore, a CT scan was obtained because of the patient's physical examination, which shows no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology. The etiology of the air under the diaphragm is actually a colonic air that is anterior superior to the dome of the diaphragm, near the dome of the liver. ASSESSMENT: No intra-abdominal pathology. PLAN: Have her admitted to the medical service for treatment of her hyponatremia.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the visit:** The doctor thinks there might be air under the diaphragm.\n\n**Current problem:** A 77‑year‑old woman was brought to the emergency room. She was very drowsy and could not give any information. She was given Ativan (a sedative) and was still very sleepy. A chest X‑ray taken because she seemed short of breath showed what looked like free air under the right side of the diaphragm.\n\n**Past medical history:** She has a history of alcohol abuse. Because she is so drowsy, we could not learn much more.\n\n**Past surgeries:** She had an appendectomy, a right hip fracture from a fall in 2005, and a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo‑oophorectomy (removal of uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes).\n\n**Medications:** We could not check her medications.\n\n**Allergies:** We could not check for allergies.\n\n**Social history:** The emergency doctor who sees her regularly says she has a significant history of alcohol abuse.\n\n**Review of systems:** We could not get any information.\n\n**Physical exam and vital signs:**  \n- Temperature: 98.3 °F  \n- Heart rate: 82 bpm  \n- Respiratory rate: 24 breaths/min  \n- Blood pressure: 141/70 mm Hg  \n\nThe woman is very drowsy and cannot give any useful information when she is awake.  \n- Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat: no obvious injury.  \n- Neck: soft and flexible.  \n- Lungs: breathing sounds are reduced on both sides.  \n- Heart: regular rhythm.  \n- Abdomen: soft; we could not feel any pain because she was still drowsy.\n\n**Lab results:**  \n- White blood cells: normal, no abnormal shift.  \n- AST (liver enzyme): 138 (high).  \n- ALT (liver enzyme): 38 (normal).  \n- Alkaline phosphatase: 96.  \n- Bilirubin: 0.8.  \n- Sodium: 107 (low).  \n- Chloride: 68.  \n- Potassium: 2.8 (low).  \n\nThe chest X‑ray suggested possible free air, so a CT scan was done. The CT showed no problems inside the abdomen. The air seen under the diaphragm was actually from the colon, located just above the diaphragm near the liver.\n\n**Assessment:** No problem inside the abdomen.\n\n**Plan:** Admit her to the medical service to treat her low sodium level."
