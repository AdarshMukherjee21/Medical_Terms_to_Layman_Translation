  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, this is a 17-year-old male, who has had problems with dysphagia to solids and recently had food impacted in the lower esophagus. He is now having upper endoscopy to evaluate the esophagus after edema and inflammation from the food impaction has resolved, to look for any stricture that may need to be dilated, or any other mucosal abnormality. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD. PREP: Cetacaine spray, 100 mcg of fentanyl IV, and 5 mg of Versed IV. FINDINGS: The tip of the endoscope was introduced into the esophagus, and the entire length of the esophagus was dotted with numerous, white, punctate lesions, suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. There were come concentric rings present. There was no erosion or flame hemorrhage, but there was some friability in the distal esophagus. Biopsies throughout the entire length of the esophagus from 25-40 cm were obtained to look for eosinophilic esophagitis. There was no stricture or Barrett mucosa. The bony and the antrum of the stomach are normal without any acute peptic lesions. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope in the body of the stomach revealed a normal cardia. There were no acute lesions and no evidence of ulcer, tumor, or polyp. The pylorus was easily entered, and the first, second, and third portions of the duodenum are normal. Adverse reactions: None. FINAL IMPRESSION: Esophageal changes suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. Biopsies throughout the length of the esophagus were obtained for microscopic analysis. There was no evidence of stricture, Barrett, or other abnormalities in the upper GI tract.",
  "layman": "**History of the problem**  \nA 17‑year‑old boy has trouble swallowing solid foods and recently had food stuck in the lower part of his esophagus. After the swelling and inflammation from that blockage went away, he had an upper endoscopy to check the esophagus for any narrowing that might need widening or other problems.\n\n**Procedure done**  \nAn upper endoscopy (EGD).  \nPreparation: Cetacaine spray, 100 mcg fentanyl IV, and 5 mg Versed IV.\n\n**What was seen**  \nThe scope was passed into the esophagus. The whole esophagus had many small white spots, which look like eosinophilic esophagitis. Some ring‑like patterns were also seen. There were no tears or bleeding, but the lower part of the esophagus was a bit fragile. Biopsies were taken from 25–40 cm along the esophagus to confirm eosinophilic esophagitis. No narrowing or Barrett’s changes were found.  \nThe stomach and its antrum looked normal, with no acute ulcers. Looking back into the stomach showed a normal cardia. No ulcers, tumors, or polyps were seen. The pylorus was easy to pass, and the first, second, and third parts of the duodenum were normal.\n\n**Side effects**  \nNone.\n\n**Final impression**  \nThe esophagus shows changes that suggest eosinophilic esophagitis. Biopsies were taken for microscopic review. No narrowing, Barrett’s, or other upper GI abnormalities were found."
