  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6, with spinal stenosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6, with spinal stenosis. PROCEDURE: Anterior cervical discectomy with fusion C5-C6. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An incision was made from midline to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid in the right side. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply. Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. Carotid sheath was retracted laterally. Longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C5-C6. We confirmed our position by taking intraoperative x-rays. We then used the operating microscope and cleaned out the disk completely. We then sized the interspace and then tapped in a #7 mm cortical cancellous graft. We then used the DePuy Dynamic plate with 14-mm screws. Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for muscle and fascia. The blood loss was less than 10-20 mL. No complication. Needle count, sponge count, and cottonoid count was correct.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: A herniated disc at the C5‑C6 level of the neck that is narrowing the spinal canal.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as before – a herniated disc at C5‑C6 with spinal canal narrowing.  \n\nPROCEDURE: Surgery to remove the damaged disc and fuse the C5‑C6 vertebrae.  \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nThe patient lay on their back. The neck was cleaned and covered in the usual way. A cut was made from the middle of the neck to the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side. The skin and tissue under it were cut cleanly. The windpipe (trachea) and food pipe (esophagus) were moved toward the middle of the neck. The carotid sheath, which contains the carotid artery, was moved to the side. The longus colli muscles were pulled away from the C5‑C6 vertebrae. We checked our position with X‑ray images taken during the operation. Using a surgical microscope, we removed the damaged disc completely. We measured the space between the vertebrae and inserted a #7 mm bone graft made of cortical and cancellous bone. A DePuy Dynamic plate with 14‑mm screws was attached. A Jackson‑Pratt drain was placed in the space in front of the vertebrae and brought out through a separate small cut. The wound was closed in layers, using 2‑0 Vicryl sutures for the muscle and fascia. Blood loss was less than 10‑20 mL. No complications occurred. All needles, sponges, and cottonoids were counted correctly."
