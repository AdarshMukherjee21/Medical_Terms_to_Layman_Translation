  "medical": "CC: Bilateral lower extremity numbness. HX: 21 y/o RHM complained of gradual onset numbness and incoordination of both lower extremities beginning approximately 11/5/96. The symptoms became maximal over a 12-24 hour period and have not changed since. The symptoms consist of tingling in the distal lower extremities approximately half way up the calf bilaterally. He noted decreased coordination of both lower extremities which he thought might be due to uncertainty as to where his feet were being placed in space. He denied bowel/bladder problems, or weakness or numbness elsewhere. Hot showers may improve his symptoms. He has suffered no recent flu-like illness. Past medical and family histories are unremarkable. He was on no medications. EXAM: Unremarkable except for mild distal vibratory sensation loss in the toes (R&gt;L). LAB: CBC, Gen Screen, TSH, FT4, SPE, ANA were all WNL. MRI L-SPINE: Normal. COURSE: Normal exam and diminished symptoms at following visit 4/23/93.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: numbness in both legs.  \nHistory: A 21‑year‑old man noticed a gradual onset of numbness and trouble moving both legs that began on November 5, 1996. The symptoms reached their worst within 12–24 hours and have stayed the same since. He feels tingling halfway up each calf and has trouble coordinating his steps, as if he can’t tell where his feet are. He has no bowel or bladder problems, no weakness or numbness elsewhere, and no recent flu‑like illness. Hot showers seem to help. He has no other medical problems, no family history of similar issues, and is not taking any medications.  \n\nPhysical exam: normal except for a slight loss of vibration sense in the toes, more on the right side than the left.  \n\nLaboratory tests: complete blood count, general screen, thyroid‑stimulating hormone, free T4, serum protein electrophoresis, and ANA were all within normal limits.  \n\nMRI of the lumbar spine: normal.  \n\nCourse: At a follow‑up visit on April 23, 1993, the exam was normal and his symptoms had lessened."
