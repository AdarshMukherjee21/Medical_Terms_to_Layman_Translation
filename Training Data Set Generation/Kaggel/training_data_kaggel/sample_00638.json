  "medical": "EXAM: Single frontal view of the chest. HISTORY: Atelectasis. Patient is status-post surgical correction for ASD. TECHNIQUE: A single frontal view of the chest was evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated mm/dd/yy. FINDINGS: Current film reveals there is a right-sided central venous catheter, the distal tip appears to be in the superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube with the distal tip appears to be in appropriate position, approximately 2 cm superior to the carina. Sternotomy wires are noted. They appear in appropriate placement. There are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Once again seen is minimal amount of bilateral basilar atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears to be within normal limits at this time. No evidence of any pneumothoraces or pleural effusions. IMPRESSION: 1. There has been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and sternotomy wires secondary to patient's most recent surgical intervention. 2. Minimal bilateral basilar atelectasis with no significant interval changes from the patient's most recent prior. 3. Interval decrease in the patient's heart size which may be secondary to the surgery versus positional and technique.",
  "layman": "EXAM: One front‑view chest X‑ray.  \nHISTORY: The patient has collapsed lung tissue (atelectasis) and has had surgery to fix an atrial septal defect (ASD).  \n\nTECHNIQUE: The front‑view X‑ray was taken and compared with the previous film from mm/dd/yy.  \n\nFINDINGS: The new X‑ray shows a right‑sided central venous catheter, with its tip in the superior vena cava. An endotracheal tube is in the correct place, about 2 cm above the carina. Sternotomy wires are present and look properly positioned. There are no areas of lung consolidation that would suggest pneumonia. There is a small amount of collapsed lung at the bases of both lungs, which is the same as on the prior X‑ray. The heart and mediastinum look normal. There are no signs of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) or fluid in the pleural space.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. A right‑sided central venous catheter, an endotracheal tube, and sternotomy wires were added during the patient’s recent surgery.  \n2. Minimal collapsed lung at the bases of both lungs, unchanged from the last X‑ray.  \n3. The heart appears slightly smaller now, which may be due to the surgery, the patient’s position, or the way the X‑ray was taken."
