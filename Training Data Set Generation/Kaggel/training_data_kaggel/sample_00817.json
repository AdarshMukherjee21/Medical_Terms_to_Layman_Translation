  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance. He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo. He just describes as feeling very lightheaded. It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position. It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over. Lorazepam did not help this sensation. His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased. They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Detailed on our H&P form. Positive for elevated cholesterol, diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, hypertension, heart disease, vertigo, stroke in May of 2005, congestive heart failure, CABG, and cataract removed right eye. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Detailed on the H&P form. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His blood pressure sitting down was 180/80 with a pulse rate of 56. Standing up blood pressure was 160/80 with a pulse rate of 56. His general exam and neurological exam were detailed on our H&P form. Pertinent positives on his neurological exam were decreased sensation in his left face, and left arm and leg. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: This lightheaded, he exquisitely denies vertigo, the vertigo that he has had in the past. He states this is more of a lightheaded type feeling. He did have a mild blood pressure drop here in the office. We are also concerned that bradycardia might be contributing to his feeling of lightheadedness. We are going to suggest that he gets a Holter monitor and he should speak to his general practitioner as well as his cardiologist regarding the lightheaded feeling. We will schedule him for the Holter monitor and refer him back to his cardiologist.",
  "layman": "**History of Present Illness**  \nThe patient came in today because he feels lightheaded and has trouble keeping his balance. He says it is not the spinning feeling he has had before with vertigo; it is just a strong sense of lightheadedness. It usually happens when he changes position, such as standing up from sitting or lying down. Sitting down again helps a little, but the feeling can last 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over. Lorazepam did not help. His blood pressure has been high lately, and his metoprolol dose was increased. He thinks the symptoms have gotten worse since the dose was raised.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \n(See our H&P form.) The patient has high cholesterol, diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, high blood pressure, heart disease, a history of vertigo, a stroke in May 2005, congestive heart failure, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and a cataract removed from his right eye.\n\n**Current Medications**  \n(See our H&P form.)\n\n**Physical Examination**  \nBlood pressure while sitting: 180/80, pulse 56. Blood pressure while standing: 160/80, pulse 56. General and neurological exams are on the H&P form. Notable findings on the neurological exam include decreased sensation on the left side of his face, left arm, and left leg.\n\n**Impression and Plan**  \nThe patient’s lightheadedness is not the same as his past vertigo; it is more of a general lightheaded feeling. He had a mild drop in blood pressure during the visit. We are also concerned that a slow heart rate (bradycardia) might be contributing to his lightheadedness. We will arrange for a Holter monitor and advise him to discuss the symptoms with his primary doctor and cardiologist. The Holter monitor will be scheduled, and he will be referred back to his cardiologist."
