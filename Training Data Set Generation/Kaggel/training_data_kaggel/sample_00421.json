  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Include inflamed, non-perforated appendix. OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was seen by me in the preoperative holding area. The risks of the procedure were explained. She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery. General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted. The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion. A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope. Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum. A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region. The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized. The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated. I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix. The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty. I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty. I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty. I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry. One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line. We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites. The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture. The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture. Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied. No complications. Minimal blood loss. Specimen is the appendix. Brought to the recovery room in stable condition.",

She was taken to the operating room and given antibiotics before the surgery. General anesthesia was given without any problems and a urinary catheter was inserted. Her left arm was tucked and her belly was cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nA small (5‑mm) incision was made just below the belly button and a 5‑mm camera was put in. We filled the belly with CO₂ to create space for the surgery. Another 5‑mm incision was made in the lower left side of the belly and a larger (12‑mm) incision was made just above the pubic bone. The camera was moved to the belly‑button incision and we could see the appendix easily. The base of the cecum (the part of the intestine next to the appendix) was swollen but not broken.  \n\nI grasped the tissue that supplies the appendix (the mesoappendix) and made a small opening between the base of that tissue and the base of the appendix. I passed a stapling device (Endo GIA blue cartridge) through that opening and fired it to cut and seal the base of the mesoappendix. I then used a red cartridge to cut the rest of the mesoappendix. The appendix was placed in a bag (Endobag) and removed through the upper incision. I re‑inserted the upper incision, washed the lower right side of the belly until it was dry, and checked that there was no bleeding from the staples.  \n\nAll the incisions were removed while watching them directly. The belly was deflated and the upper incision was closed with a 0‑Vicryl stitch. The skin was numbed with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with a 4‑0 Monocryl stitch. Steri‑strips and sterile dressings were applied. There were no complications and only a small amount of blood loss. The removed tissue was the appendix. The patient was taken to recovery in stable condition."
