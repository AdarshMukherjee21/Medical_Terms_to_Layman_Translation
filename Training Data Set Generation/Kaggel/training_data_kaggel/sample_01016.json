  "medical": "CC: BLE weakness and numbness. HX: This 59 y/o RHM was seen and released from an ER 1 week prior to this presentation for a 3 week history of progressive sensory and motor deficits in both lower extremities. He reported numbness beginning about his trunk and slowly progressing to involve his lower extremities over a 4 week period. On presentation, he felt numb from the nipple line down.

He started using a cane 5 days before being seen and had been having difficulty walking and traversing stairs. He claimed he could not stand. He denied loss of bowel or bladder control. However, he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days and he had not urinated 24 hours. His lower extremities had been feeling cold for a day. He denied any associated back or neck pain. He has chronic shortness of breath, but felt it had become worse. He had also been experiencing lightheadedness upon standing more readily than usual for 2 days prior to presentation.

MEDS: Benadryl, ECASA, Diltiazem, Isordil, Enalapril, Indomethacin, Terbutaline MDI, Ipratropium MDI, Folic Acid, Thiamine. SHX: 120pk-yr smoking, ETOH abuse in past, Retired Dock Hand FHX: unremarkable except for ETOH abuse EXAM: T98.2 96bpm 140/74mmHg R18 Thin cachetic male in moderate distress. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was fluent and without dysarthria. Comprehension, naming and reading were intact. CN: unremarkable. Motor: Full strength in both upper extremities. HF HE HAdd HAbd KF KE AF AE RLE 3 3 4 4 3 4 1 1 LLE 4 4 4+ 4+ 4+ 4 4 4 There was mild spastic muscle tone in the lower extremities. There was normal muscle bulk throughout. SENSORY: Decreased PP in the LLE from the foot to nipple line, and in the RLE from the knee to nipple line. Decreased Temperature sensation from the feet to the umbilicus, bilaterally. No loss of Vibration or Proprioception. Decreased light touch from the feet to nipple line, bilaterally. Gait: unable to walk. Stands with support only. Station: no pronator drift or truncal ataxia. Reflexes: 2+/2+ in BUE, 3+/3+ patellae, 0/1 ankles. Babinski signs were present, bilaterally. The abdominal reflexes were absent. CV: RRR with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. Lungs: CTA with mildly labored breathing. Abdomen: NT, ND, NBS, but bladder distended. Extremities were cool to touch. Peripheral pulses were intact and capillary refill was brisk. Rectal: decreased rectal tone and absent anal reflex. Right prostate nodule at the inferior pole. COURSE: Admission Labs: FEV1=1.17, FVC 2.19, ABG 7.39/42/79 on room air. WBC 10/5, Hgb 13, Hct 39, Electrolytes were normal. PT & PTT were normal. Straight catheterization revealed a residual volume of 400cc of urine. He underwent emergent T-spine MRI. This revealed a T3-4 vertebral body lesion which had invaded the spinal canal was compressing the spinal cord. He was treated with Decadron and underwent emergent spinal cord decompression on 5/7/95. He recovered some lower extremity strength following surgery. Pathological analysis of the tumor was consistent with adenocarcinoma. His primary tumor was not located despite chest-abdominal-pelvic CT scans, and a GI and GU workup which included cystoscopy and endoscopy. He received 3000cGy of XRT and died 5 months after presentation.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:**  \nWeakness and numbness in the legs.\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nA 59‑year‑old man with a history of heart disease and lung problems was taken to the emergency room a week ago because he had been getting numb and weak in both legs for three weeks.

Coronary artery disease with chronic chest pain  \n2. Non‑Q‑wave myocardial infarction in 1994, treated with coronary angioplasty  \n3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (previous lung function tests: FEV1 11.48, FVC 2.13)  \n4. Anxiety disorder  \n5. Degenerative joint disease  \n6. Confusion while taking metoprolol  \n7. High blood pressure  \n\n**Medications:**  \nBenadryl, ECASA, diltiazem, Isordil, enalapril, indomethacin, terbutaline inhaler, ipratropium inhaler, folic acid, thiamine.\n\n**Social History:**  \nSmoked 120 pack‑years, used alcohol in the past, retired dock worker.\n\n**Family History:**  \nUnremarkable except for alcohol abuse.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- Temperature 98.2°F, pulse 96, blood pressure 140/74 mmHg.  \n- Thin, cachectic male in moderate distress.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  \n- Speech clear, no slurred words.  \n- Can understand, name, and read normally.  \n- Cranial nerves normal.  \n- Upper‑arm strength normal.  \n- Lower‑leg strength: right leg 3/5, left leg 4/5.  \n- Mild stiffness in lower legs, normal muscle bulk.  \n- Sensation: decreased pain and light touch from the feet up to the nipple line on both legs; decreased temperature sensation from the feet to the belly button on both legs. No loss of vibration or joint position sense.  \n- Gait: cannot walk, can only stand with support.  \n- Reflexes: normal in arms, slightly high in knees, low in ankles. Babinski sign present on both feet.  \n- Abdominal reflexes absent.  \n- Heart: regular rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at left sternal border.  \n- Lungs: clear but breathing a little harder than usual.  \n- Abdomen: normal, bladder feels full.  \n- Legs cool to touch. Pulses normal, capillary refill quick.  \n- Rectal exam: low tone, no anal reflex. Right prostate nodule noted.\n\n**Course and Investigations:**  \n- Admitted for labs: FEV1 1.17, FVC 2.19, ABG 7.39/42/79 on room air. White blood cells 10.5, hemoglobin 13, hematocrit 39. Electrolytes, clotting times normal.  \n- Catheterization showed 400 cc of urine left in the bladder.  \n- Emergency MRI of the thoracic spine showed a lesion at T3‑T4 that had invaded the spinal canal and was pressing on the spinal cord.  \n- He was given steroids (Decadron) and had emergency surgery to relieve pressure on the spinal cord on May 7, 1995.  \n- After surgery he regained some leg strength.  \n- Pathology showed the tumor was adenocarcinoma.  \n- A full body CT scan and GI/GU work‑ups (cystoscopy, endoscopy) did not find the primary cancer.  \n- He received 3000 cGy of radiation therapy.  \n- He died five months after the initial presentation."
