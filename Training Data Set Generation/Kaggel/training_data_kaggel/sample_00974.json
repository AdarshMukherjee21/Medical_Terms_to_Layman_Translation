Intraarticular loose bodies. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopy of the left knee was performed with the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. 2. Removal of loose bodies. 3. Medial femoral chondroplasty. 4. Medial meniscoplasty. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed in supine position, and administered a general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia. Following this, the knee was sterilely prepped and draped as discussed for this procedure. The inferolateral and inferomedial portals were then established; however, prior to this, a graft was harvested from the semitendinosus and gracilis region. After the notch was identified, then ACL was confirmed and ruptured. There was noted to be a torn, slipped up area of the medial meniscus, which was impinging and impinged on the articular surface. The snare was smoothed out. Entire area was thoroughly irrigated. Following this, there was noted in fact to be significant degenerative changes from this impingement of the meniscus again to the periarticular cartilage. The areas of the worn away portion of the medial femoral condyle was then debrided and ________ chondroplasty was then performed of this area in order to stimulate bleeding and healing. There were multiple loose bodies noted in the knee and these were then __________ and then removed. The tibial and femoral drill holes were then established and the graft was then put in place, both which locations after a notchplasty was performed. The knee was taken through a full range of motion without any impingement. An Endobutton was used for proximal fixation. Distal fixation was obtained with an independent screw and a staple. The patient was then taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit at the conclusion of the procedure.",

Tear in the inner (medial) meniscus.  \n3. Damage to the cartilage on the inner side of the femur (medial femoral chondromalacia).  \n4. Loose pieces of tissue inside the joint.\n\n**PROCEDURE PERFORMED**  \n1. Arthroscopy of the left knee with ACL reconstruction.  \n2. Removal of loose pieces inside the joint.  \n3. Treatment of the damaged cartilage on the inner side of the femur (chondroplasty).  \n4. Repair of the inner meniscus (meniscoplasty).\n\n**OPERATIVE PROCEDURE**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, laid on their back, and given general anesthesia. The knee was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Two small entry points (inferolateral and inferomedial portals) were made. Before that, a graft was taken from the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons in the thigh. The surgeon found the ACL and confirmed it was torn. A tear in the inner meniscus was seen, and it was pressing against the joint surface. The area was cleaned with fluid. The meniscus tear had caused wear on the cartilage around the joint. The worn part of the inner femur was shaved and treated with chondroplasty to encourage healing. Several loose pieces of tissue were found and removed. Drill holes were made in the tibia and femur, and the graft was placed through these holes. A notchplasty (shaving of the notch) was also done. The knee was moved through its full range of motion and felt smooth. An Endobutton was used to hold the graft at the top, and a screw and staple were used to secure it at the bottom. The patient was then taken to the recovery area."
