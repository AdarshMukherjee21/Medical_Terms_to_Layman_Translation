  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Voluntary sterility. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Voluntary sterility. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Bilateral vasectomy. ANESTHESIA: Local. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A gentleman who is here today requesting voluntary sterility. Options were discussed for voluntary sterility and he has elected to proceed with a bilateral vasectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, and after appropriately identifying the patient, the patient was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion and placed in a supine position on the OR table. Then, 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine was used to anesthetize the scrotal skin. A small incision was made in the right hemiscrotum. The vas deferens was grasped with a vas clamp. Next, the vas deferens was skeletonized. It was clipped proximally and distally twice. The cut edges were fulgurated. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained. Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin on the right hemiscrotum. Next, the attention was turned to the left hemiscrotum, and after the left hemiscrotum was anesthetized appropriately, a small incision was made in the left hemiscrotum. The vas deferens was isolated. It was skeletonized. It was clipped proximally and distally twice. The cut edges were fulgurated. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained. Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin. A jockstrap and sterile dressing were applied at the end of the case. Sponge, needle, and instruments counts were correct.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Voluntary sterility.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Voluntary sterility.  \n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Bilateral vasectomy.  \nANESTHESIA: Local.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A man who has chosen to become permanently sterile. He was given information about all options and decided to have a bilateral vasectomy.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, identified, and prepared in the usual surgical way. He lay on his back on the operating table. Local anesthesia (0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine) was injected into the scrotal skin.  \n\nA small cut was made in the right side of the scrotum. The surgeon used a clamp to hold the vas deferens (the tube that carries sperm). The tube was cleared of surrounding tissue, then two clips were placed near the cut on each side. The cut ends were cauterized (burned) to stop bleeding. The area was carefully checked for bleeding. The skin was closed with 4‑0 chromic sutures.  \n\nThe same steps were repeated on the left side: the left scrotum was anesthetized, a small incision was made, the vas deferens was isolated and cleared, clipped twice, cauterized, and the skin closed with 4‑0 chromic sutures.  \n\nAfter the surgery, a jockstrap and sterile dressing were applied. All sponges, needles, and instruments were counted and accounted for."
