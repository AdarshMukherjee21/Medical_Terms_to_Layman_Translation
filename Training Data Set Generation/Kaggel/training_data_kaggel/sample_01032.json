  "medical": "EXAM: AP abdomen and ultrasound of kidney. HISTORY: Ureteral stricture. AP ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Comparison is made to study from Month DD, YYYY. There is a left lower quadrant ostomy. There are no dilated bowel loops suggesting obstruction. There is a double-J right ureteral stent, which appears in place. There are several pelvic calcifications, which are likely vascular. No definite pathologic calcifications are seen overlying the regions of the kidneys or obstructing course of the ureters. Overall findings are stable versus most recent exam. IMPRESSION: Properly positioned double-J right ureteral stent. No evidence for calcified renal or ureteral stones. ULTRASOUND KIDNEYS FINDINGS: The right kidney is normal in cortical echogenicity of solid mass, stone, hydronephrosis measuring 9.0 x 2.9 x 4.3 cm. There is a right renal/ureteral stent identified. There is no perinephric fluid collection. The left kidney demonstrates moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis. No stone or solid masses seen. The cortex is normal. The bladder is decompressed. IMPRESSION: 1. Left-sided hydronephrosis. 2. No visible renal or ureteral calculi. 3. Right ureteral stent.",

No kidney or ureter stones are seen.  \n\nKIDNEY ULTRASOUND FINDINGS:  \n- The right kidney looks normal; no solid mass, stone, or swelling (hydronephrosis) measuring 9.0 × 2.9 × 4.3 cm.  \n- The right stent is present.  \n- No fluid around the kidney.  \n- The left kidney shows moderate‑to‑severe swelling (hydronephrosis). No stone or mass is seen.  \n- The kidney tissue (cortex) looks normal.  \n- The bladder is empty.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Swelling of the left kidney.  \n2. No visible stones in the kidneys or ureters.  \n3. Right ureteral stent is present."
