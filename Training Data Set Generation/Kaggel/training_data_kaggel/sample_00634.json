  "medical": "ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. HISTORY: The patient is a 71-year-old male whose personal physician, Dr. X identified a change in the patient's PSA from 7/2008 (4.2) to 4/2009 (10.5). The patient underwent a transrectal ultrasound and biopsy and was found to have a Gleason 3+4 for a score of 7, 20% of the tissue removed from the left base. The patient also had Gleason 6 in the right lobe, midportion, as well as the left apical portion. He underwent a bone scan which was normal and cystoscopy which was normal and renal ultrasound that was normal. SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy. MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation. MEDICATIONS: Coumadin and lisinopril. SOCIAL HISTORY: Smokes none. Alcohol none. ALLERGIES: NONE. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient relates no recent weight gain, weight loss, night sweats, fevers or chills. Eyes: No change in vision or diplopia. Ears: No tinnitus or vertigo. Mouth: No dysphagia. Pulmonary: No chronic cough or shortness of breath. Cardiac: No angina or palpitations. GI: No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. Musculoskeletal: No arthritides or myalgias. Hematopoietic: No easy bleeding or bruising. Skin: No chronic ulcers or persistent itch. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is well developed and well nourished. HEENT: Head is normocephalic. Eyes, pupils are equal. Conjunctivae are pink. Sclerae are anicteric. NECK: There is no adenopathy. PULMONARY: Respirations are unlabored. HEART: Regular rhythm. ABDOMEN: Liver, spleen, kidney, and bladder are not palpable. There are no discernible masses. There are no peritoneal signs. GENITALIA: The penis has no plaques. Meatus is on the glans. Scrotal skin is healthy. Testicles are fair consistency. Epididymides are nontender. RECTAL: The prostate is +1 to 2/4. There are no areas that are suspicious for tumor. Consistency is even. Sidewalls are sharp. Seminal vesicles are not palpable. MUSCULOSKELETAL: The upper and lower extremities are symmetric bilaterally. NEUROLOGIC: There are no gross focal neurologic abnormalities. IMPRESSION: 1. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 2. Atrial fibrillation. PLAN: The patient's wife and I have discussed his treatment options, which include primarily radiation and surgery. He has _________ surviving prostate cancer by Dr. Y. He is aware of incontinency, both total and partial. We discussed erectile dysfunction. We have discussed bleeding, infection, injury to the rectum, injury to vessels and nerves, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, MI, stroke, and death. He had no questions at the conclusion of the conversation and he does know that in his age group, though a nerve-sparing procedure will be performed, preserving any erectile function is highly unlikely. He had no questions at the conclusion of our last conversation.",

His doctor noticed his PSA level rise from 4.2 in July 2008 to 10.5 in April 2009. A transrectal ultrasound and biopsy showed cancer in the left base of the prostate with a Gleason score of 3+4 (total 7) affecting 20% of the tissue removed. The right lobe, middle part, and left tip had a lower Gleason score of 6. A bone scan, cystoscopy, and kidney ultrasound were all normal.\n\n**Surgical History:**  \nAppendectomy.\n\n**Medical History:**  \nAtrial fibrillation.\n\n**Medications:**  \nCoumadin (blood thinner) and lisinopril (blood pressure medicine).\n\n**Social History:**  \nDoes not smoke or drink alcohol.\n\n**Allergies:**  \nNone.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- No recent weight changes, night sweats, fevers, or chills.  \n- Eyes: no vision changes or double vision.  \n- Ears: no ringing or dizziness.  \n- Mouth: no trouble swallowing.  \n- Lungs: no cough or shortness of breath.  \n- Heart: no chest pain or palpitations.  \n- Digestive: no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  \n- Muscles/joints: no pain or stiffness.  \n- Blood: no easy bleeding or bruising.  \n- Skin: no chronic sores or itching.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- **General:** Well‑built and well‑nourished.  \n- **Head/Neck/Eyes:** Head normal size; eyes clear and pupils equal.  \n- **Neck:** No swollen lymph nodes.  \n- **Lungs:** Breathing easy.  \n- **Heart:** Regular rhythm.  \n- **Abdomen:** No enlarged organs or masses.  \n- **Genitals:** Penis normal; scrotum healthy; testicles normal; no pain in the epididymis.  \n- **Rectum:** Prostate feels slightly enlarged (1–2/4) but smooth and even; no suspicious spots.  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Arms and legs symmetrical.  \n- **Neurologic:** No obvious nerve problems.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Prostate cancer.  \n2. Atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Plan:**  \nThe patient and his wife discussed treatment options, mainly radiation and surgery. He will be treated by Dr. Y. He knows that the surgery may cause incontinence (both total and partial) and erectile dysfunction. We talked about possible complications such as bleeding, infection, damage to the rectum, blood vessels, or nerves, blood clots, heart attack, stroke, and death. He understands that, even with a nerve‑sparing procedure, it is unlikely he will keep erectile function at his age. He had no questions after the discussion."
