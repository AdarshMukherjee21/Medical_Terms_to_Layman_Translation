  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies. INDICATION: Abdominal pain. FINDINGS: Antral erythema; 2 cm polypoid pyloric channel tissue, questionable inflammatory polyp which was biopsied; duodenal erythema and erosion. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 200 mcg and versed 6 mg. SCOPE: GIF-Q180. PROCEDURE DETAIL: Following the preprocedure patient assessment the procedure, goals, risks including bleeding, perforation and side effects of medications and alternatives were reviewed. Questions were answered. Pause preprocedure was performed. Following titrated intravenous sedation the flexible video endoscope was introduced into the esophagus and advanced to the second portion of the duodenum without difficulty. The esophagus appeared to have normal motility and mucosa. Regular Z line was located at 44 cm from incisors. No erosion or ulceration. No esophagitis. Upon entering the stomach gastric mucosa was examined in detail including retroflexed views of cardia and fundus. There was pyloric channel and antral erythema, but no visible erosion or ulceration. There was a 2 cm polypoid pyloric channel tissue which was suspicious for inflammatory polyp. This was biopsied and was placed separately in bottle #2. Random gastric biopsies from antrum, incisura and body were obtained and placed in separate jar, bottle #1. No active ulceration was found. Upon entering the duodenal bulb there was extensive erythema and mild erosions, less than 3 mm in length, in first portion of duodenum, duodenal bulb and junction of first and second part of the duodenum. Postbulbar duodenum looked normal. The patient was assessed upon completion of the procedure. Okay to discharge once criteria met. Follow up with primary care physician. I met with patient afterward and discussed with him avoiding any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Await biopsy results.",

A pause was taken before starting.  \nAfter careful IV sedation, the flexible video scope was passed through the mouth, down the esophagus, and into the second part of the duodenum without difficulty. The esophagus looked normal, with a clear Z‑line at 44 cm from the teeth and no ulcers or inflammation.  \nIn the stomach, the lining was examined thoroughly, including a backward view of the cardia and fundus. The pyloric channel and antrum were red but had no visible ulcers. The 2‑cm growth in the pyloric channel was taken for biopsy and placed in bottle #2. Random stomach biopsies from the antrum, incisura, and body were taken and put in bottle #1. No active ulcers were seen.  \nWhen the scope entered the duodenal bulb, there was extensive redness and mild erosions (less than 3 mm) in the first part of the duodenum, the bulb, and the junction of the first and second parts. The part of the duodenum beyond the bulb looked normal.  \nAfter the procedure, the patient was checked and was ready to go home once the criteria were met. The patient was advised to follow up with their primary care doctor. I talked with the patient afterward about avoiding non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs and will wait for the biopsy results."
