  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Upper endoscopy with biopsy. PROCEDURE INDICATION: This is a 44-year-old man who was admitted for coffee-ground emesis, which has been going on for the past several days. An endoscopy is being done to evaluate for source of upper GI bleeding. Informed consent was obtained. Outlining the risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure included, but not to risks of bleeding, infection, perforation, the patient agreed for the procedure. MEDICATIONS: Versed 4 mg IV push and fentanyl 75 mcg IV push given throughout the procedure in incremental fashion with careful monitoring of patient's pressures and vital signs. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Medications were given. After adequate sedation was achieved, the Olympus video endoscope was inserted into the mouth and advanced towards the duodenum. Mucosa ___________. The duodenum appeared normal. The scope was then brought back to the stomach. The antrum and angularis appeared normal as well. The scope was retroflexed to visualize the mucosa of rugal folds, the body, and fundus of the stomach. At the cardia, there was a large fungating ulcerated mass appreciated, which was oozing blood. Biopsies were taken of this mass, which was very firm and likely representing a carcinoma. The scope was then anteflexed and brought back to the distal esophagus. All the esophageal mucosa appeared normal. The squamocolumnar junction appeared normal as well. The scope was removed and procedure terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal esophagus. 2. Normal duodenum. 3. Ulcerated fungating mass at the cardia of the stomach status post biopsies. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. CT chest, abdomen and pelvis for staging. 2. Check CEA. 3. Transfuse as needed. 4. Await biopsy results. 5. Oncology consult, pending biopsy results.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Upper endoscopy with biopsy.  \n\n**Reason for the procedure:** A 44‑year‑old man was admitted because he had been vomiting coffee‑ground‑colored material for several days. The endoscopy was done to find where the upper stomach or esophagus was bleeding. The patient gave informed consent after the doctor explained the risks (bleeding, infection, perforation) and benefits.  \n\n**Medications used:** Versed 4 mg IV and fentanyl 75 mcg IV were given in small doses while the patient’s blood pressure and vital signs were closely watched.  \n\n**What happened during the procedure:**  \n- The patient lay on his left side.  \n- After enough sedation, a video endoscope was passed through the mouth into the stomach and then into the duodenum. The duodenum looked normal.  \n- The scope was pulled back to the stomach. The lower part of the stomach (antrum) and the area near the pylorus (angularis) were normal.  \n- The scope was bent backward (retroflexed) to look at the folds, body, and upper part (fundus) of the stomach. At the cardia (the opening to the esophagus) a large, ulcerated, tumor‑like mass was seen, and it was bleeding. A few tissue samples (biopsies) were taken from the mass, which felt firm and likely cancerous.  \n- The scope was then bent forward (anteflexed) and moved to the lower esophagus. The esophagus and the junction where the squamous lining meets the columnar lining looked normal.  \n- The scope was removed and the procedure was finished. The patient tolerated it well and had no immediate problems.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n1. Normal esophagus.  \n2. Normal duodenum.  \n3. Ulcerated, tumor‑like mass at the cardia of the stomach, biopsied.  \n\n**Next steps:**  \n1. Get a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to stage the disease.  \n2. Check the CEA blood test.  \n3. Transfuse blood if needed.  \n4. Wait for biopsy results.  \n5. Arrange an oncology consultation once the biopsy results are available."
