  "medical": "CLINICAL INDICATIONS: MRSA bacteremia, rule out endocarditis. The patient has aortic stenosis. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The transesophageal echocardiogram was performed after getting verbal and a written consent signed. Then a multiplane TEE probe was introduced into the upper esophagus, mid esophagus, lower esophagus, and stomach and multiple views were obtained. There were no complications. The patient's throat was numbed with Cetacaine spray and IV sedation was achieved with Versed and fentanyl. FINDINGS: 1. Aortic valve is thick and calcified, a severely restricted end opening and there is 0.6 x 8 mm vegetation attached to the right coronary cusp. The peak velocity across the aortic valve was 4.6 m/sec and mean gradient was 53 mmHg and peak gradient 84 mmHg with calculated aortic valve area of 0.6 sq cm by planimetry. 2. Mitral valve is calcified and thick. No vegetation seen. There is mild-to-moderate MR present. There is mild AI present also. 3. Tricuspid valve and pulmonary valve are structurally normal. 4. There is a mild TR present. 5. There is no clot seen in the left atrial appendage. The velocity in the left atrial appendage was 0.6 m/sec. 6. Intraatrial septum was intact. There is no clot or mass seen. 7. Normal LV and RV systolic function. 8. There is thick raised calcified plaque seen in the thoracic aorta and arch. SUMMARY: 1. There is a 0.6 x 0.8 cm vegetation present in the aortic valve with severe aortic stenosis. Calculated aortic valve area was 0.6 sq. cm. 2. Normal LV systolic function.",
  "layman": "**Clinical Reason**  \nThe doctor needed to check for a heart infection (endocarditis) because the patient has MRSA in the blood and a narrowed aortic valve (aortic stenosis).\n\n**Procedure**  \nAfter the patient gave verbal and written permission, a special ultrasound probe was slid into the esophagus (the tube that goes from the throat to the stomach). The probe was moved through the upper, middle, and lower parts of the esophagus and into the stomach to take many pictures. The throat was numbed with a spray of Cetacaine, and the patient was sedated with Versed and fentanyl. No problems happened during the test.\n\n**Findings**  \n\n1. **Aortic valve** – The valve is thick, has calcium deposits, and opens very little. A small growth (vegetation) measuring about 0.6 × 8 mm is attached to the right side of the valve. Blood flows across the valve at a speed of 4.6 m/sec, with a pressure difference (gradient) of 53 mmHg on average and 84 mmHg at the peak. The valve area is calculated to be 0.6 sq cm.\n\n2. **Mitral valve** – The valve is also thick and has calcium. No growths are seen. There is mild to moderate leakage (mitral regurgitation) and mild leakage from the aortic side (aortic insufficiency).\n\n3. **Tricuspid and pulmonary valves** – These valves look normal.\n\n4. **Tricuspid valve** – Mild leakage (tricuspid regurgitation) is present.\n\n5. **Left atrial appendage** – No blood clot is seen. Blood moves through it at 0.6 m/sec.\n\n6. **Interatrial septum** – The wall between the two upper heart chambers is intact, with no clot or mass.\n\n7. **Heart muscle function** – Both the left and right ventricles (the main pumping chambers) are working normally.\n\n8. **Thoracic aorta** – Thick, calcified plaque is seen in the upper part of the aorta and its arch.\n\n**Summary**  \n- A small growth (0.6 × 0.8 cm) is on the aortic valve, which is severely narrowed (area 0.6 sq cm).  \n- The left ventricle’s pumping ability is normal."
