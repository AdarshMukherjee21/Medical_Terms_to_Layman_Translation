  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female with low back pain radiating down the left leg and foot for one and a half years. FINDINGS: High resolution computerized tomography was performed from T12-L1 to the S1 level with reformatted images in the sagittal and coronal planes and 3D reconstructions performed. COMPARISON: Previous MRI examination 10/13/2004. There is minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex to the left. T12-L1, L1-2, L2-3: There is normal disc height with no posterior annular disc bulging or protrusion. Normal central canal, intervertebral neural foramina and facet joints. L3-4: There is normal disc height and non-compressive circumferential annular disc bulging eccentrically greater to the left. Normal central canal and facet joints (image #255). L4-5: There is normal disc height, circumferential annular disc bulging, left L5 hemilaminectomy and posterior central/right paramedian broad-based disc protrusion measuring 4mm (AP) contouring the rightward aspect of the thecal sac. Orthopedic hardware is noted posteriorly at the L5 level. Normal central canal, facet joints and intervertebral neural foramina (image #58). L5-S1: There is minimal decreased disc height, postsurgical change with intervertebral disc spacer, posterior lateral orthopedic hardware with bilateral pedicle screws in good postsurgical position. The orthopedic hardware creates mild streak artifact which mildly degrades images. There is a laminectomy defect, spondylolisthesis with 3.5mm of anterolisthesis of L5, posterior annular disc bulging greatest in the left foraminal region lying adjacent to the exiting left L5 nerve root. There is fusion of the facet joints, normal central canal and right neural foramen (image #69-70, 135). There is no bony destructive change noted. There is no perivertebral soft tissue abnormality. There is minimal to mild arteriosclerotic vascular calcifications noted in the abdominal aorta and right proximal common iliac artery. IMPRESSION: Minimal curvature of the lumbar spine convex to the left. L3-4 posterior non-compressive annular disc bulging eccentrically greater to the left. L4-5 circumferential annular disc bulging, non-compressive central/right paramedian disc protrusion, left L5 laminectomy. L5-S1 postsurgical change with posterolateral orthopedic fusion hardware in good postsurgical position, intervertebral disc spacer, spondylolisthesis, laminectomy defect, posterior annular disc bulging greatest in the left foraminal region adjacent to the exiting left L5 nerve root with questionable neural impingement. Minimal to mild arteriosclerotic vascular calcifications.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged woman who has had low back pain that shoots down her left leg and foot for about a year and a half.  \n\n**Findings**  \nA high‑resolution CT scan was taken from the lower thoracic spine (T12‑L1) down to the first sacral vertebra (S1). The images were reformatted in side‑view (sagittal) and front‑view (coronal) planes and also shown in 3‑D.  \n\n**Comparison**  \nThe scan was compared with an MRI done on 10/13/2004.  \n\n**Spine description**  \n\n- **General** – The lower back (lumbar spine) has a very slight curve that bends to the left.  \n- **T12‑L1, L1‑2, L2‑3** – The discs between these vertebrae are normal in height. There is no bulging or protrusion of the disc material, and the spinal canal, the openings for nerves (foramina), and the facet joints are all normal.  \n- **L3‑4** – The disc height is normal. There is a small, non‑compressing bulge of the disc that is a little larger on the left side. The spinal canal and facet joints are normal.  \n- **L4‑5** – The disc height is normal. There is a small, round bulge of the disc around the whole circumference, and a larger bulge that is on the right side of the spinal canal, measuring about 4 mm from front to back. This bulge presses against the right side of the protective covering of the spinal cord (thecal sac). A piece of orthopedic hardware (a small metal plate or screws) is seen behind the L5 vertebra. The spinal canal, facet joints, and nerve openings are normal.  \n- **L5‑S1** – The disc height is slightly reduced. This area has been operated on: there is a disc spacer (a small device that keeps the space between the vertebrae) and metal screws on both sides of the spine that are in good position. The metal hardware causes a little streaking on the images. There is a hole where part of the vertebra was removed (laminectomy). The L5 vertebra has slipped forward about 3.5 mm (spondylolisthesis). The disc bulges behind the spine, especially on the left side where it is next to the exiting left L5 nerve root. The facet joints are fused together. The spinal canal and the right nerve opening are normal. No bone destruction or abnormal soft tissue around the spine is seen.  \n- **Blood vessels** – There are small, mild calcifications (hardening) in the abdominal aorta and the right common iliac artery.  \n\n**Impression**  \n- A slight left‑bending curve of the lower back.  \n- Small, non‑compressing disc bulges at L3‑4 (more on the left) and L4‑5 (around the whole disc, with a right‑side protrusion).  \n- L5 vertebra has had a laminectomy (removal of part of the bone).  \n- At L5‑S1, there is post‑surgical hardware and a disc spacer in good position, a small forward slip of L5, a hole from the laminectomy, and a disc bulge that is largest on the left side next to the left L5 nerve root, which may be pressing on the nerve.  \n- Mild calcifications in the abdominal blood vessels."
