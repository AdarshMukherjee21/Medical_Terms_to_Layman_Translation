  "medical": "HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Calcium scoring and coronary artery CTA with cardiac function was performed on Siemens dual-source CT scanner with postprocessing on Vitrea workstation. Patient received oral Metoprolol 100 milligrams. 100 ml Ultravist 370 was utilized as the contrast agent. 0.4 milligrams of nitroglycerin was given. Patient's calcium score 164, volume 205; this places the patient between the 75th and 90th percentile for age. There is at least moderate atherosclerotic plaque with mild coronary artery disease and significant narrowings possible. Cardiac wall motion was within normal limits. Left ventricular ejection fraction calculated to be 82%. End-diastolic volume 98 mL, end-systolic volume calculated to be 18 mL. There is normal coronary artery origins. There is codominance between the right coronary artery and the circumflex artery. There is mild to moderate stenosis of the proximal LAD with mixed plaque. Mild stenosis mid LAD with mixed plaque. No stenosis. Distal LAD with the distal vessel becoming diminutive in size. Right coronary artery shows mild stenosis proximally and in the midportion due to calcified focal plaque. Once again the distal vessel becomes diminutive in size. Circumflex shows mild stenosis due to focal calcified plaque proximally. No stenosis is seen involving the mid or distal circumflex. The distal circumflex also becomes diminutive in size. The left main shows small amount of focal calcified plaque without stenosis. Myocardium, pericardium and wall motion was unremarkable as seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with values as above. There are areas of stenosis most pronounced in the LAD with mild to moderate change and mild stenosis involving the circumflex and right coronary artery. 2. Consider cardiology consult and further evaluation if clinically indicated. 3. Full report was sent to the PACS. Report will be mailed to Dr. ABC.",
  "layman": "**History:**  \nThe patient has coronary artery disease.\n\n**Technique and Findings:**  \nA calcium score and coronary CT angiogram (CTA) were done on a Siemens dual‑source CT scanner, with the images processed on a Vitrea workstation.  \nThe patient took 100 mg of oral Metoprolol.  \nContrast dye (100 ml of Ultravist 370) was injected, and 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin was given.  \n\n- Calcium score: 164 (between the 75th and 90th percentiles for age).  \n- Heart function:  \n  - Left ventricular ejection fraction: 82%  \n  - End‑diastolic volume: 98 mL  \n  - End‑systolic volume: 18 mL  \n  - Wall motion: normal  \n\n**Coronary arteries:**  \n- All arteries start normally.  \n- The right coronary artery and the circumflex artery are equally dominant.  \n- Left anterior descending (LAD) artery:  \n  - Mild‑to‑moderate narrowing near the start with mixed plaque.  \n  - Mild narrowing in the middle with mixed plaque.  \n  - No narrowing in the far part; the vessel gets smaller toward the end.  \n- Right coronary artery:  \n  - Mild narrowing at the start and middle because of calcified plaque.  \n  - The far part becomes smaller.  \n- Circumflex artery:  \n  - Mild narrowing at the start due to calcified plaque.  \n  - No narrowing in the middle or far part.  \n  - The far part becomes smaller.  \n- Left main artery:  \n  - Small calcified plaque but no narrowing.  \n\nThe heart muscle, surrounding sac (pericardium), and wall motion are all normal.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. The patient has atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with the findings above.  \n2. The most significant narrowing is in the LAD, with mild narrowing in the circumflex and right coronary arteries.  \n3. A cardiology consult and further evaluation may be needed if the patient’s symptoms or clinical situation warrant it.  \n4. The full report was sent to the PACS and will be mailed to Dr. ABC."
