  "medical": "INDICATION: Prostate Cancer. TECHNIQUE: 3.5 hours following the intravenous administration of 26.5 mCi of Technetium 99m MDP, the skeleton was imaged in the anterior and posterior projections. FINDINGS: There is a focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull. The uptake in the remainder of the skeleton is within normal limits. The kidneys image normally. There is increased activity in the urinary bladder suggesting possible urinary retention. CONCLUSION: 1. Focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull. CT scanning of magnetic resonance imaging of the skull and brain could be done for further assessment if it is clinically indicated. 2. There is probably some degree of urinary retention.",

The rest of the skeleton looks normal. The kidneys appear normal. There is more tracer in the bladder, which may mean the bladder is holding urine.  \n\nCONCLUSION:  \n1. There is an area of increased tracer uptake on the right side of the skull. If needed, a CT or MRI of the skull and brain can be done for more detail.  \n2. The bladder may be retaining some urine."
