  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left spermatocele. 2. Family planning. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left spermatocele. 2. Family planning. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Left spermatocelectomy/epididymectomy. 2. Bilateral partial vasectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. SPECIMEN: Left-sided spermatocele, epididymis, and bilateral partial vasectomy. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. INDICATIONS AND FINDINGS: This is a 48-year-old male with a history of a large left-sided spermatocele with significant discomfort. The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility. The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy. FINDINGS: At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room. A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia. The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach. A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum. Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field. The left testicle was examined. A large spermatocele was noted. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele. Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis. Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis. Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord. The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors. Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends. Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position. The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic. Attention was then turned to the right side. The vas was palpated in the scrotum. A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field. A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat. Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors. Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery. Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum. A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision. Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied. The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition. He was given prescriptions for doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., for five days and Vicodin ES 1 p.o. q.4h. p.r.n., pain, #30 for pain. The patient is to followup with Dr. X in seven days.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:**  \n1. Large left spermatocele (a fluid‑filled cyst in the testicle).  \n2. Wants to plan for family (infertility).\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:**  \nSame as pre‑operative.\n\n**Procedure performed:**  \n1. Removed the left spermatocele and part of the epididymis.  \n2. Cut a small section of the vas deferens on both sides (partial vasectomy).\n\n**Anesthesia:** General (the patient was asleep).\n\n**Estimated blood loss:** Minimal.\n\n**Specimen sent for analysis:** Left spermatocele, epididymis, and both sides of the vasectomy.\n\n**Disposition:** Patient went to the recovery area (PACU) in stable condition.\n\n**Indications and findings:**  \nA 48‑year‑old man had a large left spermatocele that caused him a lot of discomfort. He also wanted to become infertile. He was scheduled for elective removal of the left spermatocele and a partial vasectomy on both sides.\n\n**Findings during surgery:**  \nThe left spermatocele was so large it covered almost the entire left epididymis, leaving only a small normal part.\n\n**Procedure description:**  \nAfter the patient gave consent, he was taken to the operating room and put under general anesthesia. The area was cleaned and covered in sterile drapes for a scrotal (testicle) approach. A small horizontal cut was made on the left side of the scrotum with a #15 blade. The incision was deepened with electrocautery until the tunica vaginalis (the covering of the testicle) was reached, and the left testicle was pulled out.\n\nThe surgeon saw the large spermatocele. Using Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery, the cyst was carefully separated from the testicle and the epididymis. The spermatocele and part of the epididymis were removed. Electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding.\n\nNext, the surgeon worked on the vas deferens (the tube that carries sperm). The vas was found and freed with scissors. A 1‑cm section of the vas was cut out. Both ends were sealed with electrocautery and tied with silk sutures. The testicle was put back into the scrotum in the correct position. The overlying tissue (dartos) was closed with a running #3‑0 Vicryl stitch, and the skin was closed with a horizontal interrupted mattress stitch using #4‑0 chromic.\n\nThe right side was treated similarly. A small skin cut was made, the vas was grasped and freed, and a 1‑cm section was removed. Both ends were sealed with electrocautery and tied with silk sutures. The skin was closed with a simple #4‑0 chromic stitch. The scrotum was cleaned, bacitracin ointment applied, a sterile dressing and supportive briefs were put on.\n\nThe patient was sent to recovery in stable condition. He was given prescriptions for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for five days and Vicodin ES 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed for pain (up to 30 tablets). He is scheduled to see Dr. X in seven days."
