  "medical": "This is a 63-year-old female complaining of neck pain. Patient is status post MVA (rear-ended) on 02/10/2006. FINDINGS:Normal foramen magnum. Normal brainstem-cervical cord junction. There is no tonsillar ectopia. Normal clivus and craniovertebral junction. Normal anterior atlantoaxial articulation. C2-3: There is disc desiccation but no loss of disc space height, disc displacement, endplate spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina. C3-4: There is disc desiccation with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type. The small posterior central disc protrusion measures 3 x 6mm (AP x transverse) in size and is producing ventral thecal sac flattening. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 9mm. There is minimal right-sided uncovertebral joint arthrosis but no substantial foraminal compromise. C4-5: There is disc desiccation, slight loss of disc space height with a right posterior lateral pre-foraminal disc osteophyte complex with right-sided uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis. The disc osteophyte complex measures approximately 5mm in its AP dimension. There is minimal posterior annular bulging measuring approximately 2mm. The AP diameter of the central canal has been narrowed to 9mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. There is probable radicular impingement upon the exiting right C5 nerve root. C5-6: There is disc desiccation, moderate loss of disc space height with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type. The disc protrusion measures approximately 3 x 8mm (AP x transverse) in size. There is ventral thecal sac flattening with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. The residual AP diameter of the central canal has been narrowed to 7mm. Findings indicate a loss of the functional reserve of the central canal but there is no cord edema. There is bilateral uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis with moderate foraminal compromise. C6-7: There is disc desiccation, mild loss of disc space height with 2mm of posterior annular bulging. There is bilateral uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis (left greater than right) with probable radicular impingement upon the bilateral exiting C7 nerve roots. C7-T1, T1-2: There is disc desiccation with no disc displacement. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina. T3-4: There is disc desiccation with minimal 2mm posterior annular bulging but normal central canal and CSF surrounding the cord. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc disease with uncovertebral joint arthrosis with foraminal compromise as described above. C3-4 posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type but no cord impingement. C4-5 right posterior lateral disc osteophyte complex with right-sided uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis with probable radicular impingement upon the right C5 nerve root. C5-6 degenerative disc disease with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type producing borderline central canal stenosis with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft indicating a limited functional reserve of the central canal. C6-7 degenerative disc disease with annular bulging and osseous foraminal compromise with probable impingement upon the bilateral exiting C7 nerve roots. T3-4 degenerative disc disease with posterior annular bulging.",
  "layman": "This 63‑year‑old woman has neck pain. She was in a rear‑end car crash on February 10, 2006. The scan shows:\n\n* The base of the skull and the brain‑spine junction are normal.  \n* The upper part of the spine (C2‑C3) has a dry disc but no loss of height, no disc slip, no bone damage, and the spinal canal is normal.  \n* At C3‑C4 the disc is dry and has a small central bulge (3 × 6 mm) that slightly presses on the front of the spinal cord. The spinal fluid is still around the cord and the canal is 9 mm wide. There is a little joint wear on the right side but the nerve openings are fine.  \n* At C4‑C5 the disc is dry, the space is a bit smaller, and a bone‑disc growth on the right side (about 5 mm) is pressing on the right C5 nerve root. The canal is 9 mm wide and fluid is still present.  \n* At C5‑C6 the disc is dry, the space is moderately smaller, and a central bulge (3 × 8 mm) is pressing on the front of the cord, narrowing the canal to 7 mm. The fluid around the cord is almost gone, showing the canal is almost full. Both sides have joint wear and the nerve openings are moderately narrowed.  \n* At C6‑C7 the disc is dry, the space is mildly smaller, and there is a 2 mm bulge. Both sides have joint wear (left more than right) and the nerve openings are likely narrowed, affecting both C7 nerve roots.  \n* At C7‑T1 and T1‑T2 the discs are dry with no slip, and the canal and nerve openings are normal.  \n* At T3‑T4 the disc is dry with a 2 mm bulge, but the canal and fluid are normal.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe patient has degenerative changes in several neck levels with joint wear and some narrowing of the nerve openings. The disc bulges at C3‑C4, C4‑C5, C5‑C6, C6‑C7, and T3‑T4 are described, but only the C5‑C6 bulge is close to blocking the spinal canal. The right C5 nerve root and both C7 nerve roots may be pinched by the bone‑disc growths and joint wear."
