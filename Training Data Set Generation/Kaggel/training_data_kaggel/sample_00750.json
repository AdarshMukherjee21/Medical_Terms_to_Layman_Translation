  "medical": "DIAGNOSES ON ADMISSION 1. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right arm weakness. 2. Bronchitis. 3. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Thrombocytopenia. DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE 1. Cerebrovascular accident with right arm weakness and MRI indicating acute/subacute infarct involving the left posterior parietal lobe without mass effect. 2. Old coronary infarct, anterior aspect of the right external capsule. 3. Acute bronchitis with reactive airway disease. 4. Thrombocytopenia most likely due to old coronary infarct, anterior aspect of the right external capsule. 5. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 6. Hyperlipidemia. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room. Plavix was started in addition to baby aspirin. He was kept on oral Zithromax for his cough. He was given Xopenex treatment, because of his respiratory distress. Carotid ultrasound was reviewed and revealed a 50 to 69% obstruction of left internal carotid. Dr. X saw him in consultation and recommended CT angiogram. This showed no significant obstructive lesion other than what was known on the ultrasound. Head MRI was done and revealed the above findings. The patient was begun on PT and improved. By discharge, he had much improved strength in his right arm. He had no further progressions. His cough improved with oral Zithromax and nebulizer treatments. His platelets also improved as well. By discharge, his platelets was up to 107,000. His H&H was stable at 41.7 and 14.6 and his white count was 4300 with a normal differential. Chest x-ray revealed a mild elevated right hemidiaphragm, but no infiltrate. Last chemistry panel on December 5, 2003, sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 106, CO2 23, glucose 88, BUN 17, creatinine 0.7, calcium was 9.1. PT/INR on admission was 1.03, PTT 34.7. At the time of discharge, the patient's cough was much improved. His right arm weakness has much improved. His lung examination has just occasional rhonchi. He was changed to a metered dose inhaler with albuterol. He is being discharged home. An echocardiogram revealed mild concentric LVH with normal left ventricular function with an EF of 57%, moderate left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction with mild mitral regurgitation. He will follow up in my office in 1 week. He is to start PT and OT as an outpatient. He is to avoid driving his car. He is to notify, if further symptoms. He has 2 more doses of Zithromax at home, he will complete. His prognosis is good.",
  "layman": "**DIAGNOSES ON ADMISSION**  \n1. Stroke that caused weakness in the right arm.  \n2. Bronchitis (inflammation of the airways).  \n3. Atherosclerotic heart disease (plaque buildup in the arteries).  \n4. High cholesterol.  \n5. Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).  \n\n**DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE**  \n1. Stroke with right‑arm weakness; MRI shows a recent or slightly older stroke in the left back part of the brain, no pressure on the brain.  \n2. Old heart attack in the front part of the right side of the brain.  \n3. Acute bronchitis with reactive airway disease.  \n4. Low platelet count, probably related to the old heart attack.  \n5. Atherosclerotic heart disease.  \n6. High cholesterol.  \n\n**HOSPITAL COURSE**  \nThe patient was taken to the emergency room.  \n- He was started on Plavix and baby aspirin to help prevent blood clots.  \n- He received oral Zithromax for his cough.  \n- Xopenex (a bronchodilator) was used because he had breathing trouble.  \n- A carotid ultrasound showed a 50–69% blockage in the left internal carotid artery.  \n- A doctor reviewed the results and ordered a CT angiogram, which confirmed no new major blockages.  \n- An MRI of the head confirmed the stroke findings.  \n- Physical therapy was started and his right‑arm strength improved.  \n- His cough got better with Zithromax and nebulizer treatments.  \n- Platelet count rose to 107,000.  \n- Hemoglobin and hematocrit were stable at 41.7 and 14.6. White blood cell count was 4,300 with a normal mix of cells.  \n- Chest X‑ray showed a slightly raised right diaphragm but no lung infection.  \n- The last blood chemistry panel (Dec 5, 2003) was normal: sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 106, CO₂ 23, glucose 88, BUN 17, creatinine 0.7, calcium 9.1.  \n- Blood clotting tests on admission were PT/INR 1.03 and PTT 34.7.  \n- At discharge, his cough and right‑arm weakness had improved, and he had only occasional wheezing sounds in his lungs.  \n- He was switched to a metered‑dose inhaler with albuterol.  \n- An echocardiogram showed mild thickening of the left ventricle walls, normal pumping function (EF 57%), moderate enlargement of the left atrium, mild diastolic dysfunction, and mild mitral valve leak.  \n\n**FOLLOW‑UP AND OUTPATIENT PLAN**  \n- He will see the doctor in one week.  \n- He will start outpatient physical and occupational therapy.  \n- He should not drive until cleared.  \n- If new symptoms appear, he should call the office.  \n- He has two more doses of Zithromax to finish at home.  \n- His overall outlook is good."
