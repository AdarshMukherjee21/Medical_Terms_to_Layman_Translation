  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Osteomyelitis, right hallux. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Osteomyelitis, right hallux. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Amputation distal phalanx and partial proximal phalanx, right hallux. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 44-year-old male patient was admitted to ABCD General Hospital on 09/02/2003 with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the right hallux and cellulitis of the right lower extremity. The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed. The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis. The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X. The consent was available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist. Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block. The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field. Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm. There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally. The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size. There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected. The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively. X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx. A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx. The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact. Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed. The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology. Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected. Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx. This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin. Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected. The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable. A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally. None was found. No purulent drainage or abscess was found. The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy. There was no malodor. Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology. Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound. A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension. The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors. The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures. Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap. An excellent cosmetic result was achieved. No tourniquet was used in this case. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications. A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban. The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot. He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications. Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations. He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches. He will elevate his right foot and rest the foot, keep it clean and dry. He is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday of next week.",

He has diabetes and a long‑standing sore on the big toe that did not heal with outpatient antibiotics. After trying wound care and antibiotics, the doctors offered amputation as a treatment for the stubborn infection. The patient chose surgery. Dr. X explained the risks and benefits in detail. Consent was recorded on the chart.  \n\n**PROCEDURE IN DETAIL**  \nThe patient was moved to the operating room, placed on the table lying on his back, and a safety strap was put around his waist. The anesthesia team gave him IV sedation. A mixture of 1 % lidocaine and 0.5 % Marcaine (1:1) was injected into the right big toe as a digital block. The foot was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nThe surgeon examined the big toe, which had a full‑thickness sore at the tip measuring 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. A tract was seen that went through the tip bone and along the sides of the next bone. The toe was 2.5 times larger than normal. There were shallow, non‑infected sores on the inside arch of both feet from a previous burn. The patient had good pulses in both feet before surgery. X‑ray showed the tip bone was completely separated and the side of the next bone was possibly separated.  \n\nA #10 blade was used to cut across the bone just above the head of the next bone. The cut went from side to side and down toward the sole, leaving most of the sole skin intact. The tip bone was then separated at the joint and removed. The removed part was sent to the lab for bone culture and tissue testing.  \n\nThe head of the next bone was examined and found to be soft on the outer side. A saw was used to cut about 0.75 cm from the outer part of the head of the next bone. That piece was also sent for culture and labeled “proximal margin.”  \n\nThe long tendon that pulls the big toe was found, pulled as far down as possible, and cut. The tendon was gray and not healthy. A clamp was used to check the tendon sheath for infection moving up the tendon; none was found. No pus or abscess was seen. The tissue at the top of the surgical site was healthy and smelled normal. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  \n\nA large amount of gentamicin solution and saline were poured into the wound. A #3‑0 Vicryl suture was used to close the deep layer of tissue to relieve skin tension. The skin flap on the sole was trimmed with scissors. The flap was folded over the top of the toe and sewn back together carefully with #3‑0 nylon using simple and mattress stitches. Scissors were used to shape the flap. The final look was cosmetically good. No tourniquet was used.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the anesthesia and surgery without obvious problems. A standard dressing was applied using saline‑soaked Owen silk, 4 × 4 gauze, Kerlix, and Coban bandage. The patient was moved to the recovery area with stable vital signs and good blood flow to the right foot.  \n\nHe will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman’s care to monitor blood pressure and medications. The plan is to keep taking antibiotics as directed by the IV team. He will not put weight on the right foot and will use crutches. He should keep the foot elevated, rest, keep it clean and dry. He will see Dr. X next Monday or Tuesday."
