  "medical": "EXAM: Skull, complete, five images HISTORY: Plagiocephaly. TECHNIQUE: Multiple images of the skull were evaluated. There are no priors for comparison. FINDINGS: Multiple images of the skull were evaluated and they reveal radiographic visualization of the cranial sutures without evidence of closure. There is no evidence of any craniosynostosis. There is no radiographic evidence of plagiocephaly. IMPRESSION: No evidence of craniosynostosis or radiographic characteristics for plagiocephaly.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Skull, complete, five images  \nHISTORY: Plagiocephaly.  \nTECHNIQUE: We looked at several pictures of the skull. There were no previous images to compare with.  \nFINDINGS: The pictures show the skull’s joints (sutures) and they are still open. There is no sign that the sutures have fused early (craniosynostosis). The images also do not show any signs of plagiocephaly.  \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of early suture closure or plagiocephaly on the X‑rays."
