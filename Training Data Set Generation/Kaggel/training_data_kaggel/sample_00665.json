  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right chronic subdural hematoma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right chronic subdural hematoma. TYPE OF OPERATION: Right burr hole craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma and placement of subdural drain. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100 cc. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: In preoperative identification, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. Following induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery. Table was turned. The right shoulder roll was placed. The head was turned to the left and rested on a doughnut. The scalp was shaved, and then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Incisions were marked along a putative right frontotemporal craniotomy frontally and over the parietal boss. The parietal boss incision was opened. It was about an inch and a half in length. It was carried down to the skull. Self-retaining retractor was placed. A bur hole was now fashioned with the perforator. This was widened with a 2-mm Kerrison punch. The dura was now coagulated with bipolar electrocautery. It was opened in a cruciate-type fashion. The dural edges were coagulated back to the bony edges. There was egress of a large amount of liquid. Under pressure, we irrigated for quite sometime until irrigation was returning mostly clear. A subdural drain was now inserted under direct vision into the subdural space and brought out through a separate stab incision. It was secured with a 3-0 nylon suture. The area was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with staples. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient was subsequently returned back to anesthesia. He was extubated in the operating room, and transported to PACU in satisfactory condition.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: A long‑standing blood collection on the right side of the brain.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as before.  \n\nTYPE OF OPERATION: A small hole was made in the right side of the skull to remove the blood and place a drain.  \n\nANESTHESIA: The patient was put under general anesthesia with a breathing tube.  \n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: About 100 milliliters.  \n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and laid on their back. After the anesthesia worked, the surgical team prepared the area. The table was turned and a roll was placed under the right shoulder. The head was turned to the left and rested on a doughnut‑shaped support. The scalp was shaved, cleaned, and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nIncisions were marked for a front‑top skull cut on the right side. The cut was about 1½ inches long and was opened to the skull. A self‑retaining retractor was used. A small hole was made with a drill and widened with a 2‑mm punch. The outer covering of the brain (dura) was cauterized and cut in a cross shape. The edges were cauterized back to the bone. A large amount of fluid came out. The area was irrigated until the fluid was mostly clear.  \n\nA drain was placed directly into the space under the dura and brought out through a separate small cut. It was tied with a 3‑0 nylon suture. The wound was closed with 2‑0 Vicryl stitches, and the skin was closed with staples. A sterile dressing was applied.  \n\nThe patient was taken back to the anesthesia team, the breathing tube was removed in the operating room, and the patient was sent to the recovery area in good condition."
