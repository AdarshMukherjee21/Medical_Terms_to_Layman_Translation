  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nausea and vomiting and upper abdominal pain. POST PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Normal upper endoscopy. OPERATION: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with antral biopsies for H. pylori x2 with biopsy forceps. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation 50 mg Demerol, 8 mg of Versed. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite. After adequate IV sedation with the above medications, hurricane was sprayed in the mouth as well as in the esophagus. A bite block was placed and the gastroscope placed into the mouth and was passed into the esophagus and negotiated through the esophagus, stomach, and pylorus. The first, second, and third portions of the duodenum were normal. The scope was withdrawn into the antrum which was normal and two bites with the biopsy forceps were taken in separate spots for H. pylori. The scope was retroflexed which showed a normal GE junction from the inside of the stomach and no evidence of pathology or paraesophageal hernia. The scope was withdrawn at the GE junction which was in a normal position with a normal transition zone. The scope was then removed throughout the esophagus which was normal. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The plan is to obtain a HIDA scan as the right upper quadrant ultrasound appeared to be normal, although previous ultrasounds several years ago showed a gallstone.",

After receiving the IV sedation, a spray was used in the mouth and throat. A bite block was placed, and the scope was inserted through the mouth, down the esophagus, into the stomach, and past the pylorus. The first, second, and third parts of the duodenum looked normal. The scope was pulled back into the antrum (lower part of the stomach) which was normal, and two small tissue samples were taken from different spots to test for H. pylori. The scope was then turned back (retroflexed) to look at the junction where the esophagus meets the stomach from inside the stomach; it was normal and showed no problems or hernia. The scope was withdrawn to the junction, which was in a normal position with a normal transition zone. The scope was then removed through the esophagus, which was normal. The patient tolerated the procedure well.  \n\nPLAN: A HIDA scan will be done because the right upper‑quadrant ultrasound was normal, even though earlier ultrasounds a few years ago had shown a gallstone."
