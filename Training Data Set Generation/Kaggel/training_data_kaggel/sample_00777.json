  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm Hemashield tube graft. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. OPERATIVE TIME: Three hours. ANESTHESIA TIME: Four hours. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After thorough preoperative evaluation, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position and after placement of upper extremity IV access and radial A-line, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed. The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape. A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered. A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed. With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities. The transverse colon retracted superiorly. The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant. The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein. Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries. The mid left renal artery was likewise identified. The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery. During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis. The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery. The arteries were suitable for control. The patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time. The aneurysm was repaired. First, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps. The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery. The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed. There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site. The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp. Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk. A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture. At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis. The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture. Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation. The distal anastomosis was competent without leak. The patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation. The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous. The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk. The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion. The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS. The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera. The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location. The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture. The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution. The skin edges coapted using surgical staples. At the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** The surgeon repaired a large abdominal aortic aneurysm that was close to the kidneys using a 14‑mm Hemashield tube graft.\n\n**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same.\n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia with a breathing tube.  \n**Operative time:** 3 hours.  \n**Anesthesia time:** 4 hours.\n\n**What was done:**\n\n1. The patient was examined carefully before surgery.  \n2. In the operating room, she was put on the table lying on her back.  \n3. IV lines were placed in her arms and a central line was put in her right neck.  \n4. A urinary catheter was inserted.  \n5. The chest, belly, both groins, and genital area were cleaned with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes.  \n6. A long cut was made from the bottom of the sternum to the pubic bone.  \n7. The belly was opened and a special retractor was used to hold the abdominal wall back.  \n8. The surgeon looked inside and found no other problems.  \n9. The large intestine was moved up and the small intestine was wrapped in a damp towel and moved to the right upper side.  \n10. The tissue covering the aneurysm was cut and the ligament of Treitz was moved.  \n11. The inferior mesenteric vein was tied off and cut.  \n12. The surgeon worked upward to find the left kidney’s vein and the right and left lower kidney arteries.  \n13. The artery to the middle part of the left kidney was also found.  \n14. The aorta around the kidney was prepared for a clamp above the left lower kidney artery.  \n15. While doing this, the patient received small doses of mannitol to help her kidneys flush out waste.  \n16. The lower part of the dissection finished by exposing both common iliac arteries.  \n17. The arteries were ready to be clamped.  \n18. The patient was given 8000 units of heparin to prevent clots, and the blood’s clotting time was checked.  \n19. The aneurysm was repaired:  \n    * The common carotid arteries were clamped gently.  \n    * The left lower kidney artery was clamped with a tiny clamp and a straight clamp was used on the aorta above it.  \n    * The aneurysm was opened on the right side and the inside of the aneurysm sac was cleaned out.  \n    * A severe narrowing at the start of the inferior mesenteric artery was found and was cleaned with a special technique.  \n    * Two small lumbar arteries were tied off with 2‑0 silk thread.  \n20. A 14‑mm Hemashield tube graft was chosen.  \n21. The graft was sewn to the top part of the aorta with a continuous 3‑0 Prolene stitch.  \n22. Three extra stitches were added to stop bleeding.  \n23. The graft was cut to the right length and sewn to the split of the iliac arteries with the same type of stitch.  \n24. Before finishing, the graft was flushed of air and debris. Blood flow was slowly restored first to the pelvis by pressing on the femoral vessels, then to the lower body.  \n25. The lower connection was tight and had no leaks.  \n26. The patient received 70 mg of protamine to reverse the heparin, and any remaining bleeding was stopped with an electric cautery device.  \n27. The back of the inferior mesenteric artery was checked; it was still pumping strongly. The artery was tied off with 2‑0 silk.  \n28. The aneurysm sac was closed snugly around the graft using 3‑0 PDS stitches in a “vest‑over‑pants” style.  \n29. The back layer of the belly was sewn together with running 3‑0 PDS stitches.  \n30. All the large and small intestines were inspected; they were well‑perfused and looked normal.  \n31. A nasogastric tube was placed into the stomach.  \n32. The intestines were put back in their normal positions.  \n33. The belly’s middle layer (fascia) was sewn together with running #1 PDS stitches.  \n34. The under‑skin tissue was washed with a bacitracin‑kanamycin solution.  \n35. The skin edges were closed with surgical staples.  \n36. At the end, all sponges and needles were counted correctly, and a sterile, tight dressing was applied."
