  "medical": "DIAGNOSES: 1. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. 2. Recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure. MEDICATIONS: 1. Lamictal 250 mg b.i.d. 2. Depo-Provera. INTERIM HISTORY: The patient returns for followup. Since last consultation she has tolerated Lamictal well, but she has had a recurrence of her myoclonic jerking. She has not had a generalized seizure. She is very concerned that this will occur. Most of the myoclonus is in the mornings. Recent EEG did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally, more prominent on the left. She states that she has been very compliant with the medications and is getting a good amount of sleep. She continues to drive. Social history and review of systems are discussed above and documented on the chart. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. There is no nystagmus. Visual fields are full. Demeanor is normal. Facial sensation and symmetry is normal. No myoclonic jerks noted during this examination. No myoclonic jerks provoked by tapping on her upper extremity muscles. Negative orbit. Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric. Gait is normal. Tandem gait is normal. Romberg negative. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite high levels of Lamictal. She is tolerating the medication well and has not had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She is concerned that this is a precursor for another generalized seizure. She states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleep-wake cycle. Looking back through her notes, she initially responded very well to Keppra, but did have a breakthrough seizure on Keppra. This was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young. Because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective, I have recommended adding Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient. I will see in followup in three months.",

Depo‑Provera.  \n\n**Interim History**  \nThe patient came back for a follow‑up. Since the last visit she has tolerated Lamictal well, but she has had another episode of myoclonic jerking. She has not had a generalized seizure. She is worried that a generalized seizure might happen. Most of the jerking happens in the morning. A recent EEG showed abnormal spikes and slow waves on both sides of the brain, especially on the left. She says she has been taking her medicines as prescribed and is getting enough sleep. She still drives. Her social history and review of systems were discussed and recorded in the chart.  \n\n**Physical Examination**  \nVital signs are normal.  \nPupils are equal and react to light.  \nEye movements are normal; no nystagmus.  \nVisual fields are full.  \nShe looks normal.  \nFace sensation and symmetry are normal.  \nNo jerking was seen during the exam, and tapping her arms did not provoke jerks.  \nNo eye movement abnormalities.  \nDeep‑tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetrical.  \nShe walks normally; tandem gait is normal.  \nRomberg test is negative.  \n\n**Impression and Plan**  \nShe has had a return of early‑morning jerking even though her Lamictal levels are high. She tolerates the medication well and has not had another generalized seizure. She is concerned that the jerking could lead to a generalized seizure. She says she takes her medicines as directed and sleeps normally. Reviewing her records, she initially responded well to Keppra, but had a breakthrough seizure on Keppra, likely because of severe insomnia when her baby was very young. Because she tolerated Keppra and it helped, I recommended adding Keppra 500 mg twice a day. We discussed the possible side effects. I will see her again in three months."
