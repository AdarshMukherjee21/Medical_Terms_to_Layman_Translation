  "medical": "EXAM: Mammographic screening FFDM HISTORY: 40-year-old female who is on oral contraceptive pills. She has no present symptomatic complaints. No prior history of breast surgery nor family history of breast CA. TECHNIQUE: Standard CC and MLO views of the breasts. COMPARISON: This is the patient's baseline study. FINDINGS: The breasts are composed of moderately to significantly dense fibroglandular tissue. The overlying skin is unremarkable. There are a tiny cluster of calcifications in the right breast, near the central position associated with 11:30 on a clock. There are benign-appearing calcifications in both breasts as well as unremarkable axillary lymph nodes. There are no spiculated masses or architectural distortion. IMPRESSION: Tiny cluster of calcifications at the 11:30 position of the right breast. Recommend additional views; spot magnification in the MLO and CC views of the right breast. BIRADS Classification 0 - Incomplete MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION: 1. A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography. 2. Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present. 3. These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2 was utilized.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Mammogram screening (full-field digital mammography)\n\nHISTORY: 40‑year‑old woman taking birth‑control pills. She has no current symptoms. She has never had breast surgery and no family history of breast cancer.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Standard craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views of both breasts.\n\nCOMPARISON: This is her first study, so there is nothing to compare with.\n\nFINDINGS: The breasts contain moderately to highly dense tissue. The skin looks normal. A small group of tiny calcium deposits is seen in the right breast, near the center at the 11:30 position on a clock face. Similar benign‑looking calcium deposits are present in both breasts, and the lymph nodes under the arms look normal. No spiky masses or distortion of breast tissue are seen.\n\nIMPRESSION: Small cluster of calcium deposits at the 11:30 position of the right breast. Additional detailed views (spot magnification) of the right breast in both CC and MLO positions are recommended.\n\nBIRADS Classification: 0 – Incomplete\n\nMAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:\n1. About 10% to 15% of cancers may not be seen on a mammogram.\n2. If a suspicious lump is felt, a biopsy should still be considered even if the mammogram looks normal.\n3. The images were taken with FDA‑approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2 was used."
