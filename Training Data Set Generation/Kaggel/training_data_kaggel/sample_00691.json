  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve. Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve. Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected. Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized. Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly. The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass. Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve. A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound. The elbow was dressed and splinted. The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "**Procedure: Moving the ulnar nerve under the skin**\n\nAfter giving the patient the right antibiotics and local anesthesia, the arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. The arm was emptied of blood with a tourniquet that was set to 250 mmHg. A curved cut was made on the inside of the elbow, starting near the muscle wall, going behind the bony bump, then forward along the path of the ulnar nerve. The surgeon carefully cut down to the nerve. Small branches of the nearby nerves were found and protected. The tight tissue called Osborne’s fascia was cut open, the nerve was freed from surrounding scar tissue, and the nerve was moved. About 6 cm of the muscle wall was removed, and the attachment of the flexor‑carpi‑ulnaris muscle was released so the nerve wouldn’t bend when moved forward. A layer just above the flexor‑pronator muscle was opened. The surgeon stopped any bleeding with a small electric cautery. The nerve was moved to the front, staying above the flexor‑pronator muscle. The nerve’s motor branches were carefully separated at both ends to keep it from getting stuck or bent. A semi‑circular flap of the flexor‑pronator fascia was lifted and sewn to the skin layer to keep the nerve in place. The skin and the tissue beneath it were closed with simple stitches. A local anesthetic with a blood‑constricting agent was injected into the wound. The elbow was covered and a splint was applied. The patient woke up and went to recovery in good shape, having tolerated the surgery well."
