  "medical": "HYPERFRACTIONATION This patient is to undergo a course of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of known malignancy. The radiotherapy will be given in a hyperfractionated fraction (decreased dose per fraction but 2 fractions delivered daily separated by a period of at least 6 hours). The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiologic principles that make this type of therapy more effective in rapidly growing, previously irradiated or poorly oxygenated tumors. The dose per fraction and the total dose are calculated by me, and this is individualized for each patient according to radiobiologic principles. During the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, the chance of severe acute side effects is increased, so the patient will be followed more intensively for the development of any side effects and treatment instituted accordingly.",
  "layman": "**Hyperfractionated Radiotherapy**  \nThis patient will receive a special type of radiation treatment for a known cancer. The treatment will use smaller doses of radiation, but two doses will be given each day, with at least six hours between them. This approach is based on science that shows it can work better for fast‑growing tumors, tumors that have already been treated with radiation, or tumors that have low oxygen levels. I will calculate the dose for each session and the total amount of radiation, tailoring it to this patient’s specific situation. Because this method can increase the chance of serious short‑term side effects, the patient will be monitored closely and any side effects will be treated promptly."
