POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: History of compartment syndrome, right lower extremity, status post 4 compartments fasciotomy, to do incision for compartment fasciotomy. OPERATIONS: 1. Wound debridement x2, including skin, subcutaneous, and muscle. 2. Insertion of tissue expander to the medial wound. 3. Insertion of tissue expander to the lateral wound. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET: None. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This patient developed a compartment syndrome. She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg. She was doing very well and was obviously improving. The swelling was reduced. A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination. She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure. The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well. Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. She understood them well. All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm. The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width. Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided. The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion. This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides. At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present. Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander. On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately. I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor. I then did place adequate tension on the sutures. Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller. At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound. The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin. The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors. The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied. It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained. Adequate tension was placed in this region. A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied. No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: The patient has a history of compartment syndrome in the right lower leg and has already had a 4‑compartment fasciotomy. She is scheduled for another incision to help the fasciotomy.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Same as preoperative – history of compartment syndrome in the right lower leg, status after a 4‑compartment fasciotomy, and a new incision for the fasciotomy.\n\nOPERATIONS:\n1. Two wound debridements – removal of dead skin, fat, and muscle tissue.\n2. Placement of a tissue expander in the medial (inner) wound.\n3. Placement of a tissue expander in the lateral (outer) wound.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\n\nTOURNIQUET: None.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia.\n\nINDICATIONS: The patient developed compartment syndrome. She had a 4‑compartment fasciotomy with two incisions on the inner and outer sides of the right lower leg. She was doing well, swelling was less, and pressure in the leg had improved. Because the wounds were healing, she was offered a tissue expander to help close the front of the leg. The doctor explained the risks (bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels or nerves, need for more surgery, chronic pain, ongoing discomfort, possible blood clots, lung problems, heart attack, and death) and alternatives. The patient understood everything, asked questions, and signed the consent form.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was put on the operating table and given general anesthesia. The inner wound measured about 10.5 cm long by 4 cm wide. The outer wound measured about 14 cm long by 5 cm wide. Both wounds were cleaned by removing dead skin, fat, and a small amount of dead muscle. Healthy tissue was left. For the inner wound, a DermaClose RC tissue expander was attached. Five skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and connected with a loop of tape that was tightened with a tension controller. The same technique was used for the outer wound. The skin edges were loosened a bit before placing the anchors to allow the skin to move. After the anchors were set, a light dressing and a sterile cover were applied. No problems happened during the surgery, and the patient left the operating room in stable condition."
