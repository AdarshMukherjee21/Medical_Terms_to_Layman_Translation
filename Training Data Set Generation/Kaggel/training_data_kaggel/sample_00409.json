  "medical": "CC: Headache. HX: 63 y/o RHF first seen by Neurology on 9/14/71 for complaint of episodic vertigo. During that evaluation she described a several year history of &quot;migraine&quot; headaches. She experienced her first episode of vertigo in 1969. The vertigo (clockwise) typically began suddenly after lying down, and was not associated with nausea/vomiting/headache. The vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hours to days. On 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity AD. She complained of associated tinnitus which she described as a &quot;whistle.&quot; In addition, her symptoms appeared to worsen with changes in head position (i.e. looking up or down). The symptoms gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. She was seen 9/14/71, in Neurology, and admitted for evaluation. Her neurologic exam at that time was unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. Cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm AVM in the right parietal region. The AVM was primarily fed by the right MCA. Otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from Meniere's disease. On 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for SAH secondary to right parietal AVM. On 11/23/91 she was admitted for left sided weakness (LUE &gt; LLE), headache, and transient visual change. Neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the LUE only. Brain CT confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. She underwent unsuccessful embolization. Neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left MCA, they were unable to cannulate many of the AVM vessels and abandoned the procedure. She recovered with residual left hemisensory loss. In 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and was managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention. In 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ.",
  "layman": "Headache.  \n63‑year‑old woman first saw a neurologist on 9/14/1971 because she had episodes of vertigo. She said she had had “migraine” headaches for several years. Her first vertigo episode was in 1969. The vertigo (spinning clockwise) usually started suddenly after she lay down and did not come with nausea, vomiting, or a headache. It was not always linked to moving her head and could last from hours to days.  \n\nOn 3/15/1971, after a 5‑day period of vertigo, right ear pain, and trouble walking (because of the vertigo), she went to the doctor. An audiogram showed a 20% drop in her low‑tone hearing. She also had ringing in her ears that she described as a “whistle.” Her symptoms seemed worse when she changed head position (looking up or down). The symptoms gradually got better until 8/1971 when she had a 19‑day episode of vertigo, tinnitus, and occasional headaches. She was seen again on 9/14/1971 in Neurology and was admitted for evaluation. Her neurological exam was normal except for loud sounds in both carotid arteries. A brain angiogram found an inoperable 7 × 6 cm arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right parietal area, mainly fed by the right middle cerebral artery. An ear, nose, and throat doctor thought she also had Meniere’s disease.  \n\nOn 10/14/1974 she was admitted for 21 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) caused by the right parietal AVM.  \n\nOn 11/23/1991 she was admitted for weakness on the left side (more in the left arm than the left leg), a headache, and brief visual changes. Neurological exam confirmed left‑side weakness and numbness only in the left arm. A brain CT showed a 3 × 4 cm hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe. She had an attempted embolization that did not work. The radiology team had planned three separate embolizations, but during the first one, through the left middle cerebral artery, they could not reach many of the AVM vessels and stopped the procedure. She recovered but still had some left‑side sensory loss.  \n\nIn December 1992 she had an interventricular hemorrhage and was treated without surgery; she refused any future brain‑vascular procedures. In January 1993 she reconsidered a neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ."
