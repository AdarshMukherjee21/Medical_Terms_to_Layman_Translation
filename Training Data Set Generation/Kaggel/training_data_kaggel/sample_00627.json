POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation. PROCEDURES: 1. Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint. 2. Closed reduction casting of the right forearm. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine. TOURNIQUET TIME: On the left was 29 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today. The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow. After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure. Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve. At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced. This was explained to the father. The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms. All questions were answered. The father agreed to the above plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful. It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction. The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg. The Esmarch was then removed. An incision was then made. Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve. The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint. This was easily removed. The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact. The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place. After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform. The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine. The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation. The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding. Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed. The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days. The father was made aware of the intraoperative findings. All questions answered.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis**  \n- Left elbow: broken and dislocated with a piece of bone (medial epicondyle) stuck inside the joint, causing tingling in the ulnar nerve. Closed reduction was tried twice.  \n- Right forearm: broken shaft of the radius with a slight bend at the front of the bone.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis**  \n- Same as pre‑operative.\n\n**Procedures**  \n1. Open surgery to fix the left elbow bone fragment and put the arm in a long‑arm splint.  \n2. Closed reduction and casting of the right forearm.\n\n**Anesthesia**  \n- General anesthesia (the patient was asleep).  \n- 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine (local numbing drug) was used.\n\n**Tourniquet time**  \n- Left arm: 29 minutes.\n\n**Complications**  \n- None during surgery.\n\n**Drains**  \n- None.\n\n**Specimens**  \n- None.\n\n**History and physical**  \nA 13‑year‑old girl who uses her right hand fell from a swing at school around 1:30 p.m. She was first seen at another hospital where a closed reduction of her left elbow was attempted. After that, a piece of bone was still stuck inside the joint and she developed new tingling in the ulnar nerve. Because of this, she needed urgent open surgery to relieve the nerve pressure. Her right forearm fracture was also mildly angled and would be fixed at the same time. Her father was told about the risks (anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in feeling or movement, hardware problems, possible need for later removal, and ongoing nerve symptoms). He understood and agreed to the plan.\n\n**Procedure details**  \nThe girl was taken to the operating room, laid on her back, and put under general anesthesia. She received a pre‑operative antibiotic (Ancef). The left arm was cleaned and draped. Attempts to free the stuck bone fragment with gentle movements failed, so open surgery was chosen. A tourniquet was applied at 250 mmHg, then removed after the arm was wrapped. An incision was made, taking care not to damage the ulnar nerve. The bone fragment was found inside the joint and removed. The nerve was intact. The fragment was fixed back into place with a guidewire, a drill hole, and a 44‑mm, 4.5‑mm partially threaded screw with a washer. After fixation, the nerve was checked and was not pinched. The wound was washed, closed with stitches (2‑0 Vicryl and 4‑0 Monocryl), and covered with Steri‑Strips and Xeroform. The area was numbed with Marcaine. The arm was placed in a long‑arm splint with the elbow at 90° and neutral rotation. The tourniquet was released 30 minutes before dressing, and there was no significant bleeding.\n\nThe right arm was then positioned and a long‑arm cast was applied. The cast showed a very small remaining bend at the front of the radius, which is acceptable for her age. She tolerated the surgery well, was taken off the breathing tube, and moved to recovery in stable condition.\n\n**Post‑operative plan**  \nShe will stay in the hospital for 1–2 days for pain control and to check her nerves and circulation. Her father was informed of what happened during surgery and all his questions were answered."
