  "medical": "EXAM:MRI OF THE LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:Left knee pain. Twisting injury. FINDINGS: The images reveal a sizable joint effusion. The joint effusion appears to be complex with mixed signal intensity material within. The patella is slightly laterally tilted towards the left. The mid portion of the patella cartilage shows some increased signal and focal injury to the patellar cartilage is suspected. Mildly increased bone signal overlying the inferolateral portion of the patella is identified. No significant degenerative changes about the patella can be seen. The quadriceps tendon as well as the infrapatellar ligament both look intact. There is some prepatellar soft tissue edema. The bone signal shows a couple of small areas of cystic change in the proximal aspect of the tibia. NO significant areas of bone edema are appreciated. There is soft tissue edema along the lateral aspect of the knee. There is a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. The medial collateral ligament complex looks intact. A small amount of edema is identified immediately adjacent to the medial collateral ligament complex. The posterior cruciate ligament looks intact. The anterior cruciate ligament is thickened with significant increased signal. I suspect at least a high grade partial tear. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus shows some myxoid degenerative changes. The posterior horn and anterior horn of the lateral meniscus likewise shows myxoid degenerative type changes. I dont see a definite tear extending to the articular surface. IMPRESSION: Sizeable joint effusion which is complex and may contain blood products. Myxoid degenerative type changes medial and lateral meniscus with no definite evidence of a tear. Soft tissue swelling and partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. At least high grade partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament with significant thickening and increased signal of this structure. The posterior cruciate ligament is intact. Injury to the patellar cartilage as above.",
  "layman": "**MRI of the left knee (no contrast)**  \n\n**Reason for exam:** Pain in the left knee after a twisting injury.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- There is a large amount of fluid in the joint. The fluid looks mixed, possibly containing blood.  \n- The kneecap (patella) is tilted slightly to the left.  \n- The middle part of the kneecap cartilage shows a small area of damage.  \n- The bone just below the kneecap has a mild increase in signal, but no major wear or tear is seen.  \n- The tendon that pulls the thigh muscle to the kneecap (quadriceps tendon) and the ligament below the kneecap (infrapatellar ligament) are intact.  \n- Swelling is present in the soft tissue in front of the kneecap.  \n- Small cyst‑like changes are seen in the upper part of the shin bone (tibia), but no major bone swelling.  \n- Swelling is also seen along the outer side of the knee.  \n- The outer collateral ligament (lateral collateral ligament) has a partial tear.  \n- The inner collateral ligament (medial collateral ligament) is intact, with a little swelling next to it.  \n- The back cruciate ligament (PCL) is intact.  \n- The front cruciate ligament (ACL) is thickened and shows a high level of signal change, suggesting at least a severe partial tear.  \n- The back part of the inner meniscus (medial meniscus) and both the back and front parts of the outer meniscus (lateral meniscus) show degenerative changes that look like a soft, jelly‑like material. No clear tear reaching the joint surface is seen.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- Large, complex joint fluid that may contain blood.  \n- Degenerative changes in both menisci with no clear tear.  \n- Swelling and a partial tear of the outer collateral ligament.  \n- A severe partial tear of the front cruciate ligament, with thickening and increased signal.  \n- The back cruciate ligament is normal.  \n- Damage to the kneecap cartilage as described."
