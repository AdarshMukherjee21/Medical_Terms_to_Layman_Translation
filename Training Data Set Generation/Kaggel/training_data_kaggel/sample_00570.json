  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: Lower quadrant pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis are obtained. FINDINGS: Please note evaluation of the abdominal organs is secondary to the lack of intravenous contrast material. Gallstones are seen within the gallbladder lumen. No abnormal pericholecystic fluid is seen. The liver is normal in size and attenuation. The spleen is normal in size and attenuation. A 2.2 x 1.8 cm low attenuation cystic lesion appears to be originating off of the tail of the pancreas. No pancreatic ductal dilatation is seen. There is no abnormal adjacent stranding. No suspected pancreatitis is seen. The kidneys show no stone formation or hydronephrosis. The large and small bowels are normal in course and caliber. There is no evidence for obstruction. The appendix appears within normal limits. In the pelvis, the urinary bladder is unremarkable. There is a 4.2 cm cystic lesion of the right adnexal region. No free fluid, free air, or lymphadenopathy is detected. There is left basilar atelectasis. IMPRESSION: 1. A 2.2 cm low attenuation lesion is seen at the pancreatic tail. This is felt to be originating from the pancreas, a cystic pancreatic neoplasm must be considered and close interval followup versus biopsy is advised. Additionally, when the patient's creatinine improves, a contrast-enhanced study utilizing pancreatic protocol is needed. Alternatively, an MRI may be obtained. 2. Cholelithiasis. 3. Left basilar atelectasis. 4. A 4.2 cm cystic lesion of the right adnexa, correlation with pelvic ultrasound is advised.",
  "layman": "**Reason for exam:** Pain in the lower right side of the belly, along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  \n\n**Technique:** A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was done without contrast.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- Because no contrast was used, we can’t fully evaluate the abdominal organs.  \n- Gallstones are present in the gallbladder, but there is no fluid around it.  \n- The liver and spleen look normal.  \n- A 2.2 × 1.8 cm low‑density cyst‑like spot is seen near the tail of the pancreas. The pancreatic duct is not widened, and there is no sign of pancreatitis.  \n- The kidneys have no stones or swelling.  \n- The large and small intestines are normal in shape and size, with no blockage.  \n- The appendix looks normal.  \n- The bladder is normal.  \n- A 4.2 cm cyst‑like spot is seen on the right side of the pelvis (right adnexa).  \n- No free fluid, free air, or swollen lymph nodes are seen.  \n- There is collapse of the lower part of the left lung (basilar atelectasis).  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. The 2.2 cm cyst‑like spot at the pancreatic tail may be a pancreatic cystic tumor; follow‑up imaging or a biopsy is recommended. When kidney function improves, a contrast CT or MRI of the pancreas should be done.  \n2. Gallstones.  \n3. Collapse of the lower left lung.  \n4. The 4.2 cm cyst on the right side of the pelvis should be checked with a pelvic ultrasound."
