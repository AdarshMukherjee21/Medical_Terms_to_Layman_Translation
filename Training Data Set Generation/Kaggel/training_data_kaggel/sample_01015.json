  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic appendectomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 42-year-old female who presented with right lower quadrant pain. She was evaluated and found to have a CT evidence of appendicitis. She was subsequently consented for a laparoscopic appendectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the table. The abdomen was prepared and draped in usual sterile fashion. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, supraumbilical incision was made. A Veress needle was inserted. Abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg. A 5-mm port and camera placed. The abdomen was visually explored. There were no obvious abnormalities. A 15-mm port was placed in the suprapubic position in addition of 5 mm was placed in between the 1st two. Blunt dissection was used to isolate the appendix. Appendix was separated from surrounding structures. A window was created between the appendix and the mesoappendix. GIA stapler was tossed across it and fired. Mesoappendix was then taken with 2 fires of the vascular load on the GIA stapler. Appendix was placed in an Endobag and removed from the patient. Right lower quadrant was copiously irrigated. All irrigation fluids were removed. Hemostasis was verified. The 15-mm port was removed and the port site closed with 0-Vicryl in the Endoclose device. All other ports were irrigated, infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular sutures. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. Overall, the patient tolerated this well, was awakened and returned to recovery in good condition.",

A CT scan showed she had appendicitis, so she was asked to have a laparoscopic appendectomy.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nAfter the patient gave her consent, she was taken to the operating room and laid on her back. Her belly was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Once she was fully under general anesthesia, a small cut was made above the belly button. A Veress needle was inserted and the belly was inflated to 15 mmHg. A 5‑mm camera port was placed and the belly was inspected; nothing abnormal was seen. A 15‑mm port was added in the lower middle area and another 5‑mm port was placed between the first two. Using blunt dissection, the surgeon separated the appendix from nearby tissues. A space was made between the appendix and its blood supply (mesoappendix). A GIA stapler was used to cut and seal this space, and then the mesoappendix was sealed with two more stapler firings. The appendix was put into an Endobag and removed. The lower right area was washed thoroughly, and all the wash fluid was removed. The surgeon checked that there was no bleeding. The 15‑mm port was taken out and the wound was closed with 0‑Vicryl using an Endoclose device. The other ports were washed, a local anesthetic (0.25% Marcaine) was injected, and they were closed with 4‑0 Vicryl stitches under the skin. Steri‑Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient recovered well, woke up, and went to recovery in good condition."
