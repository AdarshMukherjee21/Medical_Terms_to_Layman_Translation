  "medical": "CC: Slowing of motor skills and cognitive function. HX: This 42 y/o LHM presented on 3/16/93 with gradually progressive deterioration of motor and cognitive skills over 3 years. He had difficulty holding a job. His most recent employment ended 3 years ago as he was unable to learn the correct protocols for the maintenance of a large conveyer belt. Prior to that, he was unable to hold a job in the mortgage department of a bank as could not draw and figure property assessments. For 6 months prior to presentation, he and his wife noted (his) increasingly slurred speech and slowed motor skills (i.e. dressing himself and house chores). His walk became slower and he had difficulty with balance. He became anhedonic and disinterested in social activities, and had difficulty sleeping for frequent waking and restlessness. His wife noticed &quot;fidgety movements&quot; of his hand and feet. He was placed on trials of Sertraline and Fluoxetine for depression 6 months prior to presentation by his local physician. These interventions did not appear to improve his mood and affect. MEDS: Fluoxetine. PMH: 1)Right knee arthroscopic surgery 3 yrs ago. 2)Vasectomy. FHX: Mother died age 60 of complications of Huntington Disease (dx at UIHC). MGM and two MA's also died of Huntington Disease. His 38 y/o sister has attempted suicide twice. He and his wife have 2 adopted children. SHX: unemployed. 2 years of college education. Married 22 years. ROS: No history of Dopaminergic or Antipsychotic medication use. EXAM: Vital signs normal. MS: A&O to person, place, and time. Dysarthric speech with poor respiratory control. CN: Occasional hypometric saccades in both horizontal directions. No vertical gaze abnormalities noted. Infrequent spontaneous forehead wrinkling and mouth movements. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: Full strength throughout and normal muscle tone and bulk. Mild choreiform movements were noted in the hands and feet. Sensory: unremarkable. Coord: unremarkable. Station/Gait: unremarkable, except that during tandem walking mild dystonic and choreiform movements of BUE became more apparent. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. There was no motor impersistence on tongue protrusion or hand grip. COURSE: He was thought to have early manifestations of Huntington Disease. A HCT was unremarkable. Elavil 25mg qhs was prescribed. Neuropsychologic assessment revealed mild anterograde memory loss only. His chorea gradually worsened during the following 4 years. He developed motor impersistence and more prominent slowed saccadic eye movements. His mood/affect became more labile. 6/5/96 genetic testing revealed a 45 CAg trinucleotide repeat band consistent with Huntington Disease. MRI brain, 8/23/96, showed caudate nuclei atrophy, bilaterally.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: Slow movements and thinking.\n\nHistory: A 42‑year‑old man has been getting slower and less able to think over the past three years. He lost his job at a factory because he could not learn how to keep a big conveyor belt running. Before that he could not keep a job in a bank’s mortgage department because he could not do the math and drawings needed for property assessments. For the six months before he came to the doctor, he and his wife noticed that his speech was slurring more and his movements were getting slower – he had trouble dressing himself and doing house chores. He walked more slowly and had trouble keeping his balance. He stopped enjoying social activities, slept poorly, woke up often, and seemed restless. His wife also saw that his hands and feet were fidgeting. He had been taking Sertraline and Fluoxetine for depression for six months, but his mood did not improve.\n\nMedications: Fluoxetine.\n\nPast medical history: Knee arthroscopic surgery three years ago; vasectomy.\n\nFamily history: His mother died at age 60 from complications of Huntington disease. His grandmother and two great‑aunts also died of Huntington disease. His 38‑year‑old sister has attempted suicide twice. He and his wife have two adopted children.\n\nSocial history: Unemployed. Two years of college. Married 22 years.\n\nReview of systems: No use of dopamine‑boosting or antipsychotic drugs.\n\nPhysical exam: Vital signs normal. He was alert and oriented. Speech was slurred and he had trouble controlling his breathing while speaking. Eye movements were slightly off‑target when looking left or right. He had occasional brief forehead and mouth twitches. The rest of his cranial nerve exam was normal. Muscle strength, tone, and bulk were normal. He had mild involuntary jerky movements in his hands and feet. Sensation was normal. Coordination was normal. He could stand and walk normally, but when walking heel‑to‑toe his upper arms showed more jerky movements. Reflexes were normal. Plantar responses were normal. He had no trouble holding his tongue out or gripping a hand.\n\nCourse: The doctors thought he had early Huntington disease. A complete blood count was normal. He was started on Elavil 25 mg at bedtime. A neuropsychology test showed only mild difficulty remembering new information. Over the next four years his jerky movements got worse. He developed trouble holding his hand still and his eye movements slowed more. His mood became more unstable. Genetic testing on June 5, 1996, showed 45 CAg repeats, confirming Huntington disease. An MRI of his brain on August 23, 1996, showed shrinkage of the caudate nuclei on both sides."
