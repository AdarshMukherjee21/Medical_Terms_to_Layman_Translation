  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female with two month history of low back pain and leg pain. FINDINGS: Axial scans were performed from L1 to S2 and reformatted images were obtained in the sagittal and coronal planes. Preliminary scout film demonstrates anterior end plate spondylosis at T11-12 and T12-L1. L1-2: There is normal disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, very minimal vacuum change with no posterior annular disc bulging or protrusion. Normal central canal, intervertebral neural foramina and facet joints (image #4). L2-3: There is mild decreased disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, circumferential disc protrusion measuring 4.6mm (AP) and right extraforaminal osteophyte disc complex. There is mild non-compressive right neural foraminal narrowing, minimal facet arthrosis, normal central canal and left neural foramen (image #13). L3-4: There is normal disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, and circumferential non-compressive annular disc bulging. The disc bulging flattens the ventral thecal sac and there is minimal non-compressive right neural foraminal narrowing, minimal to mild facet arthrosis with vacuum change on the right, normal central canal and left neural foramen (image #25). L4-5: There is normal disc height, minimal anterior end plate spondylosis, and posterior non-compressive annular disc bulging. There is minimal narrowing of the lateral recesses of L5, mild to moderate facet arthrosis greater on the right, normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina (image #35). L5-S1: There is severe loss of disc height with vacuum change, spondylolisthesis with 6.9mm of anterolisthesis of L5 with no disc protrusion. There is mild to moderate neural foraminal stenosis with possible neural impingement greater on the right with elongation of the neural foramina, mild facet arthrosis, and moderate degenerative change at the level of the pars interarticularis defect. Normal central canal (image #39, 40, 42). There is no significant degenerative change at the SI joints. There is moderate arteriosclerotic calcifications in the abdominal aorta and proximal common iliac arteries. IMPRESSION: T11-12, T12-L1 anterior end plate spondylosis. L1-2 anterior end plate spondylosis, and very minimal vacuum change within the disc space. L2-3 loss of disc height, anterior end plate spondylosis, circumferential disc protrusion, right extraforaminal osteophyte disc complex, non-displaced right neural foraminal narrowing, and facet arthrosis. L3-4 anterior end plate spondylosis, circumferential non-compressive annular disc bulging, facet arthrosis, with vacuum change on the right and non-compressive right neural foraminal narrowing. L4-5 anterior end plate spondylosis, posterior annular disc bulging, facet arthrosis and narrowing of the lateral recesses of L5. L5-S1 Grade I spondylolisthesis, advanced degenerative disc disease with vacuum change, neural foraminal stenosis possibly impinging exiting L5 nerve roots, degenerative change at the level of the pars interarticularis defect and facet joints. Arteriosclerotic vascular calcifications.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged woman who has had low back pain and leg pain for two months.  \n\n**Findings**  \nWe scanned her spine from the upper thoracic (T1) to the sacrum (S2) and looked at the images in side‑to‑side and front‑to‑back views. The initial quick view shows wear on the front parts of the vertebrae at T11‑T12 and T12‑L1.  \n\n- **L1‑L2**: The disc height is normal. There is mild wear on the front of the vertebrae and a very small gas pocket in the disc, but no bulging or protrusion of the disc. The spinal canal, the openings for the nerves, and the facet joints are all normal.  \n\n- **L2‑L3**: The disc height is slightly reduced. There is mild wear on the front of the vertebrae and a disc protrusion that measures 4.6 mm from front to back. A bony growth on the right side of the disc is also present. The right nerve opening is slightly narrowed but not compressed. The facet joints show a little wear. The spinal canal and the left nerve opening are normal.  \n\n- **L3‑L4**: Disc height is normal. There is mild wear on the front of the vertebrae and a non‑compressive bulge around the disc. The bulge flattens the front of the spinal canal a little. The right nerve opening is slightly narrowed, and the facet joints have mild wear, with a small gas pocket on the right. The spinal canal and left nerve opening are normal.  \n\n- **L4‑L5**: Disc height is normal. There is minimal wear on the front of the vertebrae and a non‑compressive bulge on the back of the disc. The lateral recesses of L5 are slightly narrowed. Facet joints show mild to moderate wear, especially on the right. The spinal canal and nerve openings are normal.  \n\n- **L5‑S1**: The disc height is severely lost and there is a gas pocket. L5 has slipped forward 6.9 mm (spondylolisthesis) but the disc is not protruding. The nerve openings are narrowed, especially on the right, and the nerve roots may be slightly pinched. There is mild facet joint wear and moderate degeneration where the vertebrae meet. The spinal canal is normal.  \n\nThere is no major wear on the sacroiliac joints. The abdominal aorta and the beginning of the iliac arteries show moderate hardening (arteriosclerosis).  \n\n**Impression**  \n- Wear on the front of the vertebrae at T11‑T12 and T12‑L1.  \n- L1‑L2: front vertebral wear and a very small gas pocket in the disc.  \n- L2‑L3: loss of disc height, front vertebral wear, a disc protrusion, a bony growth on the right, mild narrowing of the right nerve opening, and facet joint wear.  \n- L3‑L4: front vertebral wear, a non‑compressive disc bulge, facet joint wear, a gas pocket on the right, and mild narrowing of the right nerve opening.  \n- L4‑L5: front vertebral wear, a non‑compressive bulge on the back, facet joint wear, and slight narrowing of the L5 recesses.  \n- L5‑S1: Grade I spondylolisthesis, advanced disc degeneration with a gas pocket, nerve opening narrowing that may pinch the L5 nerve roots, degeneration at the joint where the vertebrae meet, and facet joint wear.  \n- Moderate arterial hardening."
