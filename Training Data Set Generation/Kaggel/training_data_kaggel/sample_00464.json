  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal rupture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal rupture. OPERATION PERFORMED 1. Left thoracotomy with drainage of pleural fluid collection. 2. Esophageal exploration and repair of esophageal perforation. 3. Diagnostic laparoscopy and gastrostomy. 4. Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, interpretation. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia. INDICATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of chronic esophageal stricture who is admitted with food sticking and retching. He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room. He was placed in a supine position on the operating table. After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll. Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion. After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace. The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered. The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure. The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed. Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid. Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis. The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated. A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed. There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity. The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored. The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus. It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area. The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair. After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French. These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk. The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures. The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples. The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position. A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed. A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced. The laparoscope was introduced. A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced. It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance. The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely. The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique. Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire. #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated. We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall. The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position. As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube. Sterile dressing was applied. Aspiration demonstrated gastric content. Gastrostomy tube study, with interpretation. Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, with interpretation: A gastric contrast study was then performed. Approximately 25 mL Gastrografin was introduced into the gastric lumen. The abdominal films then demonstrated intragastric content with no extravasation. After final inspection, the trocars were removed, the trocar sites were irrigated and closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures. Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied. Needle, sponge and instrument counts correct. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Esophageal rupture.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Esophageal rupture.  \n\n**Operation performed**  \n1. Opened the left chest and drained fluid from the pleural space.  \n2. Examined the esophagus and repaired the tear.  \n3. Performed a diagnostic laparoscopy and created a gastrostomy (a tube into the stomach).  \n4. Took X‑ray images of the gastrostomy tube with contrast to confirm placement.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia.  \n\n**Indications for the procedure:**  \nA 47‑year‑old man with a long‑standing narrowing of his esophagus was admitted because food was getting stuck and he was retching. A CT scan showed a rupture of the esophagus, so he was taken for a chest operation and a gastrostomy.  \n\n**Details of the procedure:**  \nAfter a thorough discussion and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room. He was laid on his back, given general anesthesia, and a double‑lumen breathing tube was placed. He was then turned onto his right side on a padded beanbag.  \n\nThe left chest was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Antibiotics were given through a vein. A left chest incision was made, and the layers of tissue were cut down to the fifth rib. The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity opened. A retractor helped keep the area clear. The sixth rib was moved slightly to allow better access.  \n\nFluid, some of which was pus‑like, was found in the left pleural space. Samples were taken for culture. The space was washed out thoroughly. When the patient exhaled, the tear in the esophagus appeared to be sealed. There was a crackling sound in the mediastinum (the area between the lungs). The mediastinum was opened and the esophagus examined. The tissue was fragile, and a tear was seen in the lower part of the esophagus. Because the tissue was too weak to hold stitches, a small flap of tissue from the chest wall was used to cover the tear. The area was washed again, which helped seal it.  \n\nAfter final cleaning, two chest tubes were placed: a right‑angled tube at the diaphragm and a straight tube behind it. They were secured to the skin with silk sutures. The chest wall was closed with sutures, the muscle layers were tied together, and the skin was closed with staples.  \n\nThe patient was turned back onto his back. A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed. A needle was inserted into the abdomen, air was pumped in to create space, and a small trocar (a tube) was placed. A camera was inserted. Another small trocar was placed on the left side. Because a feeding tube could not be passed through the narrowed esophagus, it was stopped at the point of narrowing. The stomach was inflated with air, and two small fasteners (T‑fasteners) were placed through the abdominal wall and into the stomach wall.  \n\nA skin incision was made, and the stomach was entered using a guide wire and dilators. A 18‑French gastrostomy tube was inserted and its balloon inflated inside the stomach. The balloon was pulled up to bring the stomach wall close to the abdominal wall. The fasteners were tightened and the tube was secured to the skin. A sterile dressing was applied. The tube was checked by suctioning stomach contents.  \n\n**Gastrostomy tube study:**  \nAbout 25 mL of Gastrografin (contrast) was injected into the tube. X‑ray films of the abdomen showed the contrast inside the stomach with no leakage.  \n\nAfter the procedure, the trocars were removed, the sites were cleaned, and sutured with 4‑0 Vicryl. Steri‑strips and dressings were applied. All instruments and sponges were counted correctly.  \n\n**Estimated blood loss:** Minimal.  \n**Complications:** None."
