  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Positive peptic ulcer disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastritis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photography and biopsy. GROSS FINDINGS: The patient had a history of peptic ulcer disease, epigastric abdominal pain x2 months, being evaluated at this time for ulcer disease. Upon endoscopy, gastroesophageal junction was at 40 cm, no esophageal tumor, varices, strictures, masses, or no reflux esophagitis was noted. Examination of the stomach reveals mild inflammation of the antrum of the stomach, no ulcers, erosions, tumors, or masses. The profundus and the cardia of the stomach were unremarkable. The pylorus was concentric. The duodenal bulb and sweep with no inflammation, tumors, or masses. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient taken to the Endoscopy Suite, prepped and draped in the left lateral decubitus position. She was given IV sedation using Demerol and Versed. Olympus videoscope was inserted in the hypopharynx, upon deglutition passed into the esophagus. Using air insufflation, the scope was advanced down through the esophagus into the stomach along the greater curvature of the stomach to the pylorus to the duodenal bulb and sweep. The above gross findings noted. The panendoscope was withdrawn back from the stomach, deflected upon itself. The lesser curve fundus and cardiac were well visualized. Upon examination of these areas, panendoscope was returned to midline. Photographs and biopsies were obtained of the antrum of the stomach. Air was aspirated from the stomach and panendoscope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining the lumen of the bowel. Photographs and biopsies were obtained as appropriate. The patient is sent to recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The patient had a peptic ulcer.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The patient has gastritis.  \n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: An upper endoscopy (scope into the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine) with pictures and tissue samples taken.  \n\nGROSS FINDINGS: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease and has had upper abdominal pain for about two months. The scope showed the junction between the esophagus and stomach at 40 cm. No tumors, varices, strictures, masses, or signs of reflux esophagitis were seen. In the stomach, the lower part (antrum) had mild inflammation but no ulcers, erosions, tumors, or masses. The deeper part (fundus) and the cardia were normal. The pylorus (opening to the small intestine) was smooth. The first part of the small intestine (duodenal bulb and sweep) showed no inflammation, tumors, or masses.  \n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the endoscopy room, positioned on her left side, and given IV sedation with Demerol and Versed. A video scope was inserted through the throat, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. Air was pumped into the stomach to help see the inside. The scope was moved along the outer curve of the stomach to the pylorus and into the duodenal bulb and sweep, where the findings described above were seen. The scope was then pulled back out of the stomach, turned to view the inner curve, fundus, and cardia, and then returned to the middle line. Pictures were taken and tissue samples were taken from the antrum of the stomach. Air was removed from the stomach and the scope was slowly withdrawn while carefully looking at the inside of the bowel. Additional pictures and tissue samples were taken as needed. The patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
