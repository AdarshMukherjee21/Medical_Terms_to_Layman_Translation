  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left calcaneal valgus split. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left calcaneal valgus split. PROCEDURES: 1. Left calcaneal lengthening osteotomy with allograft. 2. Partial plantar fasciotomy. 3. Posterior subtalar and tibiotalar capsulotomy. 4. Short leg cast placed. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. TOURNIQUET TIME: 69 minutes. The patient in local anesthetic of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine plain. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 13-year-old female who had previous bilateral feet correction at 1 year of age. Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain. Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot. Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother. Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures. The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months. All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A bump was placed underneath the left buttock. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion. The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot. This was marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon. Extremity was wrapped in Esmarch. Tourniquet inflation was noted to be 250 mmHg. Decision was then made to protect the sural nerve. There was one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it was subsequently sharply ligated because it was in the way. Dissection was carried down to Achilles tendon, which was subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh. Proximal end was tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral. Dissection was then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally. At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused. The area between the anterior and middle facets were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy. This was performed with a saw. After a partial plantar fasciotomy was performed, this was released off an abductor digiti minimi. The osteotomy was completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader. A tricortical allograft was then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area. Final positioning was checked with multiple views of fluoroscopy. It was subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly. A pin was subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline. The Achilles was repaired with this tie. Please note during the case, it was noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening. A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints were performed with increased 10 degrees of dorsiflexion. Wound was then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl. The surgical field was irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case. The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform. Skin was dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's. Everything was wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril. The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes. A short-leg cast was then placed with good return of capillary refill to his toes. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be hospitalized overnight for elevation, ice packs, neurovascular checks, and pain control. The patient to be strict nonweightbearing. We will arrange for her to get a wheelchair. The patient will then follow up in about 10 to 14 days for a cast check, as well as pain control. The patient will need an AFO script at that time. Intraoperative findings are relayed to the parents.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:**  \nThe left heel (calcaneus) was turned outward (valgus) and split.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:**  \nSame as pre‑operative: left heel valgus split.\n\n**Procedures performed:**  \n1. Lengthening of the left heel bone with a bone graft from a donor.  \n2. Cutting part of the plantar fascia (the tissue on the bottom of the foot).  \n3. Opening the back part of the subtalar and ankle joints.  \n4. A short‑leg cast was put on.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nThe patient was put under general anesthesia (sleeping drug).  \nA tourniquet (blood‑stopper) was used for 69 minutes.  \nThe patient also received 20 mL of 0.25 % Marcaine (local anesthetic).\n\n**Complications:**  \nNone during the operation.\n\n**Drains:**  \nNone.\n\n**Specimens:**  \nNone.\n\n**History and physical exam:**  \nThe patient is a 13‑year‑old girl who had both feet corrected when she was 1 year old. Since then she has developed a large outward heel deformity and a lot of pain. X‑rays show the arch of the foot has collapsed and the foot is turned outward. Because of her symptoms, surgery was recommended to straighten the heel and lengthen the Achilles tendon. Her mother was told about the risks (anesthesia, infection, bleeding, numbness, hardware problems, need for later surgery, possible failure to heal or correct the deformity, and possible need for more surgery). She was told she would have to stay off weight for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months. All questions were answered and her parents agreed to the plan.\n\n**Description of the procedure:**  \nThe girl was taken to the operating room, laid on her back, and put under general anesthesia. She received a pre‑operative antibiotic (Ancef). A cushion was placed under her left buttock. A non‑sterile tourniquet was put on the upper part of her left thigh. The foot was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The surgeon marked the old incision on the side of the foot and extended it up the Achilles tendon. The leg was wrapped with an Esmarch bandage. The tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. The surgeon protected the sural nerve; one small sensory nerve branch crossed the field and was tied off because it was in the way. The dissection went down to the Achilles tendon, which was shortened by cutting the lower half of the tendon down the side of the thigh. The top end was tied with a strong suture and then re‑attached to the heel in a neutral position. The surgeon then worked along the outer edge of the foot, identified the peroneus longus and the valgus tendons, pulled them back, and noted that the calcaneocuboid joint was fused. The area between the front and middle facets of the foot was prepared for the bone cut. A saw was used to make the cut. After a partial plantar fascia cut, the fascia was released from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The bone cut was finished with an osteotome and the gap was widened with a spreader. A tricortical bone graft from a donor was shaped and pressed into the gap. The final position was checked with X‑ray images. The graft was fixed with a 0.94 mm K‑wire that was drilled from the heel forward. The wire was bent and cut short at the skin level. The wound was washed with normal saline. The Achilles tendon was repaired with the tie. The surgeon noted that the patient still had stiffness even after the Achilles lengthening, so a posterior capsulotomy (opening) of the ankle and subtalar joints was performed, allowing an extra 10° of upward foot movement. The wound was closed with #2‑0 Vicryl and #4‑0 Monocryl sutures. The area was washed with 0.25 % Marcaine and more Marcaine was injected at the end. The wound was clean and dry, covered with Steri‑Strips and Xeroform. The skin was wrapped with Xeroform and 4 × 4 gauze, then covered with sterile Webril gauze. The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes. A short‑leg cast was applied and the toes had good capillary refill. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was taken to recovery in stable condition.\n\n**Post‑operative plan:**  \nThe patient will stay overnight for elevation, ice packs, neuro‑vascular checks, and pain control. She must stay off weight. A wheelchair will be arranged. She will return in 10–14 days for a cast check and pain management. An ankle‑foot orthosis (AFO) prescription will be given then. The parents were informed of what was found during surgery."
