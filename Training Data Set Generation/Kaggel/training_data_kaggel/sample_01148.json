  "medical": "EXAM: CT chest with contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: Pneumonia, chest pain, short of breath, and coughing up blood. TECHNIQUE: Postcontrast CT chest 100 mL of Isovue-300 contrast. FINDINGS: This study demonstrates a small region of coalescent infiltrates/consolidation in the anterior right upper lobe. There are linear fibrotic or atelectatic changes associated with this. Recommend followup to ensure resolution. There is left apical scarring. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is lingular and right middle lobe mild atelectasis or fibrosis. Examination of the mediastinal windows disclosed normal inferior thyroid. Cardiac and aortic contours are unremarkable aside from mild atherosclerosis. The heart is not enlarged. There is no pathologic adenopathy identified in the chest including the bilateral axillary and hilar regions. Very limited assessment of the upper abdomen demonstrates no definite abnormalities. There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: 1.Anterior small right upper lobe infiltrate/consolidation. Recommend followup to ensure resolution given its consolidated appearance. 2.Bilateral atelectasis versus fibrosis.",
  "layman": "CT scan of the chest with contrast was done because the patient had pneumonia, chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing up blood. The scan used 100 mL of contrast. The results show a small area of lung tissue that looks cloudy or solid in the front part of the right upper lung. There are some scar‑like or collapsed changes around it, so a follow‑up scan is suggested to make sure it improves. There is scar tissue at the top of the left lung. No fluid around the lungs or collapsed lung. Mild collapse or scar tissue is also seen in the lingula and right middle lung. The thyroid and heart look normal, except for mild artery hardening. The heart size is normal. No enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the chest, including the armpits and near the lungs. The upper abdomen looks normal. There are mild age‑related changes in the upper back bones. The main findings are the small cloudy area in the right upper lung and mild collapse or scar tissue on both sides."
