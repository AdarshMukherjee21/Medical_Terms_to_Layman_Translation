  "medical": "PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Pending pathology. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with multiple biopsies, including terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 28-year-old female with history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. Colonoscopy is indicated to evaluate for etiology. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite with IV fluids being administered. She was given a total of 300 mcg of fentanyl and 15 mg of Versed, titrated for conscious IV sedation. Her heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the procedure. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. The procedure began with a digital rectal examination. The scope was then placed through the anus and advanced without difficulty to the terminal ileum. There was what appeared to be some inflammation of the terminal ileum. This was biopsied. The scope was then withdrawn into the cecum, where biopsies were obtained. The scope was then slowly withdrawn throughout the entire length of the colon. The prep was adequate, but multiple syringes of irrigation were necessary to irrigate out some of the residual stool and allow for better visualization of the colonic mucosa. There was an area of induration and inflammation at the hepatic flexure. This was biopsied. The scope was again withdrawn throughout the length of the colon. There was also some area of inflammation in the sigmoid colon with narrowing. Again, these findings were seen on the way in with the colonoscope and were not due to scope trauma or the procedure itself. Further biopsies were obtained of the sigmoid colon in this area of narrowing. Total biopsies included terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon. The scope was then withdrawn into the rectum. Retroflexion showed a normal-appearing anal canal with no internal hemorrhoids or fissures. Other than the areas of inflammation, there were no other abnormalities identified, no AV malformations, no polyps, no diverticulum. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate postprocedure complications.",
  "layman": "**Before the procedure:** The doctor suspected the patient had abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever.  \n**After the procedure:** The final diagnosis will wait for the pathology results.\n\n**What was done:** A colonoscopy was performed and several tissue samples (biopsies) were taken from the end of the small intestine (terminal ileum), the beginning of the large intestine (cecum), the bend near the liver (hepatic flexure), and the lower part of the colon (sigmoid colon).\n\n**Why it was done:** The patient is a 28‑year‑old woman who has been having abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. The colonoscopy was needed to find out what was causing these symptoms.\n\n**How the procedure went:**  \n- The patient was taken to the endoscopy room and given IV fluids.  \n- She received 300 mcg of fentanyl and 15 mg of Versed for conscious sedation.  \n- Her heart rate, rhythm, blood pressure, breathing, and oxygen level were checked the whole time.  \n- She stayed stable during the procedure.  \n\nThe doctor first did a digital rectal exam. Then the scope was inserted through the anus and advanced easily to the terminal ileum, where some inflammation was seen and a biopsy was taken.  \nThe scope was pulled back to the cecum and more biopsies were taken.  \nWhile withdrawing the scope, the doctor cleaned the colon with several syringes of water to remove leftover stool and see the lining better.  \nAn area of thickening and inflammation was found at the hepatic flexure and was biopsied.  \nThe scope was withdrawn again, and inflammation with narrowing was seen in the sigmoid colon. These changes were present before the scope entered and were not caused by the procedure. Additional biopsies were taken from this narrowed area.  \n\nAll biopsies were from the terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon.  \nWhen the scope was pulled back into the rectum, a retroflex view showed a normal anal canal with no hemorrhoids or fissures.  \nOther than the inflamed spots, no other problems were seen—no abnormal blood vessels, no polyps, and no diverticula.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and had no immediate complications."
