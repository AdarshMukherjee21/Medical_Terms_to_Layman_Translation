  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture. OPERATION: Intramedullary rod in the left hip using the Synthes trochanteric fixation nail measuring 11 x 130 degrees with an 85-mm helical blade. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 50 mL. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: The patient suffered a fall at which time she was taken to the emergency room with pain in the lower extremities. She was diagnosed with displaced left subcapital hip fracture, now was asked to consult. With this diagnosis, she was indicated the above-noted procedure. This procedure as well as alternatives to this procedure was discussed at length with the patient and her son, who has the power of attorney, and they understood them well. Risks and benefits were also discussed. Risks include bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerves, risk of further surgery, chronic pain, restricted range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of malunion, risk of nonunion, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for altered activities and altered gait, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. She understood these well and consented, and the son signed the consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The patient was then placed in fracture boots and manipulated under fluoroscopic control until we could obtain near anatomic alignment. External positions were felt to be present. At this point, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A guidewire was then placed percutaneously into the tip of the greater trochanter and a small incision was made overlying the guidewire. An overlying drill was inserted to the proper depths. A Synthes 11 x 130 degrees trochanteric fixation that was chosen was placed into the intramedullary canal to the proper depth. Proper rotation was obtained and the guide for the helical blade was inserted. A small incision was made for this as well. A guidewire was inserted and felt to be in proper position, in the posterior aspect of the femoral head, lateral, and the center position on AP. This placed the proper depths and lengths better. The outer cortex was enlarged and an 85-mm helical blade was attached to the proper depths and proper fixation was done. Appropriate size screw was then tightened down. At this point, a distal guide was then placed and drilled across both the cortices. Length was better. Appropriate size screw was then inserted. Proper size and fit of the distal screw was also noted. At this point, on fluoroscopic control, it was confirming in AP and lateral direction. We did a near anatomical alignment to the fracture site and all hardware was properly fixed. Proper size and fit was noted. Excellent bony approximation was noted. At this point, both wounds were thoroughly irrigated, hemostasis confirmed, and closure was then begun. The fascial layers were then reapproximated using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight manner, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples. The area was then infiltrated with a mixture of a 0.25% Marcaine with Epinephrine and 1% plain lidocaine. Sterile dressing was then applied. No complication was encountered throughout the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "**Before the surgery:**  \nThe patient had a broken left thigh bone just below the hip (subtrochanteric fracture).  \n\n**After the surgery:**  \nThe same fracture was fixed.  \n\n**What was done:**  \nAn intramedullary rod (a metal stick that goes inside the bone) was inserted into the left hip. The rod used was a Synthes trochanteric fixation nail that is 11 mm wide and 130 mm long, with an 85‑mm helical blade that locks into the bone.  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n**Tourniquet:** None.  \n**Estimated blood loss:** 50 mL.  \n**Anesthesia:** General (the patient was asleep).  \n\n**Why the surgery was needed:**  \nThe patient fell and went to the emergency room with pain in her legs. She was diagnosed with a displaced left hip fracture. She and her son (who has power of attorney) were told about the surgery and other options. They understood the risks and benefits, which include bleeding, infection, nerve or blood vessel damage, need for more surgery, chronic pain, limited movement, ongoing discomfort, improper healing, and serious complications such as blood clots, lung problems, heart attack, or death. She gave consent and her son signed the paperwork.  \n\n**How the surgery was performed:**  \n1. The patient was put on the operating table and put under general anesthesia.  \n2. She was fitted with fracture boots and the surgeon used X‑ray guidance to line up the broken bone as close to normal as possible.  \n3. The left hip and leg were cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n4. A thin wire was inserted through the skin to the tip of the greater trochanter (top of the thigh bone). A small cut was made over the wire.  \n5. A drill was used to make a path for the nail.  \n6. The 11 mm × 130 mm Synthes nail was inserted into the bone to the correct depth. The nail was rotated into the right position.  \n7. A second small cut was made for the helical blade. A guidewire was placed into the back part of the femoral head, then the blade was attached and driven into the bone.  \n8. A screw was tightened to hold the blade.  \n9. A guide was placed at the lower end of the bone, drilled through both outer layers, and a screw was inserted to lock the nail in place.  \n10. X‑ray images (front and side views) confirmed the bone was aligned and all hardware was secure.  \n11. The wounds were washed, bleeding stopped, and the incisions were closed. The deeper layers were stitched with #1 Vicryl in a figure‑of‑eight pattern, the skin was closed with staples, and a local anesthetic (Marcaine with epinephrine and plain lidocaine) was injected.  \n12. A sterile dressing was applied.  \n\nNo problems occurred during the operation. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was moved to the recovery room in stable condition."
