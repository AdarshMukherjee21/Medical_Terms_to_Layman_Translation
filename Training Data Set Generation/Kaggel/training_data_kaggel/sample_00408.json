  "medical": "INDICATION: Lung carcinoma. Whole body PET scanning was performed with 11 mCi of 18 FDG. Axial, coronal and sagittal imaging was performed over the neck, chest abdomen and pelvis. FINDINGS: There is normal physiologic activity identified in the myocardium, liver, spleen, ureters, kidneys and bladder. There is abnormal FDG-avid activity identified in the posterior left paraspinal region best seen on axial images 245-257 with an SUV of 3.8, no definite bone lesion is identified on the CT scan or the bone scan dated 08/14/2007 (It may be purely lytic). Additionally there is a significant area of activity corresponding to a mass in the region of the left hilum that is visible on the CT scan with an SUV of 18.1, the adjacent atelectasis as likely post obstructive in nature. Additionally, although there is no definite lesion identified on CT , there is a tiny satellite nodule in the left upper lobe that is hypermetabolic with an SUV of 5.0. The spiculated density seen in the right upper lobe on the CT scan does not demonstrate FDG activity on this PET scan. There is a hypermetabolic lymph node identified in the aorta pulmonary window with an SUV of 3.7 in the mediastinum. IMPRESSION: No prior PET scans for comparison, there is a large lesion identified in the area of the left hilum with an SUV of 18.1 likely causing the obstructive atelectasis seen on the CT scan. There is a tiny satellite area of hypermetabolic FDG in the left upper lobe adjacent to the pleura with an SUV of 5.0. There is a area of hypermetabolic activity in the left paraspinal soft tissues at the level of the lung apices which may represent a focal bone lesion. However no lesion is identified on bone scan or CT scan. There is a hypermetabolic lymph node identified. The aorta pulmonary window with a corresponding finding on CT scan with an SUV of 3.7.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the scan:** Lung cancer.  \n**What was done:** A whole‑body PET scan was performed using 11 mCi of the radioactive sugar 18‑FDG. Images were taken in three planes (axial, coronal, sagittal) of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n\n**What we saw:**  \n- Normal activity in the heart, liver, spleen, tubes that carry urine (ureters), kidneys, and bladder.  \n- A spot of increased activity behind the left side of the spine (posterior left paraspinal area) on axial images 245‑257, with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 3.8. No clear bone problem was seen on the CT or a bone scan from 08/14/2007, so it might be a purely lytic change.  \n- A large area of activity in the left lung hilum (where the main airway and vessels enter the lung) that is visible on CT, with an SUV of 18.1. This likely explains the collapsed lung tissue (atelectasis) seen on CT, probably because the mass is blocking the airway.  \n- A very small, bright spot in the left upper lobe of the lung that is not clearly seen on CT but shows high metabolic activity, SUV 5.0.  \n- A spiculated (spiky) density in the right upper lobe seen on CT does not show any activity on the PET scan.  \n- A bright lymph node in the mediastinum (area around the heart and major vessels) with an SUV of 3.7, seen in the aorta‑pulmonary window and confirmed on CT.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No previous PET scans to compare with.  \n- A large, highly active mass in the left lung hilum (SUV 18.1) is probably causing the collapsed lung tissue.  \n- A tiny, highly active spot in the left upper lobe (SUV 5.0) is present.  \n- Increased activity behind the left spine (SUV 3.8) may be a bone lesion, but no bone or CT abnormality was found.  \n- One active lymph node in the mediastinum (SUV 3.7) is noted."
