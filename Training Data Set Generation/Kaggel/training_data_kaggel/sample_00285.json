  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice. He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital. A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases. The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas. The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent. This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct. A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage. The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable. He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests. Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission. This responded to Zofran. It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself. At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000. His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3. His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8. He was tolerating a regular diet. The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale. The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary. He will be further managed for his diabetes there. The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings. I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient. Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity. The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n. 2. Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d. 3. Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus. 4. Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary. 5. The patient had initially been on enalapril here. His hypertension will be managed by Dr. X as well. PLAN: The patient should return for repeat ERCP if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever, increased bilirubin, worsening pain. In the meantime, he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per Dr. X.",
  "layman": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 48‑year‑old man has had belly pain since October of last year, lost 30 pounds, and then developed yellowing of his skin and eyes. He had upper‑abdominal pain and was admitted to the hospital. A detailed CT scan showed a 4 × 3 × 2 cm tumor in the pancreas, swollen lymph nodes, and ring‑shaped spots in the liver that look like cancer spread. He also had a possible fluid collection (pseudocyst) in the tail of the pancreas. On April 4, 2007 he had an ERCP (a procedure that looks inside the bile and pancreatic ducts) and a stent was placed. The scan showed a narrowed pancreatic duct and a narrowed bile duct. A 10‑French × 9 cm stent was put in, which allowed good drainage. The next morning he felt much better. His bilirubin and other liver tests also dropped a bit. He had a lot of nausea while in the hospital; Zofran helped, and after the stent he was less nauseous and responded better to Phenergan. At discharge his blood counts were: white cells 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32, MCV 79, platelets 585,000. Electrolytes: sodium 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO₂ 27. Kidney and liver: BUN 8, creatinine 0.3, bilirubin 17.1, alkaline phosphatase 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8, albumin 3.8. He could eat a regular diet. He had taken oral diabetes medicine before, but in the hospital he was on an insulin sliding scale. He will be sent back to Pelican Bay to be cared for by Dr. X, who will also manage his diabetes. He will also have end‑of‑life discussions. I talked with him about chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. It can help a little but can also cause side effects. He will think about it and talk more with Dr. X.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Phenergan 25 mg every 6 hours as needed\n2. Duragesic patch 100 mcg every 3 days\n3. Benadryl 25‑50 mg by mouth four times a day for itching\n4. The insulin sliding scale will stop at discharge and will start again when he arrives at Pelican Bay\n5. He was on enalapril here; Dr. X will manage his high blood pressure.\n\nPLAN: If he shows signs that the stent is blocked—such as fever, higher bilirubin, or worse pain—he should return for another ERCP. In the meantime, he should keep eating a regular diet and stay active as advised by Dr. X."
