  "medical": "EXAM:MRI/LOW EX NOT JNT RT W/O CONTRAST CLINICAL:Pain and swelling in the right foot, peroneal tendon tear. FINDINGS: Contours of marrow signal patterns of the regional bones are within normal range treating there is increased T2 signal within the soft tissues at the lateral margin of the cuboid bone. A small effusion is noted within the peroneal tendon sheath. There is a 3mm slight separation of the distal tip of the peroneus longus tendon from the lateral margin of the cuboid bone, consistent with an avulsion. There is no sign of cuboid fracture. The fifth metatarsal base appears intact. The calcaneus is also normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with an avulsion of the peroneus longus tendon from the insertion on the lateral aspect of cuboid bone.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the lower right foot without contrast  \nCLINICAL: Pain and swelling in the right foot, suspected tear of the peroneal tendon.  \n\nFINDINGS: The bone marrow looks normal. There is increased signal (a sign of fluid or inflammation) in the soft tissues next to the cuboid bone on the outer side. A small amount of fluid is seen in the sheath around the peroneal tendon. The tip of the peroneus longus tendon is slightly pulled away—about 3 mm—from the outer edge of the cuboid bone, which is an avulsion injury. There is no fracture of the cuboid bone. The base of the fifth metatarsal and the heel bone (calcaneus) appear normal.  \n\nIMPRESSION: The results show an avulsion of the peroneus longus tendon from its attachment on the outer side of the cuboid bone."
