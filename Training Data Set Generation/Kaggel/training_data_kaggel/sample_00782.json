  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few-month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves. Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago. This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time. She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms. She is almost asymptomatic at present. She dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs. She has had no associated weakness. On brief examination, straight leg raising is normal. The patient is obese. There is mild decreased vibration and light touch in distal lower extremities. Strength is full and symmetric. Deep tendon reflexes at the knees are 2+ and symmetric and absent at the ankles. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral sural sensory responses are absent. Bilateral superficial sensory responses are present, but mildly reduced. The right radial sensory response is normal. The right common peroneal and tibial motor responses are normal. Bilateral H-reflexes are absent. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle. It revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle. Lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: 1. A very mild, purely sensory length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. 2. Mild bilateral L5 nerve root irritation. There is no evidence of active radiculopathy. Based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral L5 radiculopathies. Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil. I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return. With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes. However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following: Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer.",
  "layman": "**History:**  \nA 52‑year‑old woman with diet‑controlled diabetes, arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps has had numbness in both big toes and up the outer sides of both calves for a few months. The numbness got much worse about a month ago, especially after standing or walking. She was started on amitriptyline (Elavil), which has made her symptoms almost disappear. She still has long‑standing lower back pain, but it does not spread into her legs. She has no weakness. A quick exam showed normal straight‑leg‑raise tests. She is obese. Her sense of vibration and light touch is a little weaker in the lower legs. Muscle strength is normal and the same on both sides. Knee reflexes are normal and a little brisk; ankle reflexes are absent.\n\n**Nerve conduction studies:**  \n- Sensory signals from the sural nerves (in the lower leg) are missing on both sides.  \n- Sensory signals from the superficial nerves are present but a bit weaker.  \n- The right radial nerve sensory signal is normal.  \n- Motor signals from the right common peroneal and tibial nerves are normal.  \n- H‑reflexes (a test of nerve reflexes) are missing on both sides.\n\n**Needle EMG:**  \nA needle test was done on the right leg and on back muscles near the lower spine, and on the left tibialis posterior muscle. It showed:\n- Extra muscle activity when the right tibialis posterior muscle was first touched.  \n- Signs of mild, long‑term loss of nerve supply in both peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle.  \n- The back muscles were too painful to test properly.\n\n**Impression:**  \nThe electrical tests are abnormal and show:\n1. A very mild, sensory‑only nerve problem that gets worse farther from the body.  \n2. Mild irritation of the L5 nerve roots on both sides.  \nThere is no sign of active nerve root pain. The new symptoms fit with mild, bilateral L5 nerve root irritation. The symptoms have almost completely gone after starting Elavil.  \nIf the symptoms come back, an MRI of the lower spine is recommended.  \nThe mild nerve problem is likely related to her early diabetes or high blood sugar, but other causes should be checked with the following tests: fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis, and Lyme disease titer."
