Stenosing tenosynovitis of right middle finger (trigger finger). PROCEDURES: 1. Endoscopic release of left transverse carpal ligament. 2. Steroid injection, stenosing tenosynovitis of right middle finger. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia applied by surgeon. TOURNIQUET TIME: Left upper extremity was 15 minutes. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: With the patient under adequate monitored anesthesia, the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated. The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg. Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray. A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin. Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery. A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned. Care was taken to protect the underlying contents. A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface. Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate. The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision. The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal. Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end. The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window. The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision. After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted. Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished. One mL of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free. The wound was then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-strips. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well. Attention was turned to the right palm where after a sterile prep, the right middle finger flexor sheath was injected with 0.5 mL of 1% plain Xylocaine and 0.5 mL of Depo-Medrol 40 mg/mL. A Band-Aid dressing was then applied. The patient was then awakened from the anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",

Left carpal tunnel syndrome.  \n2. Trigger finger of the right middle finger.  \n\n**Procedures**  \n1. Endoscopic release of the left transverse carpal ligament.  \n2. Steroid injection for trigger finger of the right middle finger.  \n\n**Anesthesia**  \nMonitored anesthesia care with a regional block given by the surgeon.  \n\n**Tourniquet time**  \n15 minutes on the left arm.  \n\n**Operative details**  \n\nThe patient was given adequate monitored anesthesia. The left arm was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Blood was removed from the arm and a tourniquet was set to 290 mmHg. Lines were drawn on the left palm to locate the middle finger area. A small horizontal cut was made between the two forearm muscles (FCR and FCU) just above the skin line between the palm and forearm. Gentle cutting exposed the outer layer of the forearm. Bleeding was stopped with a bipolar cautery device. A small opening was made in this outer layer, taking care not to damage what lay underneath.  \n\nA special elevator was used to feel the underside of the transverse carpal ligament and to lift the synovial tissue away from it. The surgeon then used a “Hood of Hamate” probe to feel the hamate bone. The Agee Inside Job instrument was inserted through the small incision. The ligament was seen through the portal. By pressing from the palm side, the ligament was held against the portal while the instrument was moved along the ligament to its far end. The far end was found in the opening made earlier. The blade of the instrument lifted the ligament, and the instrument was pulled back, cutting the ligament under direct vision. After the ligament was fully cut, the instrument was re‑inserted. The edges of the ligament were identified and the release was finished. One milliliter of Celestone (a steroid) was injected into the carpal tunnel and then washed out. The wound was closed with a running 3‑0 Prolene stitch under the skin. Steri‑strips and a sterile dressing were applied. The tourniquet was released. The patient woke up from anesthesia and was sent to recovery in good condition.  \n\nThe surgeon then turned to the right hand. After cleaning the area, the flexor sheath of the right middle finger was injected with 0.5 mL of 1 % plain Xylocaine and 0.5 mL of Depo‑Medrol (40 mg/mL). A Band‑Aid was applied. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and sent to recovery in satisfactory condition."
