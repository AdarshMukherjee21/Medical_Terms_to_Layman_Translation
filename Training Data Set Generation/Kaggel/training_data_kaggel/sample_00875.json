The patient's symptoms have been persistent and had gotten worse with subjective weakness of the right upper extremity since its onset for several weeks now.

The patient had imaging studies that showed evidence of cervical spondylosis with herniated disk and stenosis at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7. The patient underwent liver surgery and postoperatively her main issue was that of some degree of on and off right shoulder pain and some operative site soreness, which was treated well with IV morphine.
