  "medical": "EEG during wakefulness demonstrates background activity consisting of beta rhythms in the 12- to 14-Hz range. Some EKG artifact is noted intermittently. The background activity appears to be bilaterally symmetric and consistent throughout. The recording time is 22 minutes and 57 seconds. There is some attenuation of the background activity during drowsiness. Some late sleep is recorded. Photic stimulation induced no abnormal changes in the record. No paroxysmal or focal abnormalities are seen in this recording. IMPRESSION: EEG during wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep with synchronous video monitoring demonstrated no evidence of focal or epileptogenic activity.",
  "layman": "The EEG taken while the person was awake shows normal background brain waves in the 12‑14 Hz range. A few brief EKG artifacts appear. The waves look the same on both sides of the brain and stay steady throughout the test. The recording lasted 22 minutes and 57 seconds. When the person became drowsy, the background waves slowed a bit. Some brief sleep was also recorded. Light‑stimulus testing (photic stimulation) did not cause any abnormal changes. No sudden or localized abnormal waves were seen. \n\n**Impression:** The EEG, recorded while the person was awake, drowsy, and sleeping, and watched with video, showed no signs of focal or seizure‑related activity."
