  "medical": "INDICATIONS: Ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post inferior wall myocardial infarction, status post left anterior descending PTCA and stenting. PROCEDURE DONE: Adenosine Myoview stress test. STRESS ECG RESULTS: The patient was stressed by intravenous adenosine, 140 mcg/kg/minute infused over four minutes. The baseline resting electrocardiogram revealed an electronic pacemaker depolarizing the ventricles regularly at a rate of 70 beats per minute. Underlying atrial fibrillation noted, very wide QRS complexes. The heart rate remained unchanged at 70 beats per minute as the blood pressure decreased from 140/80 to 110/70 with adenosine infusion. MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING: Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging was carried out with 10.9 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview. Adenosine infusion myocardial perfusion imaging and gated scan were carried out with 30 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview. The lung heart ratio is 0.34. A large transmural inferoseptal and apical perfusion defect of severe degree noted. No evidence of perfusion abnormality along the left anterior descending territory, which was the site of a PTCA and stenting a year ago. The gated scan revealed paradoxical septal motion, dyskinetic apical segment, severe inferior hypokinesis, mild to moderate anterolateral and basilar hypokinesis. Ejection fraction is 27%. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Findings consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Paradoxical septal motion consistent with abnormal ventricular depolarization related to right ventricular apical position of VVI pacemaker. Apical dyskinesis, severe inferior hypokinesis, mild to moderate anterolateral and basilar hypokinesis. Ejection fraction of 27%. 2. Large inferoseptal and apical transmural scar. 3. No evidence of adenosine-induced myocardial ischemia. Specifically no reversible perfusion abnormalities seen in the territory of the left anterior descending, which underwent stenting a year ago.",
  "layman": "**Indications:**  \nThe patient has heart muscle disease caused by poor blood flow (ischemic cardiomyopathy). The patient had a heart attack in the lower part of the heart wall and later had a procedure (PTCA) and stent placed in the left anterior descending artery.\n\n**Procedure performed:**  \nA stress test using the drug adenosine (Adenosine Myoview).\n\n**Stress ECG results:**  \nAdenosine was given at 140 micrograms per kilogram per minute for four minutes.  \nAt rest, the patient’s pacemaker was pacing the heart at a steady 70 beats per minute. The patient also had atrial fibrillation and very wide QRS complexes on the ECG.  \nDuring the drug infusion the heart rate stayed at 70 beats per minute, but blood pressure fell from 140/80 to 110/70.\n\n**Myocardial perfusion imaging:**  \nA resting scan was done with 10.9 mCi of Tc‑99m Myoview.  \nDuring adenosine infusion a perfusion scan and a gated scan were done with 30 mCi of Tc‑99m Myoview.  \nThe lung‑to‑heart ratio was 0.34.  \nA large, full‑thickness scar was seen in the lower front and front‑bottom (inferoseptal and apical) parts of the heart.  \nThere was no scar or abnormal blood flow in the area of the left anterior descending artery, where the stent was placed a year ago.  \nThe gated scan showed abnormal movement of the heart wall: the septum moved in the wrong direction, the apex of the heart moved poorly, the lower part of the heart was very weak, and the front‑side and base of the heart were mildly to moderately weak.  \nThe ejection fraction (the percentage of blood pumped out of the heart each beat) was 27%.\n\n**Conclusions:**  \n1. The findings match ischemic heart disease. The abnormal septum movement is due to the pacemaker’s right‑ventricle apical position. The apex moves poorly, the lower part of the heart is severely weak, and the front‑side and base are mildly to moderately weak. Ejection fraction is 27%.  \n2. There is a large full‑thickness scar in the lower front and front‑bottom areas.  \n3. No evidence that adenosine caused new heart muscle ischemia. There were no reversible blood‑flow problems in the left anterior descending artery, which had a stent placed a year ago."
