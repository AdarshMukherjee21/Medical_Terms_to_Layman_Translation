PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. His abdomen was prepped and draped in a standard, sterile surgical fashion. A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression. Marcaine was injected into his umbilicus. A small incision was made. A Veress needle was introduced in his abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg and a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through his umbilicus. A 5-mm port was then placed just to the right side of the umbilicus. Another 5-mm port was placed just suprapubic in the midline. Upon inspection of the cecum, I was able find an inflamed and indurated appendix. I was able to clear the mesentery at the base of the appendix between the appendix and the cecum. I fired a white load stapler across the appendix at its base and fired a grey load stapler across the mesentery, and thereby divided the mesentery and freed the appendix. I put the appendix in an Endocatch bag and removed it through the umbilicus. I irrigated out the abdomen. I then closed the fascia of the umbilicus with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason and closed the skin of all incisions with a running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.",

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and laid on his back on the table. He was put under general anesthesia and a breathing tube was inserted. His belly was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A Foley catheter was inserted to empty the bladder. Marcaine (a local anesthetic) was injected around his belly button. A small cut was made. A Veress needle was inserted into his belly. CO₂ gas was pumped in to create a small space, keeping the pressure at a maximum of 15 mmHg. A 12‑mm VersaStep port was put through the belly button. A 5‑mm port was placed just to the right of the belly button. Another 5‑mm port was placed just above the pubic bone in the middle line. When the surgeon looked at the cecum, he found an inflamed and thickened appendix. He cleared the tissue at the base of the appendix between the appendix and the cecum. He used a white load stapler to close off the base of the appendix and a grey load stapler to close off the mesentery, cutting the mesentery and freeing the appendix. The appendix was placed in an Endocatch bag and taken out through the belly button. The belly was washed out. The surgeon closed the belly button muscle layer with interrupted 0 Vicryl stitches using a Carter‑Thomason device and closed the skin of all incisions with a running Monocryl stitch. The sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
