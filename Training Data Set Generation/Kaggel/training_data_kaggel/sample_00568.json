  "medical": "CC: Progressive lower extremity weakness. HX: This 54 y/o RHF presented on 7/3/93 with a 2 month history of lower extremity weakness. She was admitted to a local hospital on 5/3/93 for a 3 day h/o of progressive BLE weakness associated with incontinence and BLE numbness. There was little symptom of upper extremity weakness at that time, according to the patient. Her evaluation was notable for a bilateral L1 sensory level and 4/4 strength in BLE. A T-L-S Spine MRI revealed a T4-6 lipomatosis with anterior displacement of the cord without cord compression. CSF analysis yielded: opening pressure of 14cm H20, protein 88, glucose 78, 3 lymphocytes and 160 RBC, no oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index, and negative cytology. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. B12, Folate, and Ferritin levels were normal. CRP 5.2 (elevated). ANA was positive at 1:5,120 in speckled pattern. Her hospital course was complicated by deep venous thrombosis, which recurred after heparin was stopped to do the bone marrow biopsy. She was subsequently placed on Coumadin. EMG/NCV testing revealed &quot; lumbosacral polyradiculopathy with axonal degeneration and nerve conduction block.&quot; She was diagnosed with atypical Guillain-Barre vs. polyradiculopathy and received a single course of Decadron; and no plasmapheresis or IV IgG. She was discharged home o 6/8/93. She subsequently did not improve and after awaking from a nap on her couch the day of presentation, 7/3/93, she found she was paralyzed from the waist down. There was associated mild upper lumbar back pain without radiation. She had had no bowel movement or urination since that time. She had no recent trauma, fever, chills, changes in vision, dysphagia or upper extremity deficit. MEDS: Coumadin 7.5mg qd, Zoloft 50mg qd, Lithium 300mg bid. PMH: 1) Bi-polar Affective Disorder, dx 1979 2) C-section. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP118/64, HR103, RR18, Afebrile. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent without dysarthria. Lucid thought processes. CN: Unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength in BUE. Plegic in BLE. Flaccid muscle tone. SENSORY: L1 sensory level (bilaterally) to PP and TEMP, without sacral sparing. Proprioception was lost in both feet. CORD: Normal in BUE. Reflexes were 2+/2+ in BUE. They were not elicited in BLE. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally. RECTAL: Poor rectal tone. stool guaiac negative. She had no perirectal sensation. COURSE: CRP 8.8 and ESR 76. FVC 2.17L. WBC 1.5 (150 bands, 555 neutrophils, 440 lymphocytes and 330 monocytes), Hct 33%, Hgb 11.0, Plt 220K, MCV 88, GS normal except for slightly low total protein (8.0). LFT were normal. Creatinine 1.0. PT and PTT were normal. ABCG 7.46/25/79/96% O2Sat. UA notable for 1+ proteinuria. EKG normal. MRI L-spine, 7/3/93, revealed an area of abnormally increased T2 signal extending from T12 through L5. This area causes anterior displacement of the spinal cord and nerve roots. The cauda equina are pushed up against the posterior L1 vertebral body. There bilaterally pulmonary effusions. There is also abnormally increased T2 signal in the center of the spinal cord extending from the mid thoracic level through the conus. In addition, the Fila Terminale appear thickened. There is increased signal in the T3 vertebral body suggestion a hemangioma. The findings were felt consistent with a large epidural lipoma displacing the spinal cord anteriorly. there also appeared spinal cord swelling and increased signal within the spinal cord which suggests an intramedullary process. CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,342, glucose 43, RBC 4,900, WBC 9. C3 and C$ complement levels were 94 and 18 respectively (normal) Anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. Serum Beta-2 microglobulin was elevated at 2.4 and 3.7 in the CSF and Serum, respectively. It was felt the patient had either a transverse myelitis associated with SLE vs. partial cord infarction related to lupus vasculopathy or hypercoagulable state. She was place on IV Decadron. Rheumatology felt that a diagnosis of SLE was likely. Pulmonary effusion analysis was consistent with an exudate. She was treated with plasma exchange and place on Cytoxan. On 7/22/93 she developed fever with associated proptosis and sudden loss of vision, OD. MRI Brain, 7/22/93, revealed a 5mm thick area of intermediate signal adjacent to the posterior aspect of the right globe, possibly representing hematoma. Ophthalmology felt she had a central retinal vein occlusion; and it was surgically decompressed. She was placed on prednisone on 8/11/93 and Cytoxan was started on 8/16/93. She developed a headache with meningismus on 8/20/93. CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,002, glucose2, WBC 8,925 (majority were neutrophils). Sinus CT scan negative. She was placed on IV Antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis. Cultures were subsequently negative. She spontaneously recovered. 8/25/93, cisternal tap CSF analysis revealed: protein 126, glucose 35, WBC 144 (neutrophils), RBC 95, Cultures negative, cytology negative. MRI Brain scan revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement in both brain and spinal canal. DSDNA negative. She developed leukopenia in 9/93, and she was switched from Cytoxan to Imuran. Her LFT's rose and the Imuran was stopped and she was placed back on prednisone. She went on to have numerous deep venous thrombosis while on Coumadin. This required numerous hospital admissions for heparinization. Anticardiolipin antibodies and Protein C and S testing was negative.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:**  \nThe patient, a 54‑year‑old woman, has been getting weaker in her legs over time.\n\n**Past History (July 3, 1993):**  \n- She first noticed weakness in both legs about two months earlier.  \n- On May 3, 1993 she was admitted to a local hospital for three days of worsening weakness in both legs, trouble controlling urine, and numbness in both legs. She did not feel any weakness in her arms at that time.  \n- Examination then showed a sensory loss at the level of the first lumbar vertebra (L1) and normal strength (4/4) in both legs.  \n- An MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine (T‑L‑S) showed a fatty growth (lipoma) from T4‑T6 that pushed the spinal cord forward but did not compress it.  \n- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test: opening pressure 14 cm H₂O, protein 88 mg/dL, glucose 78 mg/dL, 3 lymphocytes, 160 red blood cells (RBCs), no abnormal protein bands, negative cancer cells.  \n- Bone‑marrow biopsy was normal.  \n- Vitamin B12, folate, and ferritin were normal.  \n- C‑reactive protein (CRP) was high at 5.2 mg/dL.  \n- Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was strongly positive (1:5,120, speckled pattern).  \n- She developed a deep‑vein thrombosis (DVT) while in the hospital; it recurred after stopping heparin for the bone‑marrow biopsy. She was then started on Coumadin (warfarin).  \n- Nerve studies (EMG/NCV) showed damage to the nerves in the lower back and legs with loss of nerve function.  \n- She was diagnosed with an unusual form of Guillain‑Barré syndrome or a similar nerve disease and received one course of steroids (Decadron). No plasma exchange or IVIG was given.  \n- She was discharged home on June 8, 1993.  \n- She did not get better. On July 3, 1993, after waking from a nap, she found she was paralyzed from the waist down. She had mild lower back pain, no bowel movement or urination since then, and no recent injury, fever, chills, vision changes, trouble swallowing, or arm weakness.\n\n**Medications at that time:**  \n- Coumadin 7.5 mg daily  \n- Zoloft 50 mg daily  \n- Lithium 300 mg twice daily  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1. Bipolar affective disorder (diagnosed 1979)  \n2. Cesarean section  \n\n**Family History:** Unremarkable.  \n**Social History:** No tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.\n\n**Physical Examination (July 3, 1993):**  \n- Blood pressure 118/64 mm Hg, heart rate 103 bpm, breathing 18/min, no fever.  \n- Alert and oriented. Speech normal.  \n- Cranial nerves normal.  \n- Upper‑arm strength 5/5.  \n- Lower‑leg strength absent (paralysis).  \n- Leg muscles were flaccid (no tone).  \n- Sensation: loss of pain and temperature at L1 level on both sides; no sensation in the feet.  \n- Reflexes 2+/2+ in arms, none in legs.  \n- Plantar reflexes (foot) unclear.  \n- Rectal tone weak, no perirectal sensation.  \n- Stool guaiac test negative.\n\n**Course and Additional Tests:**  \n- CRP rose to 8.8, ESR 76.  \n- Forced vital capacity (lung function) 2.17 L.  \n- White‑blood‑cell count low at 1.5 k/µL (with 150 bands, 555 neutrophils, 440 lymphocytes, 330 monocytes).  \n- Hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL, hematocrit 33%, platelets 220 k/µL, MCV 88 fL.  \n- Total protein slightly low at 8.0 g/dL.  \n- Liver enzymes normal.  \n- Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL.  \n- PT and PTT normal.  \n- Oxygen saturation 96 %.  \n- Urinalysis: 1+ protein.  \n- EKG normal.  \n\n**MRI of the lumbar spine (July 3, 1993):**  \n- A bright area on T2‑weighted images from T12 to L5, pushing the spinal cord and nerve roots forward.  \n- The cauda equina (bundle of nerves) was pushed up against the back of the L1 vertebra.  \n- Both lungs had fluid (effusions).  \n- Bright signal in the middle of the spinal cord from the middle thoracic level to the conus (bottom of the cord).  \n- The filum terminale (thin filament at the end of the cord) looked thickened.  \n- The T3 vertebral body had a bright spot suggesting a hemangioma (blood vessel tumor).  \n- Findings were thought to be a large fatty growth (epidural lipoma) pushing the cord forward, with possible swelling and signal changes inside the cord (intramedullary process).  \n\n**CSF (July 3, 1993):**  \n- Protein 1,342 mg/dL, glucose 43 mg/dL, 4,900 RBCs, 9 WBCs.  \n- Complement C3 94, C4 18 (normal).  \n- Anticardiolipin antibodies negative.  \n- Beta‑2 microglobulin high in CSF (2.4) and serum (3.7).  \n\n**Interpretation:**  \nThe doctors thought she had either transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or a partial spinal cord stroke due to lupus‑related blood vessel disease or a clotting problem. She was given IV steroids (Decadron). Rheumatology suspected SLE. The lung fluid was an exudate (fluid from inflammation). She received plasma exchange and was started on Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide).\n\n**July 22, 1993:**  \n- She developed fever, bulging eye (proptosis), and sudden loss of vision in the right eye.  \n- Brain MRI showed a 5 mm thick area near the back of the right eye, possibly a hematoma.  \n- Ophthalmology diagnosed a central retinal vein occlusion and performed surgery to relieve pressure.  \n- She was started on prednisone (8/11/93) and Cytoxan (8/16/93).  \n\n**August 20, 1993:**  \n- She had a severe headache with neck stiffness (meningismus).  \n- CSF: protein 1,002 mg/dL, glucose 2 mg/dL, 8,925 WBCs (mostly neutrophils).  \n- Sinus CT scan normal.  \n- She was treated with IV antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis; cultures later came back negative. She recovered on her own.  \n\n**August 25, 1993:**  \n- CSF from a cisternal tap: protein 126 mg/dL, glucose 35 mg/dL, 144 WBCs (neutrophils), 95 RBCs, cultures and cytology negative.  \n- Brain MRI showed diffuse enhancement of the meninges (leptomeningeal enhancement) in the brain and spinal canal.  \n- DNA for lupus (dsDNA) negative.  \n\n**September 1993:**  \n- She developed low white‑blood‑cell count. Cytoxan was switched to Imuran (azathioprine).  \n- Liver enzymes rose, so Imuran was stopped and she was put back on prednisone.  \n\n**Throughout this period:**  \n- She had many deep‑vein thromboses while on Coumadin, requiring repeated hospital stays and heparin treatment.  \n- Tests for anticardiolipin antibodies, Protein C, and Protein S were negative."
