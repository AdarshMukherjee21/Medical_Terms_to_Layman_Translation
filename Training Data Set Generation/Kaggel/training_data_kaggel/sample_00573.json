  "medical": "INDICATIONS: Atrial fibrillation, coronary disease. STRESS TECHNIQUE: The patient was infused with dobutamine to a maximum heart rate of 142. ECG exhibits atrial fibrillation. IMAGE TECHNIQUE: The patient was injected with 5.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system. IMAGE ANALYSIS: It should be noted that the images are limited slightly by the patient's obesity with a weight of 263 pounds. There is normal LV myocardial perfusion. The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 65%. There is normal global and regional wall motion. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Basic rhythm of atrial fibrillation with no change during dobutamine stress, maximum heart rate of 142. 2. Normal LV myocardial perfusion. 3. Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 65%. 4. Normal global and regional wall motion.",
  "layman": "**Indications:**  \nThe patient has atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease.\n\n**Stress test:**  \nThe patient received dobutamine until the heart rate reached 142 beats per minute. The ECG still showed atrial fibrillation.\n\n**Imaging:**  \nThe patient was given 5.2 millicuries of thallium chloride and then scanned with a gated SPECT tomograph. Because the patient weighs 263 pounds, the images are a little limited.\n\n**Findings:**  \n- The left ventricle (LV) receives normal blood flow.  \n- The LV pumping strength (ejection fraction) is normal at 65%.  \n- The heart’s wall motion is normal both overall and in specific regions.\n\n**Conclusions:**  \n1. Atrial fibrillation was present and did not change during the stress test, with a maximum heart rate of 142.  \n2. Blood flow to the LV is normal.  \n3. LV pumping strength is normal at 65%.  \n4. Wall motion of the heart is normal."
