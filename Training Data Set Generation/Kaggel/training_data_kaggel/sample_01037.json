  "medical": "PROCEDURE DONE: Resting Myoview and adenosine Myoview SPECT. INDICATIONS: Chest pain. PROCEDURE: 13.3 mCi of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was injected and resting Myoview SPECT was obtained. Pharmacologic stress testing was done using adenosine infusion. Patient received 38 mg of adenosine infused at 140 mcg/kg/minute over a period of four minutes. Two minutes during adenosine infusion, 31.6 mCi of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was injected. Resting heart rate was 90 beats per minute. Resting blood pressure was 130/70. Peak heart rate obtained during adenosine infusion was 102 beats per minute. Blood pressure obtained during adenosine infusion was 112/70. During adenosine infusion, patient experienced dizziness and shortness of breath. No significant ST segment, T wave changes, or arrhythmias were seen. Resting Myoview and adenosine Myoview SPECT showed uniform uptake of isotope throughout myocardium without any perfusion defect. Gated dynamic imaging showed normal wall motion and normal systolic thickening throughout left ventricular myocardium. Left ventricular ejection fraction obtained during adenosine Myoview SPECT was 77%. Lung heart ratio was 0.40. TID ratio was 0.88. IMPRESSION: Normal adenosine Myoview myocardial perfusion SPECT. Normal left ventricular regional and global function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 77%.",
  "layman": "**Procedure performed:** Resting and adenosine stress heart scan (Myoview SPECT).\n\n**Reason for the test:** Chest pain.\n\n**What was done:**  \n- 13.3 mCi of a radioactive tracer (Tc‑99m tetrofosmin) was injected and a resting scan was taken.  \n- The patient was given a drug called adenosine to make the heart work harder. Adenosine was infused at 140 µg/kg/min for four minutes, totaling 38 mg.  \n- Two minutes into the infusion, another 31.6 mCi of the tracer was injected.  \n- The patient’s resting heart rate was 90 beats per minute and blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg.  \n- While receiving adenosine, the heart rate rose to 102 beats per minute and blood pressure fell to 112/70 mm Hg.  \n- The patient felt dizzy and short of breath during the infusion.  \n- No abnormal heart rhythm or changes on the ECG were seen.\n\n**Results:**  \n- The tracer spread evenly through the heart muscle, showing no areas with poor blood flow.  \n- The heart’s walls moved normally and thickened properly during contraction.  \n- The left ventricle pumped out 77 % of the blood it holds (normal ejection fraction).  \n- The lung‑to‑heart ratio was 0.40 and the TID ratio was 0.88.\n\n**Conclusion:** The stress scan shows normal blood flow to the heart and normal heart function, with a healthy ejection fraction of 77 %."
