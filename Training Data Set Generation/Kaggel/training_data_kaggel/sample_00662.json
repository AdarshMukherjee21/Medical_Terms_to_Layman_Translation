  "medical": "CC: BLE weakness and numbness. HX: This 59 y/o RHM was seen and released from an ER 1 week prior to this presentation for a 3 week history of progressive sensory and motor deficits in both lower extremities. He reported numbness beginning about his trunk and slowly progressing to involve his lower extremities over a 4 week period. On presentation, he felt numb from the nipple line down. In addition, he began experiencing progressive weakness in his lower extremities for the past week. He started using a cane 5 days before being seen and had been having difficulty walking and traversing stairs. He claimed he could not stand. He denied loss of bowel or bladder control. However, he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days and he had not urinated 24 hours. His lower extremities had been feeling cold for a day. He denied any associated back or neck pain. He has chronic shortness of breath, but felt it had become worse. He had also been experiencing lightheadedness upon standing more readily than usual for 2 days prior to presentation. PMH: 1)CAD with chronic CP, 2)NQWMI 1994, S/P Coronary Angioplasty, 3)COPD (previous FEV 11.48, and FVC 2.13), 4)Anxiety D/O, 5)DJD, 6)Developed confusion with metoprolol use, 7)HTN. MEDS: Benadryl, ECASA, Diltiazem, Isordil, Enalapril, Indomethacin, Terbutaline MDI, Ipratropium MDI, Folic Acid, Thiamine. SHX: 120pk-yr smoking, ETOH abuse in past, Retired Dock Hand FHX: unremarkable except for ETOH abuse EXAM: T98.2 96bpm 140/74mmHg R18 Thin cachetic male in moderate distress. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was fluent and without dysarthria. Comprehension, naming and reading were intact. CN: unremarkable. Motor: Full strength in both upper extremities. HF HE HAdd HAbd KF KE AF AE RLE 3 3 4 4 3 4 1 1 LLE 4 4 4+ 4+ 4+ 4 4 4 There was mild spastic muscle tone in the lower extremities. There was normal muscle bulk throughout. SENSORY: Decreased PP in the LLE from the foot to nipple line, and in the RLE from the knee to nipple line. Decreased Temperature sensation from the feet to the umbilicus, bilaterally. No loss of Vibration or Proprioception. Decreased light touch from the feet to nipple line, bilaterally. Gait: unable to walk. Stands with support only. Station: no pronator drift or truncal ataxia. Reflexes: 2+/2+ in BUE, 3+/3+ patellae, 0/1 ankles. Babinski signs were present, bilaterally. The abdominal reflexes were absent. CV: RRR with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. Lungs: CTA with mildly labored breathing. Abdomen: NT, ND, NBS, but bladder distended. Extremities were cool to touch. Peripheral pulses were intact and capillary refill was brisk. Rectal: decreased rectal tone and absent anal reflex. Right prostate nodule at the inferior pole. COURSE: Admission Labs: FEV1=1.17, FVC 2.19, ABG 7.39/42/79 on room air. WBC 10/5, Hgb 13, Hct 39, Electrolytes were normal. PT & PTT were normal. Straight catheterization revealed a residual volume of 400cc of urine. He underwent emergent T-spine MRI. This revealed a T3-4 vertebral body lesion which had invaded the spinal canal was compressing the spinal cord. He was treated with Decadron and underwent emergent spinal cord decompression on 5/7/95. He recovered some lower extremity strength following surgery. Pathological analysis of the tumor was consistent with adenocarcinoma. His primary tumor was not located despite chest-abdominal-pelvic CT scans, and a GI and GU workup which included cystoscopy and endoscopy. He received 3000cGy of XRT and died 5 months after presentation.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nA 59‑year‑old right‑handed man came to the hospital with weakness and numbness in both legs.\n\n**History of Present Illness**  \nHe had been in the emergency room a week earlier for a 3‑week history of numbness that started around his trunk and slowly spread down to his legs. By the time he was seen again, the numbness extended from the nipple line to his feet. In the past week he also felt his legs getting weaker. He began using a cane five days before the visit and had trouble walking or going up stairs. He said he could not stand on his own. He did not lose control of his bowels or bladder, but he had not had a bowel movement in three days and had not urinated in 24 hours. His legs felt cold for a day. He had no back or neck pain. He has chronic shortness of breath that seemed worse, and he felt light‑headed when standing for the last two days.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \n- Coronary artery disease with chronic chest pain  \n- Non‑Q‑wave myocardial infarction in 1994, treated with coronary angioplasty  \n- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (previous FEV1 11.48, FVC 2.13)  \n- Anxiety disorder  \n- Degenerative joint disease  \n- Confusion while taking metoprolol  \n- Hypertension  \n\n**Medications**  \nBenadryl, ECASA, diltiazem, Isordil, enalapril, indomethacin, terbutaline inhaler, ipratropium inhaler, folic acid, thiamine.\n\n**Social History**  \n- 120 pack‑year smoking history  \n- Past alcohol abuse  \n- Retired dock worker  \n\n**Family History**  \nUnremarkable except for alcohol abuse in the family.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- Temperature 98.2 °F, pulse 96 bpm, blood pressure 140/74 mmHg  \n- Thin, cachectic male in moderate distress  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time  \n- Speech fluent, no slurring; comprehension, naming, and reading normal  \n- Cranial nerves normal  \n- Upper‑extremity strength normal  \n- Lower‑extremity strength: mild weakness, spastic tone, normal muscle bulk  \n- Sensation: decreased pain and temperature from feet to nipple line; light touch also decreased; vibration and proprioception normal  \n- Gait: cannot walk, needs support to stand  \n- Reflexes: normal in arms, increased knee reflexes, decreased ankle reflexes; Babinski sign present on both sides  \n- Abdominal reflexes absent  \n- Heart: regular rhythm, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at left sternal border  \n- Lungs: clear to auscultation, mild labored breathing  \n- Abdomen: non‑tender, no distension, bladder distended  \n- Extremities cool to touch; peripheral pulses present, capillary refill brisk  \n- Rectal exam: decreased tone, absent anal reflex; right prostate nodule noted\n\n**Laboratory Results**  \n- FEV1 1.17, FVC 2.19  \n- Arterial blood gas: pH 7.39, PaCO₂ 42, PaO₂ 79 on room air  \n- White blood cell count 10.5 k/µL, hemoglobin 13 g/dL, hematocrit 39 %  \n- Electrolytes, PT, and PTT normal  \n- Catheterization showed 400 mL residual urine\n\n**Imaging**  \nAn emergent MRI of the thoracic spine revealed a lesion at T3‑T4 that had invaded the spinal canal and was compressing the spinal cord.\n\n**Treatment and Course**  \nHe received steroids (Decadron) and underwent emergency spinal cord decompression surgery on May 7, 1995. After surgery he regained some strength in his legs. Pathology of the removed tissue showed adenocarcinoma. Extensive scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as gastrointestinal and genitourinary evaluations (including cystoscopy and endoscopy), did not locate the primary tumor. He received 3,000 cGy of radiation therapy. Unfortunately, he died five months after the initial presentation."
