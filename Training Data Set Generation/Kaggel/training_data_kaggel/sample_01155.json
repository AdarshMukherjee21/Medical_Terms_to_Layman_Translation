  "medical": "CC: Episodic confusion. HX: This 65 y/o RHM reportedly suffered a stroke on 1/17/92. He presented locally at that time with complaint of episodic confusion and memory loss lasting several minutes per episode. The &quot;stroke&quot; was reportedly verified on MRI scan dated 1/17/92. He was subsequently placed on ASA and DPH. He admitted that there had been short periods (1-2 days duration) since then, during which he had forgotten to take his DPH. However, even when he had been taking his DPH regularly, he continued to experience the spells mentioned above. He denied any associated tonic/clonic movement, incontinence, tongue-biting, HA, visual change, SOB, palpitation, weakness or numbness. The episodes of confusion and memory loss last 1-2 minutes in duration, and have been occurring 2-3 times per week. PMH: Bilateral Hearing Loss of unknown etiology, S/P bilateral ear surgery many years ago. MEDS: DPH and ASA SHX/FHX: 2-4 Beers/day. 1-2 packs of cigarettes per day. EXAM: BP 111/68, P 68BPM, 36.8C. Alert and Oriented to person, place and time, 30/30 on mini-mental status test, Speech fluent and without dysarthria. CN: Left superior quandranopia only. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout. Sensory: unremarkable except for mild decreased vibration sense in feet. Coordination: unremarkable. Gait and station testing were unremarkable. He was able to tandem walk without difficulty. Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric throughout. Flexor plantar responses bilaterally. LAB: Gen Screen, CBC, PT, PTT all WNL. DPH 4.6mcg/ml. Review of outside MRI Brain done 1/17/92 revealed decreased T1 and increased T2 signal in the Right temporal lobe involving the uncus and adjacent hippocampus. The area did not enhance with gadolinium contrast. CXR: 8/31/92: 5 x 6 mm spiculated opacity in apex right lung. EEG: 8/24/92: normal awake and asleep MRI Brain with/without contrast: 8/31/92: Decreased T1 and increased T2 signal in the right temporal lobe. The lesion increased in size and enhances more greatly when compared to the 1/17/92 MRI exam. There is also edema surrounding the affected area and associated mass effect. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING: Low-average digit symbol substitution, mildly impaired verbal learning, and severely defective delayed recall. There was relative preservation of other cognitive functions. The findings were consistent with left mesiotemporal dysfunction. COURSE: Patient underwent right temporal lobectomy on 9/16/92 following initial treatment with Decadron. Pathologic analysis was consistent with a Grade 2 astrocytoma. GFAP staining positive. Following surgery he underwent 5040 cGy radiation therapy in 28 fractions to the tumor bed.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:**  \nEpisodes of confusion that come and go.\n\n**History:**  \nA 65‑year‑old man had a stroke on January 17, 1992. At that time he had brief episodes of confusion and memory loss that lasted a few minutes each. An MRI on that date confirmed the stroke. He was started on aspirin (ASA) and dipyridamole (DPH). He sometimes missed DPH for 1–2 days, but even when he took it regularly the episodes still happened. He reports no seizures, incontinence, tongue‑biting, headaches, vision changes, shortness of breath, palpitations, weakness, or numbness. The confusion episodes last 1–2 minutes and occur 2–3 times a week.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hearing loss in both ears of unknown cause; had ear surgery on both sides many years ago.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Dipyridamole  \n- Aspirin\n\n**Social/Family History:**  \n- Drinks 2–4 beers per day  \n- Smokes 1–2 packs of cigarettes daily\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- Blood pressure 111/68 mm Hg, pulse 68 bpm, temperature 36.8 °C  \n- Alert, oriented to person, place, and time; scored 30/30 on a brief mental test  \n- Speech fluent, no slurring  \n- Small visual field loss in the upper left side (left superior quadrantanopia)  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 in all limbs  \n- Sensation normal except mild loss of vibration sense in feet  \n- Coordination, balance, and walking normal; could walk heel‑to‑toe without difficulty  \n- Reflexes 2+ and symmetrical; feet respond normally to reflex testing\n\n**Laboratory Tests:**  \n- General screen, complete blood count, PT, PTT all within normal limits  \n- Blood level of dipyridamole 4.6 µg/ml\n\n**Imaging and Other Tests:**  \n- MRI brain (Jan 17, 1992): change in the right temporal lobe near the uncus and hippocampus; no contrast enhancement  \n- Chest X‑ray (Aug 31, 1992): 5 × 6 mm spiky spot in the upper right lung  \n- EEG (Aug 24, 1992): normal while awake and asleep  \n- Repeat MRI brain (Aug 31, 1992): same area in the right temporal lobe larger, brighter with contrast, with swelling around it that pushes on nearby brain tissue\n\n**Neuropsychological Testing:**  \n- Average speed on a symbol‑substitution task  \n- Mild difficulty learning new words  \n- Very poor delayed memory recall  \n- Other cognitive functions mostly normal  \n- Findings suggest problems in the left middle‑temporal area of the brain\n\n**Course and Treatment:**  \n- Underwent surgery to remove part of the right temporal lobe on Sept 16, 1992 after starting steroids (Decadron).  \n- Pathology showed a grade 2 astrocytoma (a type of brain tumor), confirmed by GFAP staining.  \n- After surgery received radiation therapy of 5040 cGy delivered in 28 sessions to the area where the tumor was."
