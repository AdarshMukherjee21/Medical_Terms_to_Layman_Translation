  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is to come to the hospital for bilateral L5 kyphoplasty. The patient is an 86-year-old female with an L5 compression fracture. The patient has a history of back and buttock pain for some time. She was found to have an L5 compression fracture. She was treated conservatively over several months, but did not improve. Unfortunately, she has continued to have significant ongoing back pain and recent CT scan has shown a sclerosis with some healing of her L5 compression fracture, but without complete healing. The patient has had continued pain and at this time, is felt to be a candidate for kyphoplasty. She denies bowel or bladder incontinence. She does complain of back pain. She has been wearing a back brace and corset. She does not have weakness. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of multiple medical problems including hypothyroidism, hypertension, and gallbladder difficulties. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has had multiple previous surgeries including bowel surgery, hysterectomy, rectocele repair, and appendectomy. She also has a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: She is on multiple medications currently. ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO CODEINE, PENICILLIN, AND CEPHALOSPORINS. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's parents are deceased. PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives locally. She is a widow. She does not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is an elderly frail white female in no distress. LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Sounds are regular. ABDOMEN: She has a protuberant abdomen. She has tenderness to palpation in the lumbosacral area. Sciatic notch tenderness is not present. Straight leg raise testing evokes back pain. NEUROLOGICAL: She is awake, alert, and oriented. Speech is intact. Comprehension is normal. Strength is intact in the upper extremities. She has giveaway strength in the lower extremities. Reflexes are diminished at the knees and ankles. Gait is otherwise normal. DATA REVIEWED: Plain studies of the lumbar spine show an L5 compression fracture. A CT scan has shown some healing of this fracture. She has degenerative change at the L4-L5 level with a very slight spondylolisthesis at this level. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a woman with a history of longstanding back, buttock, and leg pain. She has a documented L5 compression fracture, which has not healed despite appropriate conservative treatments. At this point, I believe the patient is a good candidate for L5 kyphoplasty. I have discussed the procedure with her and I have reviewed with her and her family risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery. Risks of surgery including but not limited to bleeding, infection, stroke, paralysis, death, failure to improve, spinal fluid leak, need for further surgery, cement extravasation, failure to improve her pain, and other potential complications have all been discussed. The patient understands the issues involved. She requested that we proceed with surgery as noted above and will come to the hospital for this surgery on 01/18/08.",
  "layman": "**History**  \nThe patient will go to the hospital for a kyphoplasty on both sides of her L5 vertebra. She is an 86‑year‑old woman who has a compression fracture at L5. She has had back and buttock pain for a long time. The fracture was found and she was treated with rest, medication, and a back brace for several months, but her pain did not get better. A recent CT scan shows that the fracture has started to heal but is not fully healed. She still has significant back pain, so the doctor thinks she is a good candidate for kyphoplasty. She does not have bowel or bladder problems and does not feel weak.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \nShe has several health problems, including an underactive thyroid, high blood pressure, and gallbladder issues.\n\n**Past Surgical History**  \nShe has had many surgeries: bowel surgery, hysterectomy, rectocele repair, and an appendectomy. She also has polymyalgia rheumatica.\n\n**Current Medications**  \nShe is taking several medicines (not listed here).\n\n**Allergies**  \nShe is allergic to codeine, penicillin, and cephalosporins.\n\n**Family History**  \nBoth of her parents have passed away.\n\n**Personal and Social History**  \nShe lives in the local area, is a widow, does not smoke, and does not use illegal drugs.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- **General**: Elderly, frail, white woman, not in distress.  \n- **Lungs**: Clear.  \n- **Heart**: Regular rhythm.  \n- **Abdomen**: Swollen belly; tenderness in the lower back area. No pain in the sciatic notch. Straight‑leg‑raise test causes back pain.  \n- **Neurologic**: Awake, alert, oriented. Speech and understanding are normal. Upper‑body strength is fine. Lower‑body strength is slightly weak. Knee and ankle reflexes are reduced. Walking is otherwise normal.\n\n**Data Reviewed**  \nX‑rays of the lower back show the L5 compression fracture. The CT scan shows some healing. There is wear and tear at the L4‑L5 level and a very small slip of one vertebra over another (spondylolisthesis).\n\n**Assessment and Plan**  \nThe patient has long‑standing back, buttock, and leg pain. The L5 fracture has not healed with non‑surgical treatment. The doctor believes she is a good candidate for L5 kyphoplasty. She has been told about the risks (bleeding, infection, stroke, paralysis, death, no improvement, spinal fluid leak, need for more surgery, cement leaking, and other complications) and benefits. She understands the information and has asked to proceed with the surgery. She will go to the hospital for the procedure on 01/18/08."
