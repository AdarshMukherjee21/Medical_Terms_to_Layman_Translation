  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above. He has history of neurogenic bladder, and on intermittent self-catheterization 3 times a day. However, June 24, 2008, he was seen in the ER, and with fever, weakness, possible urosepsis. He had a blood culture, which was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as urine culture noted for same bacteria. He was treated on IV antibiotics, Dr. XYZ also saw the patient. Discharged home. Not taking any antibiotics. Today in the office, the patient denies any dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills. He is catheterizing 3 times a day, changing his catheter weekly. Does have history of renal transplant, which has been followed by Dr. X and is on chronic steroids. Renal ultrasound, June 23, 2008, was noted for mild hydronephrosis of renal transplant with fluid in the pericapsular space. Creatinine, July 7, 2008 was 2.0, BUN 36, and patient tells me this is being followed by Dr. X. No interval complaints today, no issues with catheterization or any gross hematuria. IMPRESSION: 1. Neurogenic bladder, in a patient catheterizing himself 3 times a day, changing his catheter 3 times a week, we again reviewed the technique of catheterization, and he has no issues with this. 2. Recurrent urinary tract infection, in a patient who has been hospitalized twice within the last few months, he is on steroids for renal transplant, which has most likely been overall reducing his immune system. He is asymptomatic today. No complaints today. PLAN: Following a detailed discussion with the patient, we elected to proceed with intermittent self-catheterization, changing catheter weekly, and technique has been discussed as above. Based on the recent culture, we will place him on Keflex nighttime prophylaxis, for the next three months or so. He will call if any concerns. Follow up as previously scheduled in September for re-assessment. All questions answered. The patient is seen and evaluated by myself.",
  "layman": "**History of Present Illness:**  \nThe patient was referred to us from Dr. ABC’s office. He has a neurogenic bladder and uses a self‑catheter three times a day. On June 24, 2008 he went to the ER with fever and weakness that may have been urosepsis. Blood and urine cultures grew Staphylococcus epidermidis. He received IV antibiotics and was seen by Dr. XYZ. He was sent home and is not taking any antibiotics now.  \n\nToday he reports no painful urination, blood in the urine, fever, or chills. He still catheterizes three times a day and changes his catheter once a week. He has a kidney transplant and is on long‑term steroids. A renal ultrasound on June 23, 2008 showed mild swelling of the transplanted kidney with fluid around it. His creatinine on July 7, 2008 was 2.0 and BUN was 36; Dr. X is monitoring these. He has no new complaints or problems with catheter use or blood in the urine.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Neurogenic bladder – the patient continues to catheterize himself three times a day and changes the catheter weekly. We reviewed his technique and he reports no problems.  \n2. Recurrent urinary tract infections – he has been hospitalized twice in recent months. His steroid use for the transplant likely weakens his immune system. He is symptom‑free today.\n\n**Plan:**  \nWe discussed options and decided to keep intermittent self‑catheterization, changing the catheter weekly, and to use the technique we reviewed. Because of the recent culture, we will give him Keflex at night for about three months. He should call if anything changes. He will return for a follow‑up in September as scheduled. All questions were answered. The patient was examined by me."
