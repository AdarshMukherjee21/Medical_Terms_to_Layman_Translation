  "medical": "PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Umbilical hernia repair. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. The patient was sedated, and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A standard curvilinear umbilical incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the hernia sac using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The sac was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the fascial defect was delineated. The fascia was cleared of any adherent tissue for a distance of 1.5 cm from the defect. The sac was then placed into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed primarily using simple interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The umbilicus was then re-formed using 4-0 Vicryl to tack the umbilical skin to the fascia. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The skin was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",

She was given medicine to relax and a local numbing shot of 1% lidocaine (no epinephrine). The area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The surgeon made a curved cut around the belly button and cut down to the hernia sac using scissors and a small electric cautery tool. The sac was freed from any stuck tissue and the opening in the abdominal wall was outlined. The surrounding muscle layer was cleared of tissue for about 1.5 cm from the hole. The sac was pushed back into the belly and the hole was closed with simple stitches of 0 Vicryl. The belly button was reshaped by tying the skin to the muscle with 4‑0 Vicryl stitches. The wound was washed with sterile salt water and any bleeding was stopped with the cautery. The skin was stitched together with 4‑0 Vicryl in a layer just under the surface. The skin was treated with benzoin and Steri‑Strips were put on, followed by a dressing. All instruments and sponges were counted and the numbers matched. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was moved to the recovery room in good, stable condition."
