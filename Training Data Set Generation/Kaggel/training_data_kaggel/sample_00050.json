  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right trigger thumb. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right trigger thumb. SURGERY: Release of A1 pulley, CPT code 26055. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. TOURNIQUET TIME: 9 minutes at 200 torr. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have limitations to extension at the IP joint to the right thumb. He was found to have full extension after release of A1 pulley. INDICATIONS: The patient is 2-1/2-year-old. He has a history of a trigger thumb. This was evaluated in the office. He was indicated for release of A1 pulley to allow for full excursion. Risks and benefits including recurrence, infection, and problems with anesthesia were discussed at length with the family. They wanted to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position. General anesthesia was induced without incident. He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard fashion. Limb was exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. Tourniquet was raised to 200 torr. Transverse incision was then made at the base of thumb. The underlying soft tissues were carefully spread in line longitudinally. The underlying tendon was then identified. The accompanied A1 pulley was also identified. This was incised longitudinally using #11 blade. Inspection of the entire tendon then demonstrated good motion both in flexion and extension. The leaflets of the pulley were easily identified. The wound was then irrigated and closed. The skin was closed using interrupted #4-0 Monocryl simple sutures. The area was injected with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The wound was dressed with Xeroform, dry sterile dressings, hand dressing, Kerlix, and Coban. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications. All instrument, sponge, needle counts were correct at the end of case. PLAN: The patient will be discharged home. He will return in 1-1/2 weeks for wound inspection.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Right thumb that catches (trigger thumb).  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same.  \n**Surgery:** Cutting the A1 pulley in the thumb (CPT 26055).  \n**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA).  \n**Tourniquet:** 9 minutes at 200 mm Hg.  \n\n**Findings:** The right thumb could not fully straighten at the joint. After cutting the A1 pulley, the thumb could straighten completely.  \n\n**Indications:** The child is 2½ years old and has a trigger thumb. The doctor checked him in the office and decided that cutting the A1 pulley would let the thumb move normally. The family was told about the risks (recurrence, infection, anesthesia problems) and benefits, and they agreed to go ahead.  \n\n**Procedure:**  \n1. The child was taken to the operating room and laid on his back.  \n2. General anesthesia was started safely.  \n3. Antibiotics were given based on his weight.  \n4. The right arm was cleaned and covered.  \n5. A tourniquet was applied and set to 200 mm Hg.  \n6. A small horizontal cut was made at the base of the thumb.  \n7. The tissues were gently spread along the length of the arm.  \n8. The tendon and the A1 pulley were found.  \n9. The pulley was cut lengthwise with a #11 blade.  \n10. The tendon was checked and moved well in both bending and straightening.  \n11. The wound was washed and closed.  \n12. The skin was stitched with #4‑0 Monocryl sutures.  \n13. 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine (local anesthetic) was injected.  \n14. The area was covered with Xeroform, sterile dressings, a hand wrap, Kerlix, and Coban.  \n15. The child woke up from anesthesia and went to recovery in good condition.  \n16. No complications occurred. All instruments, sponges, and needles were counted correctly.  \n\n**Plan:** The child will go home and come back in 1½ weeks for a wound check."
