SENSORY: Decreased PP in third digit of left hand only (palmar and dorsal sides). STATION/GAIT/COORD: Unremarkable. REFLEXES: 1+ throughout, plantar responses were downgoing bilaterally. GEN EXAM: Unremarkable. Tinel's manuever elicited pain and numbness on the left. Phalens sign present on the left. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Left Carpal Tunnel Syndrome EMG/NCV: Unremarkable. MRI C-spine, 12/1/92: Congenitally small spinal canal is present. Superimposed on this is mild spondylosis and disc bulge at C6-7, C5-6, C4-5, and C3-4. There is moderate central spinal stenosis at C3-4. Intervertebral foramina at these levels appear widely patent. COURSE: The MRI findings did not correlate with the clinical findings and history. The patient was placed on Elavil and was subsequently lost to follow-up.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Numbness in the left middle finger and pain in the left wrist.  \n\n**History:** A 44‑year‑old man with a history of left hand pain came in with one month of numbness and pain in his left middle finger and wrist. The numbness started in the finger and spread to the wrist within a day. A few days later, wrist pain developed. He works as a cook and often cuts fish for long periods, which makes the symptoms worse. He has no problems with bowel or bladder, no neck pain, and no weakness. He has never had a neck injury.  \n\n**Social/Family History:** He smokes 1–2 cigarettes a day, is married, and has been off work for two weeks because of his symptoms.  \n\n**Exam:**  \n- Vital signs normal.  \n- Alert and oriented.  \n- Speech is clear.  \n- All cranial nerves normal.  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 everywhere, including hand muscles; no muscle wasting or abnormal tone.  \n- Sensation: reduced pain perception only in the left middle finger (both palm and back).  \n- Gait, balance, and coordination normal.  \n- Reflexes 1+ everywhere; feet respond normally.  \n- General exam normal.  \n\n**Special tests:** Tinel’s sign (tapping over the wrist) caused pain and numbness on the left. Phalen’s test (bending the wrist) was positive on the left.  \n\n**Clinical impression:** Left carpal tunnel syndrome.  \n\n**Tests:**  \n- EMG/NCV (nerve studies) normal.  \n- MRI of the cervical spine (12/1/92) showed a congenitally small spinal canal, mild wear and tear (spondylosis) and disc bulges at C6‑7, C5‑6, C4‑5, and C3‑4. There is moderate narrowing of the central spinal canal at C3‑4, but the spaces where nerves exit the spine are wide.  \n\n**Course:** The MRI findings did not match the patient’s symptoms and history. He was started on Elavil (a medication) and was not seen again."
