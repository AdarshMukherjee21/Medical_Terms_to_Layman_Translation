  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right distal femoral, subperiosteal abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right distal femoral, subperiosteal abscess. OPERATION: Repeat irrigation and debridement of above. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUID: Per anesthesia. DRAINS: Hemovac times two. COMPLICATIONS: None apparent. SPECIMENS: To microbiology. INDICATIONS: She is a 10-year-old girl who has history of burns and has developed a subperiosteal abscess at her right distal femur. I am bringing her back to the operating room for another exploration of this area and washout. This will be the third procedure for this. At the last time, there was gross purulence that was encountered. Since that time, the patient has defervesced. Her white count is slowly coming down. Her C-reactive protein is slowly coming down. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After informed consent was obtained, operative site marked, and after preoperative antibiotics were given, the patient was brought back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table, where Anesthesia induced general anesthesia. The patient's right lower extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Surgical timeout occurred verifying the patient's identification, surgical site, surgical procedure, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's previous incision sites had the sutures removed. We bluntly dissected down through to the IT band. These deep stitches were then removed. We exposed the area of the subperiosteal abscess. The tissue looked much better than at the last surgery. We irrigated this area with three liters of saline containing bacitracin. Next, we made our small medial window to assist with washout of the joint itself. We put another three liters of saline containing bacitracin through the knee joint. Lastly, we did another three liters into the area of the distal femur with three liters of plain saline. We then placed two Hemovac drains, one in the metaphysis and one superficially. We closed the deep fascia with #1 PDS. Subcutaneous layers with 2-0 Monocryl and closed the skin with 2-0 nylon. We placed a sterile dressing. We then turned the case over to Dr. Petty for dressing change and skin graft. PLAN: Our plan will be to pull the drains in 48 hours. We will then continue to watch the patient's fever curve and follow her white count to see how she is responding to the operative and medical therapies.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** A subperiosteal abscess (pus under the bone) in the lower part of the right thigh bone.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same abscess.  \n\n**Operation:** Clean out and remove infected tissue from the area again.  \n**Anesthesia:** General (the patient was put to sleep).  \n**Blood loss:** Very little.  \n**Fluids:** Given during anesthesia.  \n**Drains:** Two Hemovac drains were placed.  \n**Complications:** None seen.  \n**Specimens:** Tissue sent to the lab for culture.  \n\n**Indications:**  \nThe patient is a 10‑year‑old girl who had burns and now has a subperiosteal abscess in the lower part of her right thigh bone. She is having a third surgery to clean the area again. The last time, a lot of pus was found. Since then, her fever has gone down, her white‑blood‑cell count and C‑reactive protein are slowly decreasing.\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter the parents gave consent, the surgical site was marked and the patient received antibiotics before surgery. She was placed on her back on the operating table and put under general anesthesia. The right leg was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A surgical timeout was done to confirm the patient, the site, the procedure, and the antibiotics. Old stitches from previous incisions were removed. The surgeon gently cut through the tissue to reach the iliotibial band and removed the deep stitches. The abscess area was exposed and looked better than before. The area was washed with 3 liters of saline that had bacitracin in it. A small opening was made on the inside of the knee to help wash out the joint. Another 3 liters of bacitracin‑saline was flushed through the knee joint. A final 3 liters of plain saline was used on the distal femur. Two Hemovac drains were placed—one inside the bone area and one on the surface. The deep muscle layer was closed with #1 PDS sutures, the skin‑deep layer with 2‑0 Monocryl, and the skin with 2‑0 nylon. A sterile dressing was applied. The case was handed over to Dr. Petty for a dressing change and skin graft.\n\n**Plan:**  \nThe drains will be removed after 48 hours. The medical team will keep an eye on her fever and white‑blood‑cell count to see how she is doing after the surgery and medical treatment."
