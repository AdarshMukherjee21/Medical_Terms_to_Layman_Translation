  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: Pregnant female with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. FINDINGS: The uterus measures 8.6 x 4.4 x 5.4 cm and contains a gestational sac with double decidual sac sign. A yolk sac is visualized. What appears to represent a crown-rump length measures 3.3 mm for an estimated sonographic age of 6 weeks 0 days and estimated date of delivery of 09/28/09. Please note however that no fetal heart tones are seen. However, fetal heart tones would be expected at this age. The right ovary measures 3.1 x 1.6 x 2.3 cm. The left ovary measures 3.3 x 1.9 x 3.5 cm. No free fluid is detected. IMPRESSION: Single intrauterine pregnancy at 6 weeks 0 days with an estimated date of delivery of 09/28/09. A live intrauterine pregnancy, however, could not be confirmed, as a sonographic fetal heart rate would be expected at this time. A close interval followup in correlation with beta-hCG is necessary as findings may represent an inevitable abortion.",

A yolk sac is seen. A measurement that looks like crown‑rump length is 3.3 mm, which corresponds to about 6 weeks 0 days of pregnancy and an estimated delivery date of 09/28/09. No fetal heartbeats were seen, even though a heartbeat would normally be expected at this age. The right ovary is 3.1 x 1.6 x 2.3 cm. The left ovary is 3.3 x 1.9 x 3.5 cm. No free fluid is present. IMPRESSION: There is a single pregnancy inside the uterus at 6 weeks 0 days, with an expected delivery date of 09/28/09. A live pregnancy could not be confirmed because a fetal heartbeat was not seen, which should be present at this stage. A follow‑up scan and blood test for beta‑hCG are needed soon, as the results could indicate a miscarriage."
