  "medical": "EXAM: CT-guided needle placement, CT-guided biopsy of right renal mass, and embolization of biopsy tract with gelfoam. REASON FOR EXAM: This 60-year-old female who was found to have a solid indeterminate mass involving the inferior pole of the right kidney was referred for percutaneous biopsy under CT guidance at the request of Dr. X. PROCEDURE: The procedure risks and possible complications including, but not limited to severe hemorrhage which could result in emergent surgery, were explained to the patient. The patient understood. All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained. With the patient in the prone position, noncontrasted CT localization images were obtained through the kidney. Conscious sedation was utilized with the patient being monitored. The patient was administered divided dose of Versed and fentanyl intravenously. Following sterile preparation and local anesthesia to the posterior aspect of the right flank, an 18-gauge co-axial Temno-type needle was directed into the inferior pole right renal mass from the posterior oblique approach. Two biopsy specimens were obtained and placed in 10% formalin solution. CT documented needle placement. Following the biopsy, there was active bleeding through the stylet, as well as a small hematoma about the inferior aspect of the right kidney posteriorly. I placed several torpedo pledgets of Gelfoam through the co-axial sheath into the site of bleeding. The bleeding stopped. The co-axial sheath was then removed. Bandage was applied. Hemostasis was obtained. The patient was placed in the supine position. Postbiopsy CT images were then obtained. The patient's hematoma appeared stable. The patient was without complaints of pain or discomfort. The patient was then sent to her room with plans of observing for approximately 4 hours and then to be discharged, as stable. The patient was instructed to remain at bedrest for the remaining portions of the day at home and patient is to followup with Dr. Fieldstone for the results and follow-up care. FINDINGS: Initial noncontrasted CT localization images reveals the presence of an approximately 2.1 cm cortical mass involving the posterior aspect of the inferior pole of the right kidney. Images obtained during the biopsy reveals the cutting portion of the biopsy needle to extend through the mass. Images obtained following the biopsy reveals the development of a small hematoma posterior to the right kidney in its inferior pole adjacent to the mass. There are small droplets of air within the hematoma. No hydronephrosis is identified. CONCLUSION: 1. Percutaneous biopsy of inferior pole right renal mass under computed tomography guidance with specimen sent to laboratory in 10% formalin solution. 2. Development of a small hematoma adjacent to the inferior pole of the right kidney with active bleeding through the biopsy needle stopped by tract embolization with Gelfoam pledgets.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** A CT‑guided needle was used to biopsy a mass in the lower part of the right kidney, and the needle track was sealed with gelfoam.\n\n**Reason for Exam:** A 60‑year‑old woman was found to have a solid, unclear mass on the lower part of her right kidney. She was referred for a CT‑guided biopsy at the request of Dr. X.\n\n**Procedure:**  \nThe doctor explained the risks, including serious bleeding that might need emergency surgery. The patient understood, asked questions, and gave written consent.  \nShe lay on her stomach while the doctor took non‑contrast CT images to locate the kidney.  \nThe patient was given conscious sedation with Versed and fentanyl, and her vital signs were monitored.  \nAfter cleaning the area and numbing the back of her right flank, an 18‑gauge needle was guided into the mass from the back. Two tissue samples were taken and placed in formalin.  \nCT confirmed the needle was in the right spot.  \nAfter the biopsy, the needle was bleeding and a small bruise (hematoma) formed behind the kidney. The doctor inserted gelfoam pledgets through the needle to stop the bleeding. The bleeding stopped, the needle was removed, and a bandage was applied.  \nThe patient was turned to lie on her back, and a follow‑up CT scan showed the bruise was stable. She had no pain or discomfort.  \nShe was sent back to her room to rest for about 4 hours, then discharged as stable. She was told to stay in bed for the rest of the day at home and to follow up with Dr. Fieldstone for results and further care.\n\n**Findings:**  \nThe initial CT showed a 2.1‑cm mass on the back side of the lower part of the right kidney. During the biopsy, the needle cut through the mass. After the biopsy, a small bruise formed behind the kidney near the mass, with a few air bubbles inside. The kidney was not swollen.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n1. A CT‑guided biopsy of the lower right kidney mass was performed and the samples were sent for lab analysis.  \n2. A small bruise formed next to the lower right kidney, and bleeding was stopped by placing gelfoam in the needle track."
