  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left little finger extensor tendon laceration. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left little finger extensor tendon laceration. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left little extensor tendon. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: Bier block. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 14-year-old right-hand dominant male who cut the back of his left little finger and had a small cut to his extensor tendon. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room, laid supine, administered intervenous sedation with Bier block and prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The old laceration was opened and the extensor tendon was identified and there was a small longitudinal laceration in the tendon, which is essentially in line with the tendon fibers. This was just proximal to the PIP joint and on complete flexion of the PIP joint, I did separate just a little bit that was not thought to be significantly dynamically unstable. It was sutured with a single 4-0 Prolene interrupted figure-of-eight suture and on dynamic motion it did not separate at all. The wound was irrigated and closed with 5-0 nylon interrupted sutures. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the PCU in good condition.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The back of the patient’s left little finger was cut, damaging the tendon that straightens the finger.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as before – the tendon was cut.  \nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: The damaged tendon was repaired.  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None.  \nBLOOD LOSS: Very little.  \nANESTHESIA: Bier block (a local block that numbs the arm).  \nINDICATIONS: A 14‑year‑old boy who uses his right hand more than his left cut the back of his left little finger, creating a small cut in the tendon that straightens the finger.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The boy was taken to the operating room, laid on his back, and given a Bier block to numb his arm. The area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The old cut was opened and the tendon was found. The tendon had a small, straight cut just above the middle joint of the finger. When the finger was fully bent, the cut was only slightly separated, so it was not considered unstable. The surgeon stitched the tendon back together with a single 4‑0 Prolene stitch in a figure‑of‑eight pattern. When the finger was moved, the stitch stayed in place. The wound was washed and closed with 5‑0 nylon stitches. The boy tolerated the surgery well and was sent to the recovery unit in good condition."
