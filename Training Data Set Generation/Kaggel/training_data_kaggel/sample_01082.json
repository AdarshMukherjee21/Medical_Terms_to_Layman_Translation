Diagnostic laparoscopy. 2. Laparoscopic appendectomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and injectable 1% lidocaine and 0.25% Marcaine. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. SPECIMEN: Appendix. COMPLICATIONS: None. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old Caucasian female presented to ABCD General Hospital with progressively worsening suprapubic and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which progressed throughout its course starting approximately 12 hours prior to presentation. She admits to some nausea associated with it. There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms. The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant. She had a leukocytosis of 12.8. She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis. Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy. The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged. The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts. There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes. The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV. After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle. Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg. Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty. A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored. Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region. This was inserted under direct visualization. Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created. This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision. A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region. This was done again under direct visualization. Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum. This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly. Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device. Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device. The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding. The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. The abdomen was then aspirated. There was no evidence of bleeding. All ports were removed under direct visualization. No evidence of bleeding from the port sites. The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed. The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle. Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl. The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition. She will be admitted to General Medical Floor and she will be followed closely in the early postoperative course.",

Diagnostic laparoscopy (looking inside the belly with a camera).  \n2. Laparoscopic removal of the appendix.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia with a breathing tube, plus local lidocaine and Marcaine injections.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:**  \nVery little.\n\n**Specimen taken:**  \nAppendix.\n\n**Complications:**  \nNone.\n\n---\n\n### Brief history  \nA 37‑year‑old white woman came to ABCD General Hospital with worsening pain in the lower right belly and the area just below the belly button. The pain started about 12 hours before she arrived. She also felt a little nauseous but had no fever, chills, or urinary problems. On exam she had tenderness that worsened when pressed and when the doctor pressed on the area. Her white‑blood‑cell count was 12.8 (high). A CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis did not clearly show an inflamed appendix. Because her pain was severe and did not improve, the doctors recommended a diagnostic laparoscopy, and if needed, removal of the appendix. She was told about the risks and benefits, gave her consent, and the surgery was performed.\n\n---\n\n### Operative findings  \nDuring the laparoscopy the doctors saw the appendix filled with pus and a little swollen. The left ovary had some small cysts, but there were no ovarian or fallopian‑tube problems. The uterus was normal. The rest of the belly looked fine.\n\n---\n\n### Operative procedure  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, laid on her back, and the belly was cleaned with Betadine. She was put under general anesthesia and given a pre‑op dose of Ancef (an antibiotic). After she was sedated, a small cut was made below the belly button and a needle was used to create a small space inside the belly. Air was pumped in to lift the belly wall, and a camera was inserted. Two more small ports were placed: one on the right side and one just above the pubic bone. The appendix was pulled out of the way with a small instrument. A stapling device was used to cut and seal the appendix and its blood vessels. The area was washed with lots of normal saline, and no bleeding was seen. All the ports were removed, and the small cuts were closed with stitches. The skin was cleaned, strips were put over the wound, and a sterile dressing was applied. The patient recovered well, was taken off the breathing tube, and was sent to the recovery area in stable condition. She will stay on the general medical floor and will be closely monitored after the surgery."
