  "medical": "EXAM: CT maxillofacial for trauma. FINDINGS: CT examination of the maxillofacial bones was performed without contrast. Coronal reconstructions were obtained for better anatomical localization. There is normal appearance to the orbital rims. The ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses are clear. There is polypoid mucosal thickening involving the floor of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. There is soft tissue or fluid opacification of the ostiomeatal complexes bilaterally. The nasal bones appear intact. The zygomatic arches are intact. The temporomandibular joints are intact and demonstrate no dislocations or significant degenerative changes. The mandible and maxilla are intact. There is soft tissue swelling seen involving the right cheek. IMPRESSION: 1. Mucosal thickening versus mucous retention cyst involving the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. There is also soft tissue or fluid opacification of the ostiomeatal complexes bilaterally. 2. Mild soft tissue swelling about the right cheek.",
  "layman": "EXAM: CT scan of the face after a blow. FINDINGS: The scan was done without dye and included side‑by‑side images to help see the bones clearly. The eye sockets look normal. The sinuses in the forehead, cheekbones, and behind the nose are clear. Both maxillary sinuses (the large air spaces behind the cheeks) have thickened lining that looks like polyps. The openings that drain these sinuses (ostiomeatal complexes) are filled with fluid or thick tissue on both sides. The nasal bones and cheekbones are intact. The jaw joints (temporomandibular joints) are normal, with no dislocation or major wear. The lower jaw (mandible) and upper jaw (maxilla) are intact. There is swelling of the soft tissue in the right cheek. IMPRESSION: 1. Thickened lining or possible mucus cysts in both maxillary sinuses, plus fluid or thick tissue in the drainage openings on both sides. 2. Mild swelling of the right cheek."
