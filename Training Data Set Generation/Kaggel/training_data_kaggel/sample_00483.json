PROCEDURES: Bilateral inguinal hernia and bilateral hydrocele repair with an ilioinguinal nerve block bilaterally by surgeon 20 mL given. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Same as above. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 400 mL of Crystalloid. DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. COUNT: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with the history of fairly sizeable right inguinal hernia and hydrocele, was found to have a second smaller one on evaluation with ultrasound and physical exam. Plan is for repair of both. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. A right inguinal incision was then made with 15 blade knife and further extended with electrocautery down to the subcutaneous tissue and electrocautery was also used for hemostasis. The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal. The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture. This was done twice. The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision. The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field. The sac was then opened completely around the testis. The appendix testis was cauterized. We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture. Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation. Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely. Again both testes were placed into the scrotum after the hydroceles were treated and then the external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and the cord structures not involved in the closure. Scarpa fascia was closed with 4-0 chromic suture on each side and the skin was closed with 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions. IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure and both testes were well descended within the scrotum at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** The boy had a hernia and a fluid collection (hydrocele) on both sides of his groin.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same as before.  \n\n**What was done:** The surgeon repaired the hernias and hydroceles on both sides. The patient received a nerve block on each side (20 mL of medication) and general anesthesia.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** General inhaled anesthetic.  \n\n**Other notes:**  \n- Blood loss was less than 5 mL.  \n- 400 mL of fluid was given.  \n- No drains were placed.  \n- All surgical sponges and needles were counted correctly.  \n\n**Why the surgery was needed:** A 7‑year‑old boy had a large right groin hernia and fluid collection. An ultrasound and exam found a smaller left‑side hernia. The plan was to fix both.  \n\n**What happened during the operation:**  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room, checked for the right patient and site, and put under general anesthesia. He was laid on his back and the area was cleaned and covered.  \n\nA small cut was made on the right side with a knife and extended with a small electric cautery tool to stop bleeding. The outer layer of the abdominal wall was cut open. Using a clamp, the surgeon carefully reached into the groin canal, found the hernia sac, and pulled it out. The sac was tied off in the middle and cut, then the fluid collection was opened and drained. The testicle was moved out, the fluid sac was opened around it, and the small appendix of the testicle was cauterized. The fluid sac was then wrapped around the back of the testicle and secured with a figure‑of‑eight stitch. The testicle was put back into the scrotum in the correct position. A nerve block and wound medication were applied.  \n\nThe same steps were repeated on the left side, where a smaller hernia was found and tied off, and the fluid sac was treated the same way. After both sides were finished, the outer abdominal wall was closed with a running stitch, the deeper layer was closed with another stitch, and the skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch. A skin adhesive was applied to both cuts. The patient received pain medication before leaving the operating room. Both testicles were in the scrotum and the boy was stable when he was sent to recovery."
