On April 14 he had a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and was sent back to the nursing home that same day with better urination. The final diagnosis was prostate cancer (adenocarcinoma). Because he has mental and physical weakness, his family chose not to do more treatment.  \n\nLABORATORY: None  \n\nPROCEDURES:  \n- Cystoscopy: The urethra was blocked by a very enlarged prostate.  \n- TURP: 45 grams of prostate tissue were sent to the Pathology Department.  \n\nPATHOLOGY: The tissue showed a well‑differentiated, microacinar type prostate cancer in 1 of 25 tissue samples."
