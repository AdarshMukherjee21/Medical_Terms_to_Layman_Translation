Independent medical examination - occupational health. ASSESSMENT: Please review the records forwarded to you and thereafter please undertake your usual thorough physical examination of this patient. Please prepare a report directed to my attention and addressing the following issues. QUESTION: Based upon the examination of the claimant, review of the records, information, experience, and expertise, has the claimant reached maximum medical improvement with respect to the allowed conditions in this claim? ANSWER: It is my opinion based upon the allowed condition in the claim that the injured worker has indeed maximum medical improvement. QUESTION: In your opinion, based upon review of the records and your examination of the claimant, your experience and expertise, what if any, further treatment is reasonably related and medically necessary with respect to the allowed conditions in the claim? ANSWER: The injured worker has undergone a right total knee replacement arthroplasty in December 2008. This procedure has corrected the instability that was indeed present. Based upon the allowed conditions of the claim, no further treatment is medically necessary and reasonably related with respect to the allowed conditions of the claim. Any treatment that he does indeed receive will be for non-allowed conditions. QUESTION: In your opinion, based upon review of the records, your examination of the claimant, and your experience and expertise, is it medically necessary and reasonably related to the allowed conditions for the claimant to have a functional capacity evaluation at this time? ANSWER: Based upon the allowed conditions of the claim, it is not reasonably necessary and appropriate and reasonably related to the allowed conditions for the claimant to have a functional capacity evaluation. QUESTION: If you feel that functional capacity evaluation is medically necessary in this claim, does this affect your opinion with regards to maximum medical improvement and if so, how? ANSWER: Once again, it is my opinion that a functional capacity evaluation is not medically necessary and/or reasonable related to the allowed conditions of the claim. As mentioned, the injured worker has indeed reached maximum medical improvement for the allowed conditions of the claim. There is really no indication for a functional capacity evaluation based upon the allowed conditions of the claim etc. This information is based upon review of the medical records, independent medical examination performed. If you have any further questions as related to this evaluation, please feel free to contact my office.",
  "layman": "Mr. XXXX says he had surgery on his right knee and the reconstruction failed because a screw came loose.

After that he did a long course of physical therapy, work‑hardening, and a work‑conditioning program.\n\nToday he still has a lot of pain and swelling in his right knee. He cannot crawl or kneel. He can walk a city block and can do 20 minutes on a treadmill. Stairs are a big problem. His pain is 5–6 out of 10. It is better when he is resting, sitting, propped up, and using ice.

Jan 17, 2003 – right ACL reconstruction with hamstring allograft (Dr. Musgrave).  \n10. Oct 15, 2003 – MRI showed the ACL graft looked good, no new problems.  \n11. May 19, 2004 – revision arthroscopic ACL with tibialis anterior ligament and medial meniscectomy.  \n12. Sep 16, 2004 – MRI showed no tear of the ACL graft, no meniscal problems.  \n13. Independent exam by Dr. Z.  \n14. Independent exam by Dr. A.  \n15. Mar 17, 2008 – harvest of patellar tendon graft and revision of previous ACL reconstruction.  \n16.
