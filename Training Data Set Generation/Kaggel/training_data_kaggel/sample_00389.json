  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Volar laceration to right ring finger with possible digital nerve injury with possible flexor tendon injury. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Laceration to right ring finger with partial laceration to the ulnar slip of the FDS which is the flexor digitorum superficialis. 2. 25% laceration to the flexor digitorum profundus of the right ring finger and laceration 100% of the ulnar digital nerve to the right ring finger. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Repair of nerve and tendon, right ring finger. 2. Exploration of digital laceration. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 cc. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 57 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 13-year-old male who had sustained a laceration from glass and had described numbness and tingling in his right ring finger. GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: After wound exploration, it was found there was a 100% laceration to the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle. The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well. The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. All bony prominences were adequately padded. Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time. The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The hand was inspected. Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture. The sutures were removed and the wound was explored. It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected. The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact. We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP. We copiously irrigated the wound. Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture. The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact. Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair. Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury. The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve. The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture. The hands were well approximated. The nerve was not under undue tension. The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture. Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed. The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition. Overall prognosis is good.",

Cut on the inside of the right ring finger with a partial cut to the part of the tendon that helps bend the finger (the flexor digitorum superficialis).  \n2. 25 % cut to the deeper tendon that bends the finger (flexor digitorum profundus) and a complete cut to the nerve that supplies feeling to the finger.\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED  \n1. Repair of the nerve and tendon in the right ring finger.  \n2. Exploration of the cut.\n\nANESTHESIA  \nGeneral.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  \nLess than 10 cc.\n\nTOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME  \n57 minutes.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS  \nNone.\n\nDISPOSITION  \nSent to the recovery area (PACU) in stable condition.\n\nBRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  \nA 13‑year‑old boy cut his right ring finger on glass. He felt numbness and tingling in that finger.\n\nGROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS  \nWhen the surgeon looked inside the wound, the nerve and blood vessels on the ulnar side of the finger were completely cut. The tendon that helps bend the finger had a partial cut on the side that goes toward the little finger, and the deeper tendon had a 25 % cut. The radial side of the finger (toward the thumb) was intact.\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. All bony points were padded with a material called Webril. A tourniquet was placed on his right arm but not tightened yet. The arm was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The hand was examined. On the palm side, there was about a half‑centimeter cut at the base of the right ring finger. The cut was stitched with nylon. The stitches were removed and the wound was opened. The surgeon found that the nerve and blood vessels on the ulnar side were completely cut. The radial side was intact. The surgeon examined the tendons and found a partial cut to the ulnar slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis and a 25 % cut to the flexor digitorum profundus. The wound was washed thoroughly. The flexor digitorum superficialis was repaired with a #3‑0 undyed Ethibond suture. The flexor digitorum profundus was not repaired because most of it was still intact. The surgeon cut open the A1 pulley to see the tendon better and to allow it to move after repair. The surgeon then worked on the cut nerve. The nerve was pulled back a little on both sides to see it. The nerve was stitched together with a microvascular technique using a #8‑0 nylon suture. The hand was put back together. The nerve was not under tension. The wound was washed again and the skin was closed with a #4‑0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress stitch alternating with simple stitches. A sterile dressing was applied and a dorsal extension box splint was put on the hand. The boy was moved from the bed to a gurney and taken to the recovery area in stable condition. The overall outlook is good."
