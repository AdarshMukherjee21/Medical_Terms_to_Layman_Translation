  "medical": "REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work in December 2009. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis. Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound. She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm. She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct. She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP. On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture. Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization. She was also noted to have an elevated CA99. She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation. After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye for a muscle repair. Other surgeries include left ankle surgery for a fractured ankle in 2000. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Diovan 80/12.5 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Lutein 20 mg daily, folic acid 0.8 mg daily and multivitamin daily. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for heart disease. She had three brothers that died of complications from open heart surgery. Her parents and brothers all had hypertension. Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop. He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours. She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia. She has two adult sons who are in good health. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years. Her first husband died in 1995. She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed. She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well. She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms. As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup. She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure. She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats. She has had loose stools. The rest of her review of systems is negative. PHYSICAL EXAM: VITALS: BP: 108/60. HEART RATE: 80. TEMP: 98.5. Weight: 75 kg. GEN: She is a very pleasant female, in no acute distress. HEENT: She has obvious strabismus of the left eye with medial deviation. Her pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx is clear. NECK: Supple. She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CV: Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. No palpable masses. No hepatosplenomegaly. EXT: Lower extremities are without edema. LABORATORY STUDIES: Sodium 141, glucose 111, total bilirubin 2.3, alkaline phosphatase 941, AST 161, and ALT 220. White blood cell count 4.3, hemoglobin 11.6, hematocrit 35, and platelets 156,000. Total bilirubin from August 25, 2010 was 1.6, alkaline phosphatase 735, AST 123, ALT 184, CA99 is 109. Bile duct brushings are notable for atypical cell clusters present, highly suspicious for carcinoma. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who has findings suspicious for a cholangiocarcinoma. The patient was referred to our office to discuss this diagnosis. I spent greater than an hour with the patient and her husband discussing this potential diagnosis, reviewing the anatomy and answering questions. She is yet to have a surgical consultation, and we discussed the difficulty that we sometimes have with patients meeting surgical criteria to manage cholangiocarcinoma. The patient also had questions about the Medical University and possibly seeking a second opinion. She will contact our office after her surgical consultation if she needs assistance with obtaining a second opinion. We also talked about our clinical research program here. Currently, we do have a Phase II Study for advanced gallbladder carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma for patients that are unresectable. We will go ahead and provide her with a consent form so that she can look that over and it will give her some more information about the malignancy and treatment approaches. We will schedule her for followup in three weeks. We will also schedule her for PET/CT scan for staging.",

An abdominal ultrasound showed sludge in her gallbladder and changes called adenomyomatosis. The common bile duct was 10 mm wide. A CT scan in July 2010 showed the bile ducts inside the liver were swollen and the common bile duct was 12.7 mm. An MRI of the bile ducts (MRCP) found a narrowing (stricture) in the lower part of the common bile duct. She was referred to a gastroenterologist and had an ERCP (a procedure that looks inside the bile ducts). On August 24, 2010, the ERCP showed a narrowing mass in the mid‑to‑upper common bile duct that looked like cancer. A temporary stent was placed to keep the duct open. Blood tests during the hospital stay showed a high CA‑19‑9 level, a marker that can be high in bile duct cancer. She came to the clinic today for her first oncology appointment. After seeing me, she will meet with a surgeon.\n\n**Past medical history:**  \n- High blood pressure and high cholesterol.  \n- In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye to repair a muscle.  \n- She had ankle surgery for a broken ankle in 2000.\n\n**Current medications:**  \n- Diovan 80 mg/12.5 mg daily  \n- Lipitor 10 mg daily  \n- Lutein 20 mg daily  \n- Folic acid 0.8 mg daily  \n- Multivitamin daily\n\n**Allergies:**  \nNone known.\n\n**Family history:**  \nHeart disease runs in the family. Three brothers died from complications after open heart surgery. Parents and brothers had high blood pressure. A younger brother died at 18 from an infection after cutting beef in a butcher’s shop. One brother is alive and has chest pain (angina). A sister, 84, has dementia. Two adult sons are healthy.\n\n**Social history:**  \nShe has been married to her second husband for ten years. Her first husband died in 1995. She never smoked and does not drink alcohol.\n\n**Review of systems:**  \nShe reports changes in her bowel movements since the stent was placed. She has lost some weight, which she says is because she isn’t eating well. She feels a little tired. Before her diagnosis she had no symptoms. She had abnormal liver enzymes and bilirubin that led to follow‑up tests. She had some vision problems that improved after her eye surgery. She denies fever, chills, night sweats. She has loose stools. No other symptoms.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- **Vitals:** BP 108/60, heart rate 80, temperature 98.5 °F, weight 75 kg.  \n- **General:** Friendly, no acute distress.  \n- **Head/eyes:** Left eye has a noticeable misalignment (strabismus). Pupils equal, round, and react to light. Mouth clear.  \n- **Neck:** Soft, no swollen lymph nodes.  \n- **Lungs:** Clear.  \n- **Heart:** Regular rhythm, normal heart sounds, no murmurs.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, not tender, no swelling, no liver or spleen enlargement.  \n- **Extremities:** No swelling in legs.\n\n**Laboratory studies:**  \n- Sodium 141, glucose 111, total bilirubin 2.3, alkaline phosphatase 941, AST 161, ALT 220.  \n- White blood cells 4.3, hemoglobin 11.6, hematocrit 35, platelets 156,000.  \n- On August 25, 2010: bilirubin 1.6, alkaline phosphatase 735, AST 123, ALT 184, CA‑19‑9 109.  \n- Bile duct brushings showed atypical cells, highly suspicious for cancer.\n\n**Assessment/Plan:**  \nThe patient has findings that strongly suggest bile duct cancer. She was referred to our office to discuss the diagnosis. I spent over an hour talking with her and her husband about the possible cancer, the anatomy, and answering questions. She has not yet seen a surgeon; we discussed how sometimes patients may not meet the criteria for surgery. She asked about the medical university and possibly getting a second opinion. She will contact us after her surgical appointment if she needs help with a second opinion. We also talked about our clinical research program. We have a Phase II study for advanced gallbladder or bile duct cancer that is not operable. I will give her a consent form to review for more information about the disease and treatment options. We will schedule a follow‑up in three weeks and arrange a PET/CT scan for staging."
