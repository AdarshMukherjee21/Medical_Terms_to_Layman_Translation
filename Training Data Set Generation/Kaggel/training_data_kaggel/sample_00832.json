The patient understood, gave consent, was taken to the procedure room, and connected to the necessary monitoring equipment. Versed and fentanyl were given in small doses.

A photo was taken at the cecum and the scope was slowly pulled back. After the procedure, the colonoscope was removed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition. No complications occurred."
