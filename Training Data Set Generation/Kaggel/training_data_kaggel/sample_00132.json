  "medical": "EXAM: Renal ultrasound. HISTORY: Renal failure, neurogenic bladder, status-post cystectomy. TECHNIQUE: Multiple ultrasonographic images of the kidneys were obtained in the transverse and longitudinal planes. COMPARISON: Most recently obtained mm/dd/yy. FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12 x 5.2 x 4.6 cm and the left kidney measures 12.2 x 6.2 x 4.4 cm. The imaged portions of the kidneys fail to demonstrate evidence of mass, hydronephrosis or calculus. There is no evidence of cortical thinning. Incidentally there is a rounded low-attenuation mass within the inferior aspect of the right lobe of the liver measuring 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.9 cm which has suggestion of some peripheral blood flow. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of hydronephrosis. 2. Mass within the right lobe of the liver. The patient apparently has a severe iodine allergy. Further evaluation with MRI is recommended. 3. The results of this examination were given to XXX in Dr. XXX office on mm/dd/yy at XXX",

The parts of the kidneys we could see show no tumors, no swelling from urine backup, and no stones. The kidney tissue looks normal. We also found a round, soft spot in the lower part of the right side of the liver that is 2.1 × 1.5 × 1.9 cm and appears to have some blood flow around it.  \nIMPRESSION: 1. No swelling from urine backup in the kidneys.  \n2. A spot in the right side of the liver that may need more checking. Because the patient has a severe iodine allergy, an MRI is recommended instead of a CT scan.  \n3. The results were given to XXX in Dr. XXX’s office on mm/dd/yy at XXX."
