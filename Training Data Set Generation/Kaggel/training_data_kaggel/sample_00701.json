  "medical": "TITLE OF OPERATION: Intramedullary nail fixation of the left tibia fracture with a Stryker T2 tibial nail, 10 x 390 with a one 5-mm proximal locking screw and three 5-mm distal locking screws (CPT code is 27759) (the ICD-9 code again is 823.2 for a tibial shaft fracture). INDICATION FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 19-year-old male, who sustained a gunshot wound to the left tibia with a distal tibial shaft fracture. The patient was admitted and splinted and had compartment checks. The risks of surgery were discussed in detail including, but not limited to infection, bleeding, injuries to nerves, or vital structures, nonunion or malunion, need for reoperation, compartment syndrome, and the risk of anesthesia. The patient understood these risks and wished to proceed. PREOP DIAGNOSIS: Left tibial shaft fracture status post gunshot wound (CPT code 27759). POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: Left tibial shaft fracture status post gunshot wound (CPT code 27759). ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. INTRAVENOUS FLUID: 900. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: Stable to PACU. PROCEDURE DETAIL: The patient was met in the preoperative holding area and operative site was marked. The patient was brought to the operating room and given preoperative antibiotics. Left leg was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline incision was made in the center of the knee and was carried down sharply to the retinacular tissue. The starting guidewire was used to localize the correct starting point, which is on the medial aspect of the lateral tibial eminence. This was advanced and confirmed on the AP and lateral fluoroscopic images. The opening reamer was then used and the ball-tip guidewire was passed. The reduction was obtained over a large radiolucent triangle. After passing the guidewire and achieving appropriate reduction, the flexible reamers were then sequentially passed, starting at 9 mm up to 11.5 mm reamer. At this point, a 10 x 390 mm was passed without difficulty. The guide was used to the proximal locking screw and the appropriate circle technique was used to the distal locking screws. The final images were taken with fluoroscopy and a 15-mm end-cap was placed. The wounds were then irrigated and closed with 2-0 Vicryl followed by staples to the distal screws and 0 Vicryl followed 2-0 Vicryl and staples to the proximal incision. The patient was placed in a short leg, well-padded splint, was awakened and taken to recovery in good condition. The plan will be nonweightbearing left lower extremity. He will be placed in a short leg splint and should be transitioned to a short leg cast for the next 4 weeks.",
  "layman": "**Operation Title:**  \nFixation of a broken left shin bone (tibia) with an intramedullary nail. A Stryker T2 tibial nail (10 mm wide, 390 mm long) was used, with one 5‑mm screw near the top of the bone and three 5‑mm screws near the bottom. (Procedure code 27759, diagnosis code 823.2 for a tibial shaft fracture.)\n\n**Why the surgery was needed:**  \nA 19‑year‑old man had a gunshot wound that broke the middle part of his left shin. He was admitted, splinted, and checked for compartment pressure. The surgeon explained the risks of the operation—such as infection, bleeding, nerve or other tissue damage, the bone not healing properly, the need for another surgery, compartment syndrome, and anesthesia risks. The patient understood these risks and chose to have the surgery.\n\n**Pre‑op diagnosis:**  \nLeft tibial shaft fracture from a gunshot wound (code 27759).\n\n**Post‑op diagnosis:**  \nSame as pre‑op.\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nGeneral anesthesia with an endotracheal tube.\n\n**IV fluids given:** 900 mL.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:** 100 mL.\n\n**Complications:** None.\n\n**Disposition:** Patient was stable and sent to the post‑anesthesia care unit (PACU).\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient was prepared in the pre‑op area and the surgical site was marked. He was taken to the operating room and given antibiotics before the operation. The left leg was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A straight incision was made in the middle of the knee and cut down to the retinacular tissue. A guidewire was used to find the correct starting point on the inside of the tibial eminence. Its position was confirmed with X‑ray images from front and side views. A reamer was used to open the bone, and a ball‑tip guidewire was passed. The bone was aligned using a large radiolucent triangle. After the guidewire was in place and the bone was properly aligned, flexible reamers of increasing size (9 mm to 11.5 mm) were passed. Then the 10 mm by 390 mm nail was inserted without difficulty. The guide was used to place the proximal locking screw, and the circle technique was used for the distal screws. Final X‑ray images were taken, and a 15‑mm end‑cap was attached. The wound was washed and closed with 2‑0 Vicryl sutures, followed by staples to the distal screws, and 0 Vicryl and 2‑0 Vicryl with staples to the proximal incision. The patient was fitted with a short leg splint, awakened, and taken to recovery in good condition.\n\n**Post‑op plan:**  \nThe patient will not bear weight on the left leg. He will stay in a short leg splint and then switch to a short leg cast for the next four weeks."
