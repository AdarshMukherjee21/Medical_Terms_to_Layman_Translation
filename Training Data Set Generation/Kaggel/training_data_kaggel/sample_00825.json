  "medical": "REASON FOR VISIT: Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old noted to have microscopic hematuria with overactive bladder. Her cystoscopy performed was unremarkable. She continues to have some episodes of frequency and urgency mostly with episodes during the day and rare at night. No gross hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, no other outlet obstructive and/or irritative voiding symptoms. The patient had been previously on Ditropan and did not do nearly as well. At this point, what we will try is a different medication. Renal ultrasound is otherwise unremarkable, notes no evidence of any other disease. IMPRESSION: Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria most likely some mild atrophic vaginitis is noted. She has no other significant findings other than her overactive bladder, which had continued. At this juncture what I would like to do is try a different anticholinergic medication. She has never had any side effects from her medication. PLAN: The patient will discontinue Ditropan. We will start Sanctura XR and we will follow up as scheduled. Otherwise we will continue to follow her urinalysis over the next year or so.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:** The patient has an overactive bladder and tiny amounts of blood in her urine that can only be seen under a microscope.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nA 56‑year‑old woman has microscopic blood in her urine and an overactive bladder. A cystoscopy (a camera exam of the bladder) showed nothing abnormal. She still has frequent and urgent urination, mainly during the day and rarely at night. She does not have visible blood in her urine, pain when urinating, white blood cells in the urine, or other blockage or irritation symptoms. She had tried Ditropan before but it didn’t work well. We will try a different medicine now. A kidney ultrasound was normal and showed no other problems.\n\n**Impression:**  \nThe main issues are an overactive bladder and microscopic blood in the urine, probably due to mild vaginal thinning (atrophic vaginitis). No other serious findings were found. We plan to switch to a different anticholinergic drug. She has never had side effects from her medication.\n\n**Plan:**  \nThe patient will stop taking Ditropan. We will start her on Sanctura XR and keep her appointments as scheduled. We will also keep checking her urine tests for the next year or so."
