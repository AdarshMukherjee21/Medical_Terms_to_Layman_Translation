  "medical": "CIRCUMCISION - NEONATAL PROCEDURE:: The procedure, risks and benefits were explained to the patient's mom, and a consent form was signed. She is aware of the risk of bleeding, infection, meatal stenosis, excess or too little foreskin removed and the possible need for revision in the future. The infant was placed on the papoose board. The external genitalia were prepped with Betadine. A penile block was performed with a 30-gauge needle and 1.5 mL of Nesacaine without epinephrine. Next, the foreskin was clamped at the 12 o'clock position back to the appropriate proximal extent of the circumcision on the dorsum of the penis. The incision was made. Next, all the adhesions of the inner preputial skin were broken down. The appropriate size bell was obtained and placed over the glans penis. The Gomco clamp was then configured, and the foreskin was pulled through the opening of the Gomco. The bell was then placed and tightened down. Prior to do this, the penis was viewed circumferentially, and there was no excess of skin gathered, particularly in the area of the ventrum. A blade was used to incise circumferentially around the bell. The bell was removed. There was no significant bleeding, and a good cosmetic result was evident with the appropriate amount of skin removed. Vaseline gauze was then placed. The little boy was given back to his mom. PLAN: They have a new baby checkup in the near future with their primary care physician. I will see them back on a p.r.n. basis if there are any problems with the circumcision.",
  "layman": "**Neonatal Circumcision**\n\nThe doctor explained the procedure, its risks and benefits to the mother, and she signed a consent form. She knows that the baby could bleed, get an infection, develop a narrow opening (meatal stenosis), have too much or too little foreskin removed, and might need another surgery later.\n\nThe baby was placed on a papoose board. The genital area was cleaned with Betadine. A local anesthetic (Nesacaine, 1.5 mL, no epinephrine) was injected with a 30‑gauge needle. The foreskin was clamped at the top (12 o’clock) and pulled back to the correct length for the circumcision. The incision was made, and the inner skin was separated from the rest of the foreskin. A bell of the right size was put over the head of the penis. The Gomco clamp was set up, and the foreskin was pulled through the clamp’s opening. The bell was tightened. The doctor checked the penis all around to make sure no extra skin was left, especially on the underside. A blade was used to cut around the bell. The bell was removed. There was no major bleeding, and the result looked good with the right amount of skin removed. Vaseline gauze was placed over the area. The baby was given back to his mother.\n\n**Plan**  \nThe baby will have a routine check‑up soon with his primary care doctor. The doctor will see the family as needed if any problems with the circumcision arise."
