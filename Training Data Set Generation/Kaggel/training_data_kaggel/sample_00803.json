  "medical": "EXAM: CT cervical spine (C-spine) for trauma. FINDINGS: CT examination of the cervical spine was performed without contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained for better anatomical localization. Cervical vertebral body height, alignment and interspacing are maintained. There is no evidence of fractures or destructive osseous lesions. There are no significant degenerative endplate or facet changes. No significant osseous central canal or foraminal narrowing is present. IMPRESSION: Negative cervical spine.",

The height, alignment, and spacing of the vertebrae are normal. There are no fractures or bone damage. The ends of the vertebrae and the joint areas show no major wear. The central canal and the openings where nerves exit are not narrowed. IMPRESSION: No problems found with the cervical spine."
