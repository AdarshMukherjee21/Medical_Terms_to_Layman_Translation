  "medical": "PROCEDURES 1. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. 2. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression. 3. Arthroscopic extensive debridement, superior labrum anterior and posterior tear. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic. Once the patient was under general anesthetic, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed. It revealed no patholigamentous laxity. The patient was then carefully positioned into a beach-chair position. We maintained the natural alignment of the head, neck, and thorax at all times. The shoulder and upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Once we fully prepped and draped, we then began the surgery. We injected the glenohumeral joint with sterile saline with a spinal needle. This consisted of 60 cc of fluid. We then made a posterior incision for our portal, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion. Through this incision, a blunt trocar and cannula were placed in the glenohumeral joint. Through the cannula, a camera was placed; and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline through a preoperative feed. We then carefully examined the glenohumeral joint. We found the articular surface to be in good condition. There was a superior labral tear (SLAP). This was extensively debrided using a shaver through an anterior portal. We also found a full thickness rotator cuff tear. We then drained the glenohumeral joint. We redirected our camera into the subacromial space. An anterolateral portal was made, both superior and inferior. We then proceeded to perform a subacromial decompression using high-speed shaver. The bursa was extensively debrided. We then abraded the bone over the footprint of where the rotator cuff is usually attached. The corkscrew anchors were used to perform a rotator cuff repair. Pictures were taken. Through a separate incision, an indwelling pain catheter was then placed. It was carefully positioned. Pictures were taken. We then drained the joint. All instruments were removed. The patient did receive IV antibiotic preoperatively. All portals were closed using 4-0 nylon sutures. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and OpSite were applied over the pain pump. ABD, tape, and a sling were also applied. A Cryo/Cuff was also placed over the shoulder. The patient was taken out of the beach-chair position maintaining the neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax. The patient was extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then went out and spoke with the family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.",
  "layman": "**Procedures performed**\n\n1. Arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff.  \n2. Arthroscopic removal of excess tissue from the space under the acromion (subacromial decompression).  \n3. Arthroscopic cleaning of the joint and repair of a tear in the superior labrum (SLAP tear).\n\n**Procedure in detail**\n\nAfter the patient gave written consent, she was taken back to the operating room. She was laid on her back on the table and given general anesthesia. While she was asleep, the surgeon examined her shoulder and found no looseness of the ligaments. She was then carefully positioned in a “beach‑chair” position, keeping her head, neck, and chest aligned. The shoulder and arm were cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.\n\nThe surgeon injected 60 cc of sterile salt water into the shoulder joint with a spinal needle. A small incision was made 2 cm below and 2 cm inside the back corner of the acromion to create a portal. Through this portal a blunt trocar and cannula were inserted into the joint. A camera was placed through the cannula, and more sterile fluid was pumped into the joint to keep it clear. The surgeon looked inside and saw that the joint surface was in good condition but found a tear in the superior labrum (SLAP tear). The tear was cleaned with a shaver through an anterior portal. A full‑thickness tear of the rotator cuff was also found. The joint was drained of fluid.\n\nThe camera was moved into the space under the acromion. Two more portals were made, one above and one below the acromion. A high‑speed shaver was used to remove excess tissue (debridement) and to widen the space (decompression). The bursa was cleaned and the bone where the rotator cuff normally attaches was abraded. Corkscrew anchors were used to reattach the rotator cuff. Photos were taken.\n\nA separate small incision was made to place an indwelling pain catheter. The catheter was positioned carefully and photos were taken. The joint was drained again, all instruments were removed, and the patient received a pre‑operative IV antibiotic.\n\nAll portals were closed with 4‑0 nylon sutures. A Xeroform dressing, 4 × 4 cm, and OpSite were applied over the pain pump. An abduction brace, tape, and a sling were also applied. A Cryo/Cuff (cold pack) was placed over the shoulder. The patient was taken out of the beach‑chair position while keeping her head, neck, and chest neutral. She was taken off the breathing tube and moved to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nAfter the surgery, the surgeon spoke with the patient’s family, explained what was done, gave postoperative instructions, and discussed follow‑up care."
