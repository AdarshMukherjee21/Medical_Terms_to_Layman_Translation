  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis with perforation. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis with perforation. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 4-year-old little boy, who has been sick for several days and was seen in our Emergency Department yesterday where a diagnosis of possible constipation was made, but he was sent home with a prescription for polyethylene glycol but became more acutely ill and returned today with tachycardia, high fever and signs of peritonitis. A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation. He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process. He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration. I met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options. All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia. A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion. A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion. We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure. A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia. CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized. There was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum. After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix. In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix. The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port. I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system. When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible. The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated the operation well. He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. His blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the procedure.",

He was seen in the Emergency Department (ED) yesterday and was thought to have constipation. He was sent home with a laxative (polyethylene glycol) but got worse. Today he came back with a fast heart rate, high fever, and signs that the inside of his belly was inflamed (peritonitis). A CT scan showed that his appendix had burst. In the ED he was put on the “appendicitis critical pathway” and given fluids because he was dehydrated and his heart was racing. I talked with Carlos’s parents about the diagnosis, the risks and benefits of surgery, and other treatment options. They had no questions left and agreed to the surgery.  \n\n**What the surgeon found during the operation:**  \nCarlos had a burst appendix and widespread infection in the belly. There were many small pockets of pus (abscesses) and pus in all parts of his abdomen, including near the liver and under the diaphragm.  \n\n**How the surgery was done:**  \nCarlos was taken to the operating room and put under general anesthesia without any problems. A urinary catheter was inserted to empty the bladder. His belly was cleaned and covered in the usual way. We injected a local anesthetic (Marcaine) around the belly button and where the surgical ports would go.  \n\nWe checked the patient’s identity and the plan for surgery.  \n\nA 1‑cm vertical cut was made below the belly button. We used an open technique to put a 12‑mm trocar (a small tube) through the belly button. CO₂ gas was pumped in to inflate the belly to 15 mmHg. Two more 5‑mm ports were placed in the areas that had been numbed.  \n\nThere was a lot of pus and scar tissue (adhesions) between the omentum (fatty apron) and the intestines and the belly wall. We gently separated these tissues and started to locate the appendix. Because the small intestine was very swollen, we used a low‑power hook cautery to cut the blood vessels (mesoappendix). The base of the appendix was tied off with 2‑0 PDS Endoloops, the appendix was cut and pulled out through the belly‑button port.  \n\nI spent about 10 minutes washing out the pus from the belly using 2 L of sterile fluid and a suction‑irrigation system. After the wash, the CO₂ was released and as much fluid as possible was drained. The belly‑button opening was closed with a figure‑of‑eight stitch of 0 Monocryl. The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 5‑0 Monocryl and Steri‑Strips.  \n\nCarlos tolerated the operation well. He woke up and was taken to recovery in good condition. Blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the surgery."
