  "medical": "EXAM: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast, stone protocol, reconstruction. REASON FOR EXAM: Flank pain. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis with coronal reconstructions. FINDINGS: There is no intrarenal stone bilaterally. However, there is very mild left renal pelvis and proximal ureteral dilatation with a small amount of left perinephric stranding asymmetric to the right. The right renal pelvis is not dilated. There is no stone along the course of the ureter. I cannot exclude the possibility of recent stone passage, although the findings are ultimately technically indeterminate and clinical correlation is advised. There is no obvious solid-appearing mass given the lack of contrast. Scans of the pelvis disclose no evidence of stone within the decompressed bladder. No pelvic free fluid or adenopathy. There are few scattered diverticula. There is a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon. There are scattered diverticula, but no CT evidence of acute diverticulitis. The appendix is normal. There are mild bibasilar atelectatic changes. Given the lack of contrast, visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas are grossly unremarkable. The gallbladder is present. There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy. There are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: 1.Very mild left renal pelvic dilatation and proximal ureteral dilatation with mild left perinephric stranding. There is no stone identified along the course of the left ureter or in the bladder. Could this patient be status post recent stone passage? Clinical correlation is advised. 2.Diverticulosis. 3.Moderate amount of stool throughout the colon. 4.Normal appendix.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast, using a stone‑focused protocol and reconstruction.  \n**Reason for Exam:** Flank pain.  \n**Technique:** Non‑contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis with coronal reconstructions.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- No kidney stones were seen in either kidney.  \n- The left kidney’s pelvis and the upper part of the left ureter are slightly enlarged, and there is a small amount of swelling around the left kidney that is not seen on the right side.  \n- The right kidney’s pelvis is normal.  \n- No stones were found along the ureters.  \n- It is possible that a stone has recently passed, but the images are not clear enough to be sure; follow‑up with a doctor is recommended.  \n- No obvious solid mass was seen because no contrast was used.  \n- The bladder shows no stones.  \n- No free fluid or swollen lymph nodes in the pelvis.  \n- A few small pouches (diverticula) are present in the colon, but there is no sign of acute inflammation.  \n- The appendix looks normal.  \n- Mild collapse of the lung bases is seen.  \n- The parts of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas that were visible look normal.  \n- The gallbladder is present.  \n- No free fluid or abnormal lymph nodes in the abdomen.  \n- The lower back spine shows degenerative changes.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Very mild enlargement of the left kidney’s pelvis and upper ureter with mild swelling around the left kidney; no stone was found in the left ureter or bladder. A recent stone passage cannot be ruled out; follow‑up with a clinician is advised.  \n2. Diverticulosis (small pouches in the colon).  \n3. Moderate amount of stool throughout the colon.  \n4. Normal appendix."
