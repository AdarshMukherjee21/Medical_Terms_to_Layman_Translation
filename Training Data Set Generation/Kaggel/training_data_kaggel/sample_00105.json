  "medical": "REASON FOR VISIT: Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07. Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain. She had not improved immediately postoperatively. She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw. We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw. Postoperatively, her pain had improved. I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well. She had symptoms of what she thought was &quot;restless leg syndrome&quot; at that time. She has been put on ReQuip for this. She returned. I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved. I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative. She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg. Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation. She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively. She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively. The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively. The right leg pain is improved. The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side. She denies any significant low back pain. No right lower extremity symptoms. No infectious symptoms whatsoever. No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath. No drainage from the wound. No difficulties with the incision. FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x 3. Normocephalic, atraumatic. Respirations are normal and nonlabored. Afebrile to touch. Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5. Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5. This has all been changed compared to preoperatively. Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5. Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot. Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally. The incision is well healed. There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever. No drainage. Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws. Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed. It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5. There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07. The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms. I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms. However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection. I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time. I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection. My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization. I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time. She is happy with this. I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible. She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested. I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management. I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve. She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit**  \nFollow‑up after surgery on the lower back (L4‑L5 laminectomy, foraminotomies, and spinal fusion with metal screws).\n\n**History of present illness**  \nMs. ABC came in for a follow‑up after her surgery on 06/08/07. Before the operation she had sharp pain in her left leg that ran down the leg. After the surgery her pain did not improve right away. The surgeon found that a screw on the right side of her L4 vertebra was not in the right place. She was taken back to the operating room that same night and the screw was put back in the correct spot. After that her pain got better.\n\nI last saw her on 06/28/07 and she was doing well. She had symptoms she thought were “restless leg syndrome” and was put on ReQuip. She came back and told me that her right leg pain had improved a lot. I had checked for a blood clot and the ultrasound was negative. She said she still had pain in her left leg, but it was in a different spot lower down the leg than before. I sent her for a lumbar spine X‑ray and MRI, and she is here today for evaluation.\n\nShe says she is better overall than before the surgery. She can walk better, the pain is not as bad, and the right leg pain is improved. The left leg pain is now in the L4‑L5 area and goes to the big toe and the space between the first two toes. She has no significant back pain, no right leg symptoms, no fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, wound drainage, or problems with the incision.\n\n**Findings**  \nMs. ABC looks well, is alert, and is not in distress. She has normal breathing and no fever. Muscle strength in her left leg is a bit weaker than before:  \n- Tibialis anterior (ankle lift) 3/5  \n- Extensor hallucis (big toe lift) 2/5  \n- Gastrocnemius‑soleus (calf) 3‑4/5  \nAll other muscle strengths are 4+/5. She has less sensation to light touch on the inside of her left foot. Straight‑leg‑raise test is normal on both sides. The incision is healed with no swelling or drainage.\n\nX‑ray today shows the screws at L4 and L5 are in the right place and have not moved. The MRI from 07/03/07 shows the back is properly decompressed. There is a moderate fluid collection under the skin, which is normal after a revision surgery and is not pressing on anything.\n\n**Assessment and plan**  \nMs. ABC is doing well after her L4‑L5 surgery. The only problem was a mis‑placed right L4 screw, which was corrected and the symptoms went away. The imaging shows the hardware is in the right place and there is only a normal fluid collection. No additional surgery is needed right now. I am also holding off on pain‑management injections because of the fluid collection to reduce infection risk.\n\nShe should keep moving and walking as much as possible. She can continue taking ReQuip for restless leg syndrome as her primary doctor suggested. I have referred her to Mrs. Khan in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for ongoing therapy. I will see her again in 3‑4 weeks to make sure she keeps improving. If she has any problems, she can come back sooner."
