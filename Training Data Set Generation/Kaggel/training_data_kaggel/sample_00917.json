ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and Marcaine 0.25% local. INDICATIONS: This 29-year-old female presents to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department on 08/30/2003 with history of acute abdominal pain. On evaluation, it was noted that the patient has clinical findings consistent with acute appendicitis. However, the patient with additional history of loose stools for several days prior to event. Therefore, a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained revealing findings consistent with acute appendicitis. There was no evidence of colitis on the CAT scan. With this in mind and the patient's continued pain at present, the patient was explained the risks and benefits of appendectomy. She agreed to procedure and informed consent was obtained. GROSS FINDINGS: The appendix was removed without difficulty with laparoscopic approach. The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it. There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was placed in supine position. After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision. Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg. The Veress needle was then removed. A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen. A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation. Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation. Photodocumentation was obtained. A 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant. This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix. Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization. Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix. Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix. Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples. Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure. Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it. The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site. The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated. The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic. Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear. There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site. This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty. There was no evidence of other areas of disease. Upon re-exploration with a video laparoscope in the abdomen and after this noting the appendix base to be hemostatic and intact. The instruments were removed from the patient and the port sites were then taken off under direct visualization. The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was released into the air and the fascia was approximated in the 10 mm and 12 mm port sites with #0 Vicryl ligature x2. Marcaine 0.25% was then utilized in all three incision sites and #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate the skin and all three incision sites. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and taken to Postoperative Care Unit in stable condition and monitored under General Medical Floor on IV antibiotics, pain medications, and return to diet.",

She also had loose stools for several days before the pain started. A CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis confirmed acute appendicitis and showed no colitis. Because her pain continued, the surgeon explained the risks and benefits of removing the appendix. She agreed and gave informed consent.  \n\nGROSS FINDINGS:  \nThe appendix was removed easily using a laparoscopic approach. It was visibly inflamed, but it had not burst.  \n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:  \nThe patient lay on her back. After anesthesia and cleaning, a curved #10 blade scalpel made a small incision below the belly button. A Veress needle was used to inflate the abdomen with CO₂ to 15 mmHg. The needle was removed, and a 10 mm trocar was inserted through the incision. A laparoscope was then inserted to view the abdomen. Bilateral ovarian cysts were seen, but they were not causing problems. A 5 mm port was placed in the right upper abdomen, and a blunt grasper moved the appendix. A 12 mm port was placed in the left lower abdomen next to the rectus muscle. Through this port, a small opening was made in the tissue that holds the appendix (mesoappendix). An EndoGIA stapler with GI staples cut the base of the appendix. The staples were then changed to vascular staples, and the mesoappendix was cut and its blood vessels tied off with vascular staples. Two 6 × loupes were used with the EndoGIA during this part. An EndoCatch was inserted through the 12 mm port, the appendix was placed inside it, and then removed through the same port. The 12 mm port was re‑inserted, CO₂ was re‑inflated, and the base of the appendix was checked for bleeding. Warm saline was aspirated and was clear. A small adhesion near the surgical site was gently cut away. No other disease was found. The laparoscope was used again to confirm the appendix base was sealed and intact. All instruments were removed, the port sites were closed under direct vision, and the CO₂ was released. The fascia (deep muscle layer) at the 10 mm and 12 mm sites was closed with two #0 Vicryl stitches. 0.25% Marcaine was injected into all three incision sites, and the skin was closed with #4‑0 Vicryl stitches. Steri‑Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the operation well, was taken to the Post‑operative Care Unit in stable condition, and was moved to the general medical floor for monitoring, IV antibiotics, pain medication, and a return to diet."
