  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Endoscopic carpal tunnel release. ANESTHESIA: I.V. sedation and local (1% Lidocaine). ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Zero. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated. The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg. Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray. A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin. Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery. A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned. Care was taken to protect the underlying contents. A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision. A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface. Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate. The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision. The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal. Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end. The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window. The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision. After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted. Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed. The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",

The arm was drained of blood and a tourniquet was set to 290 mm Hg. Lines were drawn on the left palm to find the correct spot. A small horizontal cut was made in the wrist, between the two forearm muscles, just above the line where the palm meets the forearm skin. The surgeon gently separated tissue to expose the outer layer of the forearm. Blood was stopped with a small electric cautery device. A small opening was made in this outer layer, taking care not to damage what was underneath. A larger cut was then made in the upper forearm to see the inside. A tool was used to feel the underside of the transverse carpal ligament and to lift the lining off it. The hook of the hamate bone was felt with a small hammer. The endoscopic tool was then put into the upper incision. The surgeon could see the transverse carpal ligament through the small opening. By pressing on the palm, the ligament was held against the opening while the tool was moved down the ligament to its far end. The far end of the ligament was found in the opening. The blade was lifted, the tool pulled out, and the ligament was cut under direct view. After the ligament was fully cut, the tool was put back in. The surgeon checked the edges of the ligament on both sides to make sure it was completely released. The wound was closed with a running stitch under the skin. Steri‑Strips were put on the skin and a sterile dressing was placed over them. The tourniquet was released. The patient woke up from anesthesia and was taken to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
