  "medical": "PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy and biopsy. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old female who has had a history of a nonspecific colitis, who was admitted 3 months ago at Hospital because of severe right-sided abdominal pains, was found to have multiple ulcers within the right colon, and was then readmitted approximately 2 weeks later because of a cecal volvulus, and had a right hemicolectomy. Since then, she has had persistent right abdominal pains, as well as diarrhea, with up to 2-4 bowel movements per day. She has had problems with recurrent seizures and has been seen by Dr. XYZ, who started her recently on methadone. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 200 mcg, Versed 10 mg, Phenergan 25 mg intravenously given throughout the procedure. INSTRUMENT: PCF-160L. PROCEDURE REPORT: Informed consent was obtained from the patient, after the risks and benefits of the procedure were carefully explained, which included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing polyps within the colon. A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the ileal colonic anastomosis, seen within the proximal transverse colon. The distal ileum was examined, which was normal in appearance. Random biopsies were obtained from the ileum and placed in jar #1. Random biopsies were obtained from the normal-appearing colon and placed in jar #2. Small internal hemorrhoids were noted within the rectum on retroflexion. COMPLICATIONS: None. ASSESSMENT: 1. Small internal hemorrhoids. 2. Ileal colonic anastomosis seen in the proximal transverse colon. 3. Otherwise normal colonoscopy and ileum examination. PLAN: Followup results of biopsies. If the biopsies are unremarkable, the patient may benefit from a trial of tricyclic antidepressants, if it's okay with Dr. XYZ, for treatment of her chronic abdominal pains.",
  "layman": "**Procedure Done:** Colonoscopy with biopsy.  \n\n**Why it was done:**  \nThe patient is a 50‑year‑old woman who has had a vague inflammation of the colon (colitis). Three months ago she was admitted to the hospital with severe pain on the right side of her belly. Doctors found several ulcers in her right colon and later she was readmitted about two weeks later because the cecum (the first part of the large intestine) twisted (cecal volvulus). She had a right hemicolectomy (removal of the right side of the colon). Since then she still has right‑side abdominal pain and diarrhea, with 2–4 bowel movements a day. She also has seizures and has recently been started on methadone by Dr. XYZ.  \n\n**Medications used during the procedure:**  \nFentanyl 200 mcg, Versed 10 mg, Phenergan 25 mg IV.  \n\n**Equipment:** PCF‑160L colonoscope.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient gave informed consent after the doctor explained the risks and benefits, including bleeding, infection, perforation, allergic reactions, and the chance that polyps could be missed. The colonoscope was inserted through the rectum and advanced to the ileal‑colonic anastomosis (the surgical connection between the ileum and colon) in the upper part of the transverse colon. The distal ileum looked normal. Random tissue samples were taken from the ileum (jar #1) and from the normal‑appearing colon (jar #2). Small internal hemorrhoids were seen in the rectum when the scope was turned back (retroflexion).  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n1. Small internal hemorrhoids.  \n2. Ileal‑colonic anastomosis in the upper transverse colon.  \n3. The rest of the colon and ileum appeared normal.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nWait for the biopsy results. If the biopsies are normal, the patient might try tricyclic antidepressants for her chronic abdominal pain, after checking with Dr. XYZ."
