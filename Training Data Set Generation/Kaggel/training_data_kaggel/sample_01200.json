  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Septic left total knee arthroplasty. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Septic left total knee arthroplasty. OPERATION PERFORMED: Arthroscopic irrigation and debridement of same with partial synovectomy. ANESTHESIA: LMA. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAINS: None. INDICATIONS: The patient is an 81-year-old female, who is approximately 10 years status post total knee replacement performed in another state, who presented a couple of days ago to the office with worsening pain without injury and whose symptoms have been present for approximately a month following a possible urinary tract infection. The patient' knee was aspirated in the office and cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. She presents for operative therapy. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: After obtaining informed consent and the administration of antibiotics since her cultures had already been obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and following satisfactory induction and the patient was placed on the table in supine position. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped without a tourniquet. The knee was injected with 30 mL of normal saline and standard arthroscopy portals were created. The arthroscopy was inserted and a complete diagnostic was performed. Arthroscopic pictures were taken throughout the procedure. The knee was copiously irrigated with 9 L of irrigant. A partial synovectomy was performed in all compartments. Minimal amount of polyethylene wear was noted. The total knee components were identified arthroscopically for future revision surgery. The knee was then drained and the arthroscopic instruments were removed. The portals were closed with 4-0 nylon and local anesthetic was injected. A sterile dressing was applied and the patient was placed in a knee immobilizer, awakened from anesthesia and transported to the recovery room in stable condition and tolerated the procedure well.",

She came to the office a few days ago with worsening knee pain that had been getting worse for about a month after a possible urinary tract infection. In the office, a fluid sample from her knee was taken and grew Escherichia coli. She was scheduled for surgery to treat the infection.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  \nAfter the patient gave informed consent and received antibiotics (her cultures were already known), she was taken to the operating room. She was put on her back (supine) and the left arm was cleaned and covered. No tourniquet was used. The knee was filled with 30 mL of normal saline and standard arthroscopy entry points were made. The arthroscope was inserted and a full diagnostic exam was done, with pictures taken. The knee was washed thoroughly with 9 L of irrigation fluid. A partial removal of the synovial lining was done in all areas of the knee. Only a small amount of wear on the polyethylene part of the knee was seen. The surgeon noted the positions of the knee components for future revision surgery. The knee was drained, the arthroscopy tools were removed, and the entry points were closed with 4‑0 nylon sutures. Local anesthetic was injected. A sterile dressing was applied and a knee brace was put on. The patient woke up from anesthesia, was moved to the recovery room in stable condition, and tolerated the procedure well."
