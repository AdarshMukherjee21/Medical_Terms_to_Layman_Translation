  "medical": "TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the skull base without contrast. FINDINGS: There is mild generalized atrophy. Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation are seen within the sub cortical and periventricular white matter compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation with no evidence of mass, hemorrhage, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The bony calvarium and skull base are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: No acute abnormalities.",
  "layman": "**Technique:** We took a series of CT scans from the top of the head down to the base of the skull, without using any contrast dye.\n\n**Findings:**  \n- The brain shows mild overall shrinkage.  \n- There are small, patchy areas of lower density in the outer brain layers and near the brain’s fluid spaces, which look like old, chronic changes from tiny blood vessel problems.  \n- The rest of the brain tissue looks normal, with no signs of a tumor, bleeding, shift of the brain’s center, enlarged fluid spaces, fluid outside the brain, or a recent stroke.  \n- The sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  \n- The skull bones and base are normal.\n\n**Impression:** No new or urgent problems were found."
