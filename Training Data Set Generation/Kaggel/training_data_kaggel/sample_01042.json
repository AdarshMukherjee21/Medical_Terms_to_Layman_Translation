  "medical": "CC: Progressive visual loss. HX: 76 y/o male suddenly became anosmic following shoulder surgery 13 years prior to this presentation. He continues to be anosmic, but has also recently noted decreased vision OD. He denies any headaches, weakness, numbness, weight loss, or nasal discharge. MEDS: none. PMH: 1) Diabetes Mellitus dx 1 year ago. 2) Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy, s/p TURP. 3) Right shoulder surgery (?DJD). FHX: noncontributory. SHX: Denies history of Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP132/66 HR78 RR16 36.0C MS: A&O to person, place, and time. No other specifics given in Neurosurgery/Otolaryngology/Neuro-ophthalmology notes. CN: Visual acuity has declined from 20/40 to 20/400, OD; 20/30, OS. No RAPD. EOM was full and smooth and without nystagmus. Goldmann visual fields revealed a central scotoma and enlarged blind spot OD and OS (OD worse) with a normal periphery. Intraocular pressures were 15/14 (OD/OS). There was moderate pallor of the disc, OD. Facial sensation was decreased on the right side (V1 distribution). Motor/Sensory/Coord/Station/Gait: were all unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout. Plantars were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: MRI Brain, 10/7/92, revealed: a large 6x5x6cm slightly heterogeneous, mostly isointense lesion on both T1 and T2 weighted images arising from the planum sphenoidale and olfactory groove. The mass extends approximately 3.6cm superior to the planum into both frontal regions with edema in both frontal lobes. The mass extends 2.5cm inferiorly involving the ethmoid sinuses with resultant obstruction of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses. It also extends into the superomedial aspect of the right maxillary sinus. There is probable partial encasement of both internal carotid arteries just above the siphon. The optic nerves are difficult to visualize but there is also probable encasement of these structures as well. The mass enhances significantly with gadolinium contrast. These finds are consistent with Meningioma. The patient underwent excision of this tumor by simultaneous bifrontal craniotomy and lateral rhinotomy following an intrasinus biopsy which confirmed the meningioma. Postoperatively, he lost visual acuity, OS, but this gradually returned to baseline. His 9/6/96 neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed visual acuity of 20/25-3 (OD) and 20/80-2 (OS). His visual fields continued to abnormal, but improved and stable when compared to 10/92. His anosmia never resolved.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Gradual loss of vision.  \n**History:** A 76‑year‑old man lost his sense of smell after shoulder surgery 13 years ago. He still cannot smell, but he has also noticed his right eye vision getting worse. He has no headaches, weakness, numbness, weight loss, or runny nose.  \n**Medications:** None.  \n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Diabetes diagnosed 1 year ago.  \n2. Enlarged prostate, treated with TURP.  \n3. Right shoulder surgery for possible arthritis.  \n**Family history:** Not relevant.  \n**Social history:** No tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.  \n\n**Exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 132/66, heart rate 78, breathing 16, temperature 36.0 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented.  \n- Vision: Right eye dropped from 20/40 to 20/400; left eye 20/30. No relative afferent pupillary defect.  \n- Eye movements normal, no nystagmus.  \n- Visual field test shows a central blind spot and enlarged blind spot in both eyes (worse in the right eye) but normal peripheral vision.  \n- Eye pressure normal (15/14).  \n- The optic disc in the right eye looks pale.  \n- Right side of face feels less sensitive (upper face).  \n- Motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and gait all normal.  \n- Reflexes normal, plantars flexor.  \n- Genital exam normal.  \n\n**Course:**  \nAn MRI on 10/7/1992 showed a large (6 × 5 × 6 cm) mass at the front of the skull, near the olfactory groove. It pushed into both frontal lobes, causing swelling, and extended into the ethmoid and frontal sinuses, blocking them. It also reached the upper part of the right maxillary sinus. The mass partly wrapped around both internal carotid arteries and likely the optic nerves. It brightened with contrast, consistent with a meningioma.  \n\nThe patient had surgery to remove the tumor via a front‑brain and nose approach. A biopsy confirmed it was a meningioma. After surgery, his left eye vision was lost but gradually returned to normal. A follow‑up eye exam on 9/6/1996 showed right eye vision 20/25 and left eye 20/80. Visual fields were still abnormal but had improved and stayed stable compared to the 1992 exam. His loss of smell did not improve."
