  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Sigmoidoscopy. INDICATIONS: Performed for evaluation of anemia, gastrointestinal Bleeding. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl (Sublazine) 0.1 mg IV Versed (midazolam) 1 mg IV BIOPSIES: No BRUSHINGS: PROCEDURE: A history and physical examination were performed. The procedure, indications, potential complications (bleeding, perforation, infection, adverse medication reaction), and alternative available were explained to the patient who appeared to understand and indicated this. Opportunity for questions was provided and informed consent obtained. After placing the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, the sigmoidoscope was inserted into the rectum and under direct visualization advanced to 25 cm. Careful inspection was made as the sigmoidoscope was withdrawn. The quality of the prep was good. The procedure was stopped due to patient discomfort. The patient otherwise tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. FINDINGS: Was unable to pass scope beyond 25 cm because of stricture vs very short bends secondary to multiple previous surgeries. Retroflexed examination of the rectum revealed small hemorrhoids. External hemorrhoids were found. Other than the findings noted above, the visualized colonic segments were normal. IMPRESSION: Internal hemorrhoids External hemorrhoids Unable to pass scope beyond 25 cm due either to stricture or very sharp bend secondary to multiple surgeries. Unsuccessful Sigmoidoscopy. Otherwise Normal Sigmoidoscopy to 25 cm. External hemorrhoids were found.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Sigmoidoscopy  \n**Reason for the test:** To look for causes of anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding.  \n\n**Medications given:**  \n- Fentanyl (Sublazine) 0.1 mg IV  \n- Versed (midazolam) 1 mg IV  \n\n**Biopsies:** None  \n**Brushings:** None  \n\n**What happened:**  \nThe doctor first took a history and did a physical exam. The doctor explained the procedure, possible risks (bleeding, perforation, infection, medication reaction), and other options. The patient understood and gave permission. The patient was turned onto their left side. The sigmoidoscope was gently inserted into the rectum and moved forward to 25 cm. While pulling it back, the doctor looked carefully. The bowel prep was good. The doctor stopped the test because the patient felt uncomfortable, but otherwise the patient tolerated it well and no complications occurred.  \n\n**Findings:**  \nThe scope could not go past 25 cm because of a narrowing or very sharp bend, likely from several previous surgeries. A backward look at the rectum showed small internal hemorrhoids and external hemorrhoids. The rest of the visible colon looked normal.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n- Internal and external hemorrhoids were found.  \n- The scope could not be advanced beyond 25 cm due to narrowing or a sharp bend from prior surgeries.  \n- The sigmoidoscopy was not completed, but the portion examined up to 25 cm was normal."
