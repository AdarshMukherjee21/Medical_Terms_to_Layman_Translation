  "medical": "CC: Headache (HA) HX: 10 y/o RHM awoke with a bilateral parieto-occipital HA associated with single episode of nausea and vomiting, 2 weeks prior to presentation. The nausea and vomiting resolved and did not recur. However, he continued to experience similar HA 3-4 times per week during the early morning upon awakening. He never felt the HA awakened him from sleep. The HA were partially relieved by Tylenol or Advil, and he distracted himself from the pain by remaining active. One week prior to presentation, he started to experience short episodes of blurred vision and diplopia. He also became fatigued, less active, and frequently yawned. He had no prior history of HA and he and his family denied any sign or symptom of focal weakness or numbness, dysphagia, dysarthria, or loss of consciousness. The patient underwent an MRI brain scan prior to transfer to UIHC. This revealed a mass in the left frontal region adjacent to the left temporal horn. The mass was an inhomogeneous blend of signals on T1 and T2 images giving a suggestion of acute bleeding, hemosiderin deposition and multiple vessels within the mass. MEDS: None. PMH: 1) He was a 7# 15oz. product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. His post-partum course was unremarkable. 2)Developmental milestones were reached at the appropriate times; though he was diagnosed with dyslexia 4 years ago. 3) No significant illnesses or hospitalizations. FHX: MGF (meningioma). PGF (lymphoma). Mother (migraine HA). Father and 22yr old brother are alive and well. SHX: lives with parents and attends mainstream 5th grade classes. EXAM: BP124/93 HR96 RR20 37.9C (tympanic) MS: A & O to person, place, time. Cooperative and interactive. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. CN: EOM intact. VFFTC, Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Fundoscopy: optic disks flat, no evidence of hemorrhage. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: full strength throughout all 4 extremities. Normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: unremarkable. Coord: unremarkable. Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2+ in RUE and RLE. 3 in LUE and LLE. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. HEENT: no meningismus. no cranial bruits. no skull defects palpated. GEN EXAM: unremarkable. COURSE: GS, PT/PTT, CBC were unremarkable. The MRI finding above lead to a differential diagnosis of Venous Angioma, Arteriovenous Malformation, Ependymoma, Neurocytoma, Glioma: all with associated hemorrhage. He underwent cerebral angiography on 1/25/93. Upon injection of the RCCA an avascular mass was identified in the right temporal lobe displacing the anterior choroidal artery, and temporal branches of the middle cerebral arteries. The internal cerebral vein is displaced to the left suggesting mass effect. There is a hypoplastic A1 segment and fetal origin of the LPCA. The mass was felt by neuroradiology to represent a hematoma. He underwent a right frontal craniotomy, 1/28/93. Pathological evaluation of the resected tissue was consistent with a vascular malformation with inclusive reactive glial tissue and evidence of recurrent and remote hemorrhage. There were dilated vascular channels having walls of variable thickness, but without evidence of elastic lamina by elastic staining. This was consistent with venous angioma/malformation.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Headache.  \n\n**History:** A 10‑year‑old boy woke up with a headache on both sides of the back of his head and had one episode of nausea and vomiting two weeks before he came in. The nausea and vomiting went away and did not happen again. He still had similar headaches 3–4 times a week in the early morning when he woke up. The headaches never woke him up from sleep. He could get some relief with Tylenol or Advil, and he tried to distract himself by staying active. A week before he came in, he began having brief episodes of blurry vision and double vision. He also felt more tired, was less active, and yawned a lot. He had never had a headache before, and he and his family said he had no weakness, numbness, trouble swallowing, trouble speaking, or fainting.\n\n**Imaging:** Before being sent to the university hospital, he had a brain MRI. It showed a mass in the left front part of his brain next to the left temporal horn. The mass had mixed signals on the images, suggesting recent bleeding, iron deposits, and many blood vessels inside it.\n\n**Medications:** None.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Born at full term, weighing 7 lb 15 oz, with an uncomplicated pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Recovery after birth was normal.  \n2. Reached developmental milestones on time, but was diagnosed with dyslexia four years ago.  \n3. No major illnesses or hospital visits.  \n\n**Family history:** Mother has migraines; a maternal grandfather had a meningioma; a paternal grandfather had lymphoma. His father and 22‑year‑old brother are healthy.\n\n**Social history:** Lives with parents and goes to regular 5th‑grade school.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 124/93, heart rate 96, breathing 20, temperature 37.9 °C (ear).  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cooperative and talks normally. Speech clear.  \n- Eye movements normal. Pupils equal (3 mm) and get smaller (2 mm) when light is shone. Eye exam shows normal optic discs with no bleeding.  \n- Rest of cranial nerve exam normal.  \n- Muscle strength normal in all four limbs. Muscle tone and size normal. Sensation normal. Coordination normal. No drift when holding arms out or standing with eyes closed. Walking normal. Reflexes 2+ in right arm and leg, 3+ in left arm and leg. Foot reflexes normal (flexor).  \n- Head, ears, nose, throat: no signs of meningitis, no abnormal sounds over the skull, and no skull defects. General exam: normal.\n\n**Course:** Blood tests (glucose, clotting times, complete blood count) were normal. The MRI led doctors to consider several possibilities: a venous angioma, an arteriovenous malformation, an ependymoma, a neurocytoma, or a glioma, all of which can bleed. He had a brain blood vessel study (angiography) on January 25, 1993. When dye was injected into the right carotid artery, they saw an avascular mass in the right temporal lobe that pushed the anterior choroidal artery and branches of the middle cerebral artery. The internal cerebral vein was pushed to the left, showing the mass was pressing on it. The A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery was small, and the left posterior cerebral artery had a fetal origin. The radiologists thought the mass was a hematoma (blood clot). He had a right frontal skull opening (craniotomy) on January 28, 1993. The tissue removed was examined and found to be a vascular malformation with surrounding reactive brain tissue and signs of recent and old bleeding. The vessels were wide and had walls of varying thickness, but no elastic layer was seen on special staining. This matched a venous angioma or malformation."
