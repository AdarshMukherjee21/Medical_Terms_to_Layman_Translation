  "medical": "INDICATION FOR STUDY: Chest pains, CAD, and cardiomyopathy. MEDICATIONS: Humulin, lisinopril, furosemide, spironolactone, omeprazole, carvedilol, pravastatin, aspirin, hydrocodone, and diazepam. BASELINE EKG: Sinus rhythm at 71 beats per minute, left anterior fascicular block, LVBB. PERSANTINE RESULTS: Heart rate increased from 70 to 72. Blood pressure decreased from 160/84 to 130/78. The patient felt slightly dizziness, but there was no chest pain or EKG changes. NUCLEAR PROTOCOL: Same day rest/stress protocol was utilized with 12 mCi for the rest dose and 33 mCi for the stress test. 53 mg of Persantine were used, reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline. NUCLEAR RESULTS: 1. Nuclear perfusion imaging, review of the raw projection data reveals adequate image acquisition. The resting images are normal. The post Persantine images show mildly decreased uptake in the septum. The sum score is 0. 2. The Gated SPECT shows enlarged heart with a preserved EF of 52%. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild septal ischemia. Likely due to the left bundle-branch block. 2. Mild cardiomyopathy, EF of 52%. 3. Mild hypertension at 160/84. 4. Left bundle-branch block.",
  "layman": "**Why the test was done:**  \nThe patient has chest pain, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a type of heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy).\n\n**Medications the patient is taking:**  \nHumulin, lisinopril, furosemide, spironolactone, omeprazole, carvedilol, pravastatin, aspirin, hydrocodone, and diazepam.\n\n**Initial heart test (EKG):**  \nNormal rhythm at 71 beats per minute, with a left anterior fascicular block and a left bundle‑branch block (LVBB).\n\n**Persantine (a drug used for the stress test) results:**  \nHeart rate rose from 70 to 72 beats per minute.  \nBlood pressure fell from 160/84 to 130/78.  \nThe patient felt a little dizzy but had no chest pain or changes on the EKG.\n\n**Nuclear stress test protocol:**  \nThe test was done the same day with a rest dose of 12 mCi and a stress dose of 33 mCi.  \n53 mg of Persantine was given and later reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline.\n\n**Nuclear test results:**  \n1. The images taken while resting look normal.  \n   After Persantine, the heart’s septum (the wall between the left and right sides) shows a small drop in blood flow.  \n   The overall score for the test is 0.  \n2. The gated SPECT scan shows the heart is a bit enlarged but still pumps well, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 52%.\n\n**Summary of findings:**  \n1. Mild reduced blood flow in the septum, probably related to the left bundle‑branch block.  \n2. Mild heart muscle disease, EF 52%.  \n3. Mild high blood pressure (160/84).  \n4. Presence of a left bundle‑branch block."
