Lysis of adhesions. 3. Right hemicolectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 200 cc. URINE OUTPUT: 200 cc. CRYSTALLOIDS GIVEN: 2700 cc. INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE: The patient is a 53-year-old African-American female who presented with near obstructing lesion at the hepatic flexure. The patient underwent a colonoscopy which found this lesion and biopsies were taken proving invasive adenocarcinoma. The patient was NG decompressed preoperatively and was prepared for surgery. The need for removal of the colon cancer was explained at length. The patient was agreeable to proceed with the surgery and signed preoperatively informed consent. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Operative Suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department and NG and Foley catheters were placed preoperatively. She was given triple antibiotics IV. Due to her near obstructive symptoms, a formal ________ was not performed. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline laparotomy incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel and subcutaneous tissues were separated with electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal fascia. Once divided, the intraabdominal cavity was accessed and bowel was protected as the rest of the abdominal wall was opened in the midline. Extensive fluid was seen upon entering the abdomen, ascites fluid, which was clear straw-colored and this was sampled for cytology. Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues. With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field. Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum. Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery. The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry. Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry. The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between. Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected. There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites. Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum. A third GIA-75 was fired side-by-side and GIA-55 was used to close the anastomosis. A patent anastomosis was palpated. The anastomosis was then protected with a #2-0 Vicryl #0-muscular suture. Next, the mesenteric root was closed with a running #0-Vicryl suture to prevent any chance of internal hernia. The suture sites were inspected and there was no evidence of leakage. Next, the intraabdominal cavity was thoroughly irrigated with sterile saline and the anastomosis was carried into the right lower gutter. Omentum was used to cover the intestines which appeared dilated and indurated from the near obstruction. Next, the abdominal wall was reapproximated and the fascial layer using a two running loop PDS sutures meeting in the middle with good approximation of both the abdominal fascia. Additional sterile saline was used to irrigate the subcutaneous fat and then the skin was closed with sequential sterile staples. Sterile dressing was applied and the skin was cleansed and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the Operating Room and she was transferred to Recovery Room in stable condition and will be continued to be monitored on the Telemetry Floor with triple antibiotics and NG decompression.",

Adhesions (scar tissue).  \n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED  \n1. Exploratory laparotomy (open the belly to look inside).  \n2. Lysis of adhesions (cut the scar tissue).  \n3. Right hemicolectomy (remove the right side of the colon).  \n\nANESTHESIA  \nGeneral (the patient was asleep and fully relaxed).  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS  \nNone.  \n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  \nLess than 200 cc.  \n\nURINE OUTPUT  \n200 cc.  \n\nCRYSTALLOIDS GIVEN  \n2700 cc of IV fluids.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE  \nThe patient is a 53‑year‑old African‑American woman who had a near‑obstructing growth at the bend of her colon. A colonoscopy found the growth and a biopsy confirmed invasive cancer. She was given a tube to drain her stomach (NG tube) before surgery and was prepared for the operation. The surgeon explained why the cancer needed to be removed. She agreed and signed the consent form.  \n\nPROCEDURE  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, laid on her back, and given general anesthesia. An NG tube and a urinary catheter were inserted before surgery. She received three different antibiotics through an IV. Because her symptoms were close to a blockage, a formal pre‑operative test was not done. The belly was cleaned and covered with sterile cloth. A straight cut was made across the middle of the belly with a surgical knife. The layers of tissue were separated with a cautery device until the belly wall was opened. The inside of the belly was opened and the intestines were protected while the rest of the belly wall was opened. A lot of clear, straw‑colored fluid (ascites) was seen and a sample was taken for testing. The small intestine was pulled aside and the surgeon looked for the cancer. The cancer was at the bend of the colon and was stuck to nearby tissue. The colon was moved along its natural line down to the right side, freeing the entire area from the ileocecal junction to the transverse colon. A small opening was made about 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a stapler (GIA‑75) was used to cut the ileum. Another stapler was used to cut the upper part of the transverse colon, sparing the middle colic artery. The surgeon then cut along the mesentery to the root, carefully removing several lymph nodes and placing small metal clips on the base of the mesentery. The blood vessels were tied off with #0‑Vicryl sutures. After the tissue was sent to pathology, the surgeon checked for bleeding. No bleeding was seen. A side‑by‑side connection (anastomosis) was made between the transverse colon and the end of the ileum. A third stapler (GIA‑75) was used and a GIA‑55 was used to close the connection. The connection was felt to be open. It was reinforced with a #2‑0 Vicryl muscle suture. The root of the mesentery was closed with a running #0‑Vicryl suture to prevent internal hernias. The suture lines were checked for leaks. The belly cavity was washed with sterile salt water and the new connection was moved into the lower right area. The omentum (fatty apron over the intestines) was used to cover the intestines, which were swollen and stiff from the near blockage. The belly wall was brought back together and the fascia (deep layer) was closed with two running PDS sutures that met in the middle, giving good closure. Extra sterile salt water was used to wash the subcutaneous fat and the skin was closed with staples. A sterile dressing was applied. The skin was cleaned. The patient woke up from anesthesia without problems, was taken off the breathing tube in the operating room, and was moved to the recovery room in stable condition. She will stay on the telemetry floor, receive the three antibiotics, and keep the NG tube for drainage."
