  "medical": "NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral ulnar sensory responses are absent. Bilateral median sensory distal latencies are prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude. The left radial sensory response is normal and robust. Left sural response is absent. Left median motor distal latency is prolonged with attenuated evoked response amplitude. Conduction velocity across the forearm is mildly slowed. Right median motor distal latency is prolonged with a normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity. The left ulnar motor distal latency is prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude both below and above the elbow. Conduction velocities across the forearm and across the elbow are prolonged. Conduction velocity proximal to the elbow is normal. The right median motor distal latency is normal with normal evoked response amplitudes at the wrist with a normal evoked response amplitude at the wrist. There is mild diminution of response around the elbow. Conduction velocity slows across the elbow. The left common peroneal motor distal latency evoked response amplitude is normal with slowed conduction velocity across the calf and across the fibula head. F-waves are prolonged. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the left arm and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles as well as middle thoracic muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, left abductor pollicis brevis, and first dorsal interosseous muscles. There were signs of chronic reinnervation in triceps, extensor digitorum communis, flexor pollicis longus as well first dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis muscles. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: 1. A sensory motor length-dependent neuropathy consistent with diabetes. 2. A severe left ulnar neuropathy. This is probably at the elbow, although definitive localization cannot be made. 3. Moderate-to-severe left median neuropathy. This is also probably at the carpal tunnel, although definitive localization cannot be made. 4. Right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, mild. 5. Right median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, moderate. 6. A left C8 radiculopathy (double crush syndrome). 7. There is no evidence for thoracic radiculitis. The patient has made very good response with respect to his abdominal pain since starting Neurontin. He still has mild allodynia and is waiting for authorization to get insurance coverage for his Lidoderm patch. He is still scheduled for MRI of C-spine and T-spine. I will see him in followup after the above scans.",
  "layman": "**Nerve Test Results**\n\nThe test looked at how nerves in both arms and legs send signals. Here’s what it found:\n\n- **Sensory nerves (those that feel touch):**  \n  - The ulnar nerves on both sides (which run along the inside of the elbow) did not send any signals.  \n  - The median nerves on both sides (which run along the thumb side of the arm) were slow and weak.  \n  - The left radial nerve (which runs on the thumb side of the forearm) worked normally.  \n  - The left sural nerve (a sensory nerve in the back of the leg) did not send any signals.  \n  - The left ulnar nerve’s signals were weak both above and below the elbow, and its speed was slow in the forearm and elbow.  \n  - The right median nerve’s signals were normal at the wrist but a little weaker around the elbow.  \n  - The left common peroneal nerve (a motor nerve that helps lift the foot) sent normal signals, but its speed was slow in the calf and near the fibula head.  \n  - The “F‑waves” (a test of nerve speed) were slower than normal.\n\n- **Motor nerves (those that move muscles):**  \n  - The left median nerve’s signals were slow and weak.  \n  - The right median nerve’s signals were normal at the wrist but slowed around the elbow.  \n  - The left ulnar nerve’s signals were weak and slow.  \n  - The left common peroneal nerve’s signals were normal but slow in the calf.\n\n**Needle EMG (muscle test)**\n\nA needle was used to test muscles in the left arm and back of the neck and upper back. Findings:\n\n- Some muscles in the neck and left hand (thumb and fingers) were showing spontaneous activity, indicating irritation.  \n- Other hand and arm muscles (triceps, finger extensors, finger flexors, and thumb muscles) showed signs of long‑term nerve damage and healing.\n\n**Overall Interpretation**\n\nThe electrical study is abnormal and shows:\n\n1. A length‑dependent nerve problem that is typical for diabetes.  \n2. A severe problem with the left ulnar nerve, probably near the elbow.  \n3. A moderate‑to‑severe problem with the left median nerve, probably at the wrist (carpal tunnel).  \n4. A mild problem with the right ulnar nerve at the elbow.  \n5. A moderate problem with the right median nerve at the wrist (carpal tunnel).  \n6. A left C8 nerve root issue (double‑crush syndrome).  \n7. No evidence of a problem in the middle back.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\n- The patient’s belly pain has improved a lot since starting Neurontin.  \n- He still has mild sensitivity to touch and is waiting for insurance approval for a Lidoderm patch.  \n- An MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine is still scheduled.  \n- The doctor will follow up after the scans."
