  "layman": "After the parents gave permission, the baby was put on the circumcision table. The area was cleaned three times with Betadine and then covered with sterile drapes. A small amount (0.2 mL) of 1% lidocaine was injected at the 10‑ and 2‑o’clock positions. Another 0.3 mL of lidocaine was used for a ring block. Glucose water was also used to help numb the area.  \n\nAfter a few minutes, a curved clamp was carefully placed at the 9‑o’clock position, making sure not to touch the opening of the urethra (meatus). A blunt probe was then inserted again, again avoiding the meatus. Once the initial skin folds were loosened, a straight clamp was used to break up more adhesions, taking care not to hit the frenulum. The clamps were then moved to the 12‑ and 6‑o’clock positions. A Mogen clamp was applied with a slight tilt toward the back. After holding the clamp for one minute, the foreskin was trimmed. One more minute later the clamp was removed and any remaining adhesions were cut.  \n\nThe baby tolerated the procedure well and only a little bleeding was seen. He was kept under observation for 20 minutes to make sure no more bleeding occurred. The family was given routine care instructions. Initially clean the area with plain water, and later use soap and water or diaper wipes once it has healed."
