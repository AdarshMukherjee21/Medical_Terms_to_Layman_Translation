  "medical": "PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) with rectal bleeding and pain on defecation. HISTORY: A 16-year-old African American male presents to the ED with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and pain on defecation. The patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating. The following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool. The pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge. The patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain. He also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and states that he was screened for HIV infection eight months ago and was negative. The patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week. He states that he had felt &quot;feverish&quot; on several occasions but has not taken his temperature. He has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue. He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss. The patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13. He admits to eight previous partners and states that he &quot;usually&quot; uses a condom. On further questioning, the patient states that of his eight partners, three were female and five were male. His most recent sexual partner was a 38-year-old man whom he has been with for the past six months. He states that he has been tested for STDs in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing. He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy. The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family. As the man was a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life. He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men. He is accessing care in the ED unaccompanied by an adult. PHYSICAL EXAM: Thin but non-toxic young man with clear discomfort. Pulse = 105 RR = 23 BP = 120/62 HEENT: Several areas of white plaque-like material on the buccal mucosa. Neck: Multiple anterior/posterior cervical nodes in both anterior and posterior chains- 1-2 cm in diameter. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Quiet precordium. Nl S1/S2 with a II/VI systolic murmur. Abdomen: Soft without hepatosplenomegaly. GU: Tanner V male with no external penile lesions. Lymph: 2-3 cm axillary nodes bilaterally. 1-2 cm epitrochlear nodes. Multiple 1-2 cm inguinal nodes. Rectal: Extremely painful digital exam. + gross blood and mucous. LABORATORY EVALUATION: Hbg = 12. 5 gm/dL Hct = 32% WBC = 3.9 thou/&micro;L Platelets = 120,000 thou/&micro;L 76% neutrophils 19% lymphocytes 1% eosinophils 4% monocytes ALT = 82 U/L AST= 90 U/L Erythrocyte sedimentation rate = 90 Electrolytes = normal Gram stain of anal swab: numerous WBCs DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: This patient is presenting with acute rectal pain with bleeding and anal discharge. The patient also presents with some constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination. The following are in the differential diagnosis: Acute Proctitis and Proctocolitis. ACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: This subject is sexually active and reports inconsistent condom use. Gastrointestinal symptoms have recently been reported commonly in patients with a history of HIV seroconversion. The rectal symptoms of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required. PERIRECTAL ABSCESS: A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD. The patient could experience more systemic symptoms with fever and malaise, as found with this patient. However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema. DIAGNOSIS: The subject had rectal cultures obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. An HIV ELISA was positive, as was the RNA PCR. DISCUSSION: This patient demonstrates a number of key issues to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult. First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care as opposed to identifying a primary care provider. Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when HIV counseling and testing were not performed. Second, this young man has had both male and female sexual partners. As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partners in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors. Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions. Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors. Although urine-based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections. If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs. Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms. As his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation. In addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered. The care provided to this young man included the following. He was treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis. Ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant N gonorrhoeae. At the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program. The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support. The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later. Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection. Set #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% Quantitative RNA PCR = 75,000 copies/mL Set #2 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 385 cells/mm3, 21% Quantitative RNA PCR = 12,000 copies/mL The risks and benefits of ART were discussed over three clinical visits. This patient agreed with not starting ART and following his CD4 and viral loads every three months.",
  "layman": "**Presentation**  \nA 16‑year‑old boy went to the emergency department (ED) because he was bleeding from his anus and felt pain when he had a bowel movement.\n\n**History**  \nThe boy said he had been fine until about three days ago when he first felt pain while going to the bathroom. The next day the pain got worse and he saw blood on the surface of his stool. The day after that the bleeding increased and he also noticed a pus‑like discharge from his anus. He has never had rectal bleeding or pain before, and he has never had a sexually transmitted disease (STD). He was tested for HIV eight months ago and the result was negative.  \n\nHe has felt unwell for the past week, describing feeling “feverish” several times but he did not check his temperature. He also has abdominal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, and fatigue. He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not weighed himself.  \n\nHe has been sexually active since age 13, has had eight partners (three women and five men), and usually uses a condom. His most recent partner is a 38‑year‑old man he has been with for six months. He has been tested for STDs in the past, but only gave urine and blood samples. He does not know his partner’s HIV status and assumes the partner is negative because he looks healthy.  \n\nHe also reports one episode of sexual abuse at age 8 by a family friend who was a church member. He never told anyone about it. He is worried about telling his family because they have made negative comments about men who have sex with men. He came to the ED alone, without an adult.\n\n**Physical Examination**  \nThe boy is thin but not visibly ill.  \n- Pulse 105 beats per minute, breathing 23 times per minute, blood pressure 120/62 mm Hg.  \n- Mouth: white plaque‑like patches on the inside of his cheeks.  \n- Neck: several swollen lymph nodes (1–2 cm) in the front and back of the neck.  \n- Lungs: clear.  \n- Heart: normal sounds with a mild 2/6 systolic murmur.  \n- Abdomen: soft, no enlarged liver or spleen.  \n- Genitals: fully developed male, no visible lesions.  \n- Lymph nodes: 2–3 cm in the armpits, 1–2 cm near the elbows, and several 1–2 cm nodes in the groin.  \n- Rectal exam: very painful, with visible blood and mucus.\n\n**Laboratory Results**  \n- Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL  \n- Hematocrit: 32 %  \n- White blood cells: 3.9 k/µL (neutrophils 76 %, lymphocytes 19 %, eosinophils 1 %, monocytes 4 %)  \n- Platelets: 120 k/µL  \n- Liver enzymes: ALT 82 U/L, AST 90 U/L  \n- Inflammation marker (ESR): 90 mm/h  \n- Electrolytes: normal  \n- Anal swab Gram stain: many white blood cells\n\n**Differential Diagnosis**  \nThe boy’s symptoms of rectal pain, bleeding, and discharge, along with fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, and swollen lymph nodes, suggest several possibilities:  \n1. Acute proctitis or proctocolitis (inflammation of the rectum and colon).  \n2. Acute HIV seroconversion (early HIV infection).  \n3. Perirectal abscess (a localized infection near the anus).  \n\n**Diagnosis**  \nRectal cultures grew *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (gonorrhea). HIV testing was positive by ELISA, and an HIV RNA PCR confirmed a viral load of 75,000 copies/mL.  \n\n**Discussion**  \nThis case highlights important points for caring for adolescents:  \n- The ED is a common place for young people to seek care, but routine HIV testing is essential when symptoms raise suspicion.  \n- Sexual history should be asked openly and without judgment; assuming heterosexuality can prevent disclosure.  \n- Urine‑based STD screening can miss infections of the throat or anus; additional swabs are needed if those activities occur.  \n- Because the boy had both local (rectal) and systemic (fever, swollen nodes) symptoms, HIV testing and a viral load test were appropriate.  \n\n**Treatment and Follow‑up**  \nHe was treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia with an intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline, chosen because of recent reports of drug‑resistant gonorrhea. A case manager from an adolescent HIV program met with him, provided counseling, and linked him to ongoing care.  \n\nFollow‑up labs:  \n- First visit: CD4 count 225 cells/mm³, viral load 75,000 copies/mL.  \n- Three months later: CD4 count 385 cells/mm³, viral load 12,000 copies/mL.  \n\nThe risks and benefits of starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) were discussed over three visits. The boy decided not to start ART at that time and agreed to have his CD4 count and viral load checked every three months."
