OPERATION PERFORMED: OssaTron extracorporeal shockwave therapy to right lateral epicondyle. ANESTHESIA: Bier block. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate Bier block anesthesia, the patient was positioned for extracorporeal shockwave therapy. The OssaTron equipment was brought into the field and the nose piece for treatment was placed against the lateral epicondyle targeting the area previously determined with the patient's input of maximum pain. Then using standard extracorporeal shockwave protocol, the OssaTron treatment was applied to the lateral epicondyle of the elbow. After completion of the treatment, the tourniquet was deflated, and the patient was returned to the holding area in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",

While the arm was numb, the patient was positioned for shockwave therapy. The OssaTron machine was set up, and the treatment tip was placed against the outside part of the elbow (the lateral epicondyle) where the patient felt the most pain. The machine then delivered the standard shockwave treatment to that spot. After the treatment finished, the tourniquet was released, and the patient was taken to the recovery area in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
