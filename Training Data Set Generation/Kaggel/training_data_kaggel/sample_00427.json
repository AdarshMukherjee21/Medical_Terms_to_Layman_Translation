  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Coronal hypospadias with chordee and asthma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Coronal hypospadias with chordee and asthma. PROCEDURE: Hypospadias repair (TIP) with tissue flap relocation and chordee release (Nesbit tuck). ANESTHETIC: General inhalational anesthetic with a caudal block. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloid. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL. TUBES/DRAINS: An 8-French Zaontz catheter. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 17-month-old boy with hypospadias abnormality. The plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in the supine position. The foreskin was retracted and cleansed. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed on the glans. The urethra was calibrated with the lacrimal duct probes to an 8-French. We then marked out the coronal cuff, the penile shaft skin as well as the glanular plate for future surgery with a marking pen. We then used a 15-blade knife to circumscribe the penis around the coronal cuff. We then degloved the penis using the curved tenotomy scissors, and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The patient had some splaying of the spongiosum tissue, which was also incised laterally and rotated to make a secondary flap. Once the penis was degloved, and the excessive chordee tissue was released, we then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline injected the penis for an artifical erection. He was still noted to have chordee, so a midline incision through the Buck fascia was made with a 15-blade knife and Heineke-Mikulicz closure using 5-0 Prolene was then used for the chordee Nesbit tuck. We repeated the artificial erection and the penis was straight. We then incised the urethral plate with an ophthalmic blade in the midline, and then elevated the glanular wings using a 15-blade knife to elevate and then incise them. Using the curved iris scissors, we then also further mobilized the glanular wings. The 8-French Zaontz was then placed while the tourniquet was still in place into the urethral plate. The upper aspect of the distal meatus was then closed with an interrupted suture of 7-0 Vicryl, and then using a running subcuticular closure, we closed the urethral plates over the Zaontz catheter. We then mobilized subcutaneous tissue from the penile shaft skin, and the inner perpetual skin on the dorsum, and then buttonholed the flap, placed it over the head of the penis, and then, used it to cover of the hypospadias repair with tacking sutures of 7-0 Vicryl. We then rolled the spongiosum flap to cover the distal urethra that was also somewhat dysplastic; 7-0 Vicryl was used for that as well. 5-0 Vicryl was used to roll the glans with 2 deep sutures, and then, horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to reconstitute the glans. Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to approximate the urethral meatus to the glans. Once this was done, we then excised the excessive penile shaft skin, and used the interrupted sutures of 6-0 chromic to attach the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff. On the ventrum itself, we used horizontal mattress sutures to close the defect. At the end of the procedure, the Zaontz catheter was sutured into place with a 4-0 Prolene suture, Dermabond tissue adhesive, and Surgicel was used as a dressing and a second layer of Telfa and clear eye tape was then used to tape it into place. IV Toradol was given at the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",

The surgical team checked the consent, the surgical site, and the patient’s identity. After anesthesia and a caudal block, the team gave IV antibiotics. The boy was laid on his back. The foreskin was pulled back and cleaned. The area was sterilized and draped.\n\nA 4‑0 Prolene stitch was placed on the glans (the tip of the penis). The urethra was measured with lacrimal duct probes to an 8‑French size. The surgeon marked the coronal cuff, the skin of the penile shaft, and the glanular plate with a pen for future steps. A 15‑blade knife was used to cut around the coronal cuff. The penis was then degloved (the skin was removed) with curved tenotomy scissors, and electrocautery stopped bleeding. The spongiosum tissue (the erectile tissue) was split and rotated to create a secondary flap.\n\nAfter degloving and releasing the chordee tissue, a vessel‑loop tourniquet was placed around the base of the penis. Saline was injected into the penis to create an artificial erection. The penis still had a bend, so a midline cut was made through the Buck’s fascia with a 15‑blade knife. A Heineke‑Mikulicz closure (a specific stitch technique) with 5‑0 Prolene was used to perform the Nesbit tuck. The artificial erection was repeated and the penis was straight.\n\nThe urethral plate was cut in the middle with an ophthalmic blade, and the glanular wings were lifted and cut with a 15‑blade knife. Curved iris scissors further mobilized the glanular wings. The 8‑French Zaontz catheter was inserted into the urethral plate while the tourniquet was still on. The upper part of the distal meatus (the opening) was closed with an interrupted 7‑0 Vicryl stitch, and a running subcuticular stitch closed the urethral plates over the catheter.\n\nSubcutaneous tissue was lifted from the penile shaft skin and the inner dorsal skin. A flap was buttonholed (a small opening was made) and placed over the head of the penis, then used to cover the hypospadias repair with 7‑0 Vicryl tacking stitches. A spongiosum flap was rolled to cover the distal urethra, also using 7‑0 Vicryl. The glans was rolled with 5‑0 Vicryl using two deep stitches, and horizontal mattress stitches of 7‑0 Vicryl re‑formed the glans. Interrupted 7‑0 Vicryl stitches approximated the urethral meatus to the glans.\n\nExcess penile shaft skin was removed, and interrupted 6‑0 chromic stitches attached the remaining skin to the coronal cuff. On the ventral side, horizontal mattress stitches closed the defect.\n\nAt the end, the Zaontz catheter was secured with a 4‑0 Prolene stitch, Dermabond tissue adhesive, and Surgicel dressing. A second layer of Telfa and clear eye tape was applied. IV Toradol (a pain reliever) was given during the procedure. The boy tolerated the surgery well and was stable when transferred to recovery."
