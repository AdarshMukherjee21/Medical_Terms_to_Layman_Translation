  "medical": "EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: Abdominal pain. COMPARISON EXAM: None. TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained. 5-mm slices were acquired after injection of 125 cc of Omnipaque IV. In addition, oral ReadiCAT was given. Reformatted sagittal and coronal images were obtained. DISCUSSION: There are numerous subcentimeter nodules seen within the lung bases. The largest measures up to 6 mm. No hiatal hernia is identified. Consider chest CT for further evaluation of the pulmonary nodules. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits. No dilated loops of bowel. There are punctate foci of air seen within the nondependent portions of the peritoneal cavity as well as the anterior subcutaneous fat. In addition, there is soft tissue stranding seen of the lower pelvis. In addition, the uterus is not identified. Correlate with history of recent surgery. There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy seen within the abdomen or pelvis. The bladder is within normal limits for technique. No acute bony abnormalities appreciated. No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. Postoperative changes seen within the pelvis without appreciable evidence for free fluid. 2. Numerous subcentimeter nodules seen within the lung bases. Consider chest CT for further characterization.",
  "layman": "EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.  \nREASON FOR EXAM: Abdominal pain.  \nCOMPARISON EXAM: None.  \n\nTECHNIQUE: We took many cross‑sectional pictures of the abdomen and pelvis. 5‑mm slices were made after giving 125 cc of Omnipaque through an IV. Oral ReadiCAT was also taken. We also made side‑view and front‑view images.  \n\nDISCUSSION: Small spots (less than 1 cm) are seen in the lower parts of the lungs, the biggest being 6 mm. No hiatal hernia is seen. A chest CT might help look at these lung spots more closely. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys look normal. The intestines are not stretched out. Tiny air spots are seen in the upper part of the belly cavity and under the skin at the front. There is some soft‑tissue swelling in the lower pelvis. The uterus is not visible; this may be related to recent surgery. No free fluid or swollen lymph nodes are seen in the abdomen or pelvis. The bladder looks normal. No bone problems are seen, and there are no suspicious bone growths.  \n\nIMPRESSION: 1. After surgery, there are changes in the pelvis but no free fluid. 2. Many small spots in the lower lungs; a chest CT could help examine them further."
