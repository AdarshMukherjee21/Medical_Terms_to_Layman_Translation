  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female complaining of elbow pain. FINDINGS: There is severe tendinitis of the common extensor tendon origin with diffuse intratendinous inflammation (coronal T2 image #1452, sagittal T2 image #1672). There is irregularity of the deep surface of the tendon consistent with mild fraying (#1422 and 1484) however there is no distinct tear. There is a joint effusion of the radiocapitellar articulation with mild fluid distention. The radial collateral (proper) ligament remains intact. There is periligamentous inflammation of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (coronal T2 image #1484) of the radial collateral ligamentous complex. There is no articular erosion or osteochondral defect with no intra-articular loose body. There is minimal inflammation of the subcutis adipose space extending along the origin of the common flexor tendon (axial T2 image #1324). The common flexor tendon otherwise is normal. There is minimal periligamentous inflammation of the anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament (coronal T2 image #1516, axial T2 image #1452) with an intrinsically normal ligament. The ulnotrochlear articulation is normal. The brachialis and biceps tendons are normal with a normal triceps tendon. The anterior, posterior, medial and lateral muscular compartments are normal. The radial, median and ulnar nerves are normal with no apparent ulnar neuritis. IMPRESSION: Lateral epicondylitis with severe tendinitis of the common extensor tendon origin and minimal deep surface fraying, without a discrete tendon tear. Periligamentous inflammation of the radial collateral ligamentous complex as described above with intrinsically normal ligaments. Small joint effusion of the radiocapitellar articulation with no osteochondral defect or intra-articular loose body. Mild peritendinous inflammation of the subcutis adipose space adjacent to the common flexor tendon origin with an intrinsically normal tendon. Minimal periligamentous inflammation of the anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament with an intrinsically normal ligament.",
  "layman": "A middle‑aged woman reports pain in her elbow.  \n\n**Findings**  \n- The tendon that starts the common extensor muscle is badly inflamed (tendinitis). The tendon’s inside shows widespread inflammation on the MRI images. The outer edge of the tendon looks a little frayed, but there is no clear tear.  \n- There is a small amount of fluid in the joint where the radius meets the capitellum (radiocapitellar joint).  \n- The radial collateral ligament is intact, but the tissue around it is inflamed.  \n- The joint surface is smooth; there are no bone chips or loose pieces inside the joint.  \n- A little inflammation is seen in the fatty tissue under the skin near the start of the common flexor tendon. The common flexor tendon itself is normal.  \n- The front part of the ulnar collateral ligament shows mild surrounding inflammation, but the ligament itself is normal.  \n- The ulnotrochlear joint (elbow joint) is normal.  \n- The brachialis, biceps, and triceps tendons are all normal.  \n- All muscle groups in the arm are normal.  \n- The radial, median, and ulnar nerves are normal; there is no sign of ulnar nerve inflammation.  \n\n**Impression**  \n- Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) with severe inflammation of the common extensor tendon’s origin and slight fraying of its outer edge, but no tear.  \n- Inflammation around the radial collateral ligament complex, though the ligaments themselves are normal.  \n- Small fluid collection in the radiocapitellar joint, with no bone damage or loose fragments.  \n- Mild inflammation of the fatty tissue under the skin near the common flexor tendon origin, with the tendon itself normal.  \n- Minor inflammation around the front part of the ulnar collateral ligament, with the ligament normal."
