  "medical": "CC: Headache (HA) HX: 10 y/o RHM awoke with a bilateral parieto-occipital HA associated with single episode of nausea and vomiting, 2 weeks prior to presentation. The nausea and vomiting resolved and did not recur. However, he continued to experience similar HA 3-4 times per week during the early morning upon awakening. He never felt the HA awakened him from sleep. The HA were partially relieved by Tylenol or Advil, and he distracted himself from the pain by remaining active. One week prior to presentation, he started to experience short episodes of blurred vision and diplopia. He also became fatigued, less active, and frequently yawned. He had no prior history of HA and he and his family denied any sign or symptom of focal weakness or numbness, dysphagia, dysarthria, or loss of consciousness. The patient underwent an MRI brain scan prior to transfer to UIHC. This revealed a mass in the left frontal region adjacent to the left temporal horn. The mass was an inhomogeneous blend of signals on T1 and T2 images giving a suggestion of acute bleeding, hemosiderin deposition and multiple vessels within the mass. MEDS: None. PMH: 1) He was a 7# 15oz. product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. His post-partum course was unremarkable. 2)Developmental milestones were reached at the appropriate times; though he was diagnosed with dyslexia 4 years ago. 3) No significant illnesses or hospitalizations. FHX: MGF (meningioma). PGF (lymphoma). Mother (migraine HA). Father and 22yr old brother are alive and well. SHX: lives with parents and attends mainstream 5th grade classes. EXAM: BP124/93 HR96 RR20 37.9C (tympanic) MS: A & O to person, place, time. Cooperative and interactive. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. CN: EOM intact. VFFTC, Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Fundoscopy: optic disks flat, no evidence of hemorrhage. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: full strength throughout all 4 extremities. Normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: unremarkable. Coord: unremarkable. Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2+ in RUE and RLE. 3 in LUE and LLE. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. HEENT: no meningismus. no cranial bruits. no skull defects palpated. GEN EXAM: unremarkable. COURSE: GS, PT/PTT, CBC were unremarkable. The MRI finding above lead to a differential diagnosis of Venous Angioma, Arteriovenous Malformation, Ependymoma, Neurocytoma, Glioma: all with associated hemorrhage. He underwent cerebral angiography on 1/25/93. Upon injection of the RCCA an avascular mass was identified in the right temporal lobe displacing the anterior choroidal artery, and temporal branches of the middle cerebral arteries. The internal cerebral vein is displaced to the left suggesting mass effect. There is a hypoplastic A1 segment and fetal origin of the LPCA. The mass was felt by neuroradiology to represent a hematoma. He underwent a right frontal craniotomy, 1/28/93. Pathological evaluation of the resected tissue was consistent with a vascular malformation with inclusive reactive glial tissue and evidence of recurrent and remote hemorrhage. There were dilated vascular channels having walls of variable thickness, but without evidence of elastic lamina by elastic staining. This was consistent with venous angioma/malformation.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint**  \nHeadache.\n\n**History**  \nA 10‑year‑old boy woke up with a headache that felt on both sides of his head near the back of his skull. He also had one episode of nausea and vomiting two weeks before he came to the doctor. The nausea and vomiting stopped and did not come back. The headache, however, kept happening 3–4 times a week in the early morning when he woke up. The headache never woke him from sleep. He could get some relief with Tylenol or Advil, and staying active helped him distract from the pain.  \n\nA week before he came in, he started having brief episodes of blurry vision and double vision. He also felt more tired, was less active, and yawned a lot. He had never had a headache before. He and his family said they had not noticed any weakness, numbness, trouble swallowing, trouble speaking, or fainting.  \n\nHe had an MRI of the brain before being transferred to the university hospital. The scan showed a mass in the left front part of his brain near the left temporal horn. The mass looked mixed on T1 and T2 images, suggesting it might have had recent bleeding, iron deposits (hemosiderin), and many blood vessels inside it.  \n\n**Medical and Family History**  \n- Born at full term, 7‑pound, 15‑ounce baby, normal delivery, no problems after birth.  \n- Met developmental milestones on time; diagnosed with dyslexia four years ago.  \n- No major illnesses or hospital stays.  \n- Family: Mother has migraines; father and 22‑year‑old brother are healthy.  \n\n**Social History**  \nLives with parents, attends regular 5th‑grade classes.  \n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- Blood pressure 124/93, heart rate 96, breathing 20, body temperature 37.9 °C (ear).  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, time.  \n- Cooperative, talks normally.  \n- Speech clear, no slurred words.  \n- Eye movements normal.  \n- Pupils equal (3/3) and get smaller (2/2) when light shines.  \n- Eye exam shows normal optic discs, no bleeding.  \n- No other eye or facial nerve problems.  \n- Muscles strong in all four limbs, normal tone and size.  \n- Sensation normal.  \n- Coordination normal.  \n- No arm drift or balance problems.  \n- Walking normal.  \n- Reflexes normal in arms and legs.  \n- Plantar reflexes (foot) flexing normally.  \n- Head, ears, nose, throat normal.  \n- No neck stiffness, no skull defects.  \n- General exam normal.  \n\n**Laboratory Tests**  \nBlood clotting tests (PT, PTT), complete blood count (CBC) all normal.  \n\n**Imaging and Diagnosis**  \nThe MRI suggested possibilities: venous angioma, arteriovenous malformation, ependymoma, neurocytoma, or glioma, all of which can bleed.  \n\nA cerebral angiogram was done on January 25, 1993. When dye was injected into the right carotid artery, an avascular (no blood flow) mass was seen in the right temporal lobe pushing the anterior choroidal artery and branches of the middle cerebral artery. The internal cerebral vein was pushed to the left, showing the mass was pressing on it. The A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery was small, and the posterior communicating artery had a fetal origin. The radiologists thought the mass was a hematoma (blood collection).  \n\nHe had a right frontal craniotomy (surgery to remove part of the skull) on January 28, 1993. Pathology of the removed tissue showed a vascular malformation with reactive glial tissue and signs of both recent and old bleeding. The vessels were dilated, had walls of varying thickness, but no elastic layer on special staining. This matched a venous angioma or malformation."
