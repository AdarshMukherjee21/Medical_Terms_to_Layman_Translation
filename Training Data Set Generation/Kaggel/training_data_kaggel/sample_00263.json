  "medical": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting to our clinic for the first time for evaluation of hip pain, right greater than left, of greater than 2 years duration. The patient states that she began with right hip pain getting steadily worse over the last 2 years and has now developed some pain in the left hip. The pain is located laterally as well as anteriorly into the groin. She states that the pain is present during activities such as walking, and she does get some painful popping and clicking in the right hip. She is here for evaluation for the first time. She sought no previous medical attention for this. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for depression and reflux disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cesarean section x 2. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Listed in the chart and reviewed with the patient. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. She is employed as an office manager. She does smoke cigarettes, one pack per day for the last 20 years. She consumes alcohol 3 to 5 drinks daily. She uses no illicit drugs. She exercises monthly mainly walking and low impact aerobics. She also likes to play softball. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant for occasional indigestion and nausea as well as anxiety and depression. The remainder of the systems negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is 5 foot, 2 inches tall, weighs 155 pounds. The patient ambulates independently without an assist device with normal stance and gait. Inspection of the hips reveals normal contour and appearance and good symmetry. The patient is able to do an active straight leg raise against gravity and against resistance bilaterally. She has no significant trochanteric tenderness. She does, however, have some tenderness in the groin bilaterally. There is no crepitus present with passive or active range of motion of the hips. She is grossly neurologically intact in the bilateral lower extremities. DIAGNOSTIC DATA: X-rays performed today in the clinic include an AP view of the pelvis and a frog-leg lateral of the right hip. There are no acute findings. No fractures or dislocations. There are minimal degenerative changes noted in the joint. There is, however, the suggestion of an exostosis on the superior femoral neck, which could be consistent with femoroacetabular impingement. IMPRESSION: Bilateral hip pain, right worse than left, possibly suggesting femoroacetabular impingement based on x-rays and her clinical picture is also consistent with possible labral tear. PLAN: After discussing possible diagnoses with the patient, I have recommended that we get MRI arthrograms of the bilateral hips to evaluate the anatomy and especially concentrating on the labrum in the right hip. We will get that done as soon as possible. In the meantime, she is asked to moderate her activities. She will follow up as soon as the MRIs are performed.",
  "layman": "**History of Present Illness**  \nA 38‑year‑old woman came to our clinic for the first time because she has had hip pain for more than two years. The pain started in her right hip and has gotten worse over time. She now also feels pain in her left hip. The pain is on the outside and front of the hips, reaching into the groin. It hurts when she walks and she sometimes hears popping or clicking in her right hip. She has not seen a doctor about this before.\n\n**Past Medical History**  \n- Depression  \n- Acid reflux\n\n**Past Surgical History**  \n- Two C‑sections\n\n**Current Medications**  \nListed in the chart and reviewed with her.\n\n**Allergies**  \nNo known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History**  \n- Married, works as an office manager  \n- Smokes one pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years  \n- Drinks 3–5 alcoholic drinks daily  \n- No illegal drug use  \n- Exercises once a month, mainly walking and low‑impact aerobics; also plays softball\n\n**Review of Systems**  \n- Occasional indigestion, nausea, anxiety, and depression  \n- All other systems normal\n\n**Physical Examination**  \n- Height: 5′2″, Weight: 155 lb  \n- Walks without a cane, normal stance and gait  \n- Hips look normal and symmetrical  \n- Can lift legs straight up against gravity and resistance on both sides  \n- No tenderness over the outer hip bone (trochanter)  \n- Tenderness in the groin on both sides  \n- No grinding or crackling when moving hips  \n- Lower limbs feel normal on neurological exam\n\n**Diagnostic Data**  \nX‑rays of the pelvis and right hip show no fractures or dislocations. There are only mild wear changes in the joint. An extra bony growth on the upper part of the femur (femoral neck) may indicate femoroacetabular impingement.\n\n**Impression**  \nBoth hips hurt, especially the right. The X‑rays and how she feels suggest femoroacetabular impingement and possibly a labral tear.\n\n**Plan**  \nWe discussed the possible conditions with her. We will order MRI arthrograms of both hips to look closely at the labrum, especially on the right side. The MRIs will be done soon. In the meantime, she should reduce her activity level. She will return for follow‑up once the MRIs are finished."
