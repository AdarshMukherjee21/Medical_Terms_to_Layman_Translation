Severe heterogeneous plaque seen in external carotid artery with degree of stenosis around 70%. 4. Peak systolic velocity is normal in common carotid, bulb, and internal carotid artery. 5. Peak systolic velocity is 280 cm/sec in external carotid artery with moderate spectral broadening. LEFT: 1. Mild heterogeneous plaque seen in common carotid artery and external carotid artery. 2. Moderate heterogeneous plaque seen in the bulb and internal carotid artery with degree of stenosis less than 50%. 3. Peak systolic velocity is normal in common carotid artery and in the bulb. 4. Peak systolic velocity is 128 cm/sec in internal carotid artery and 156 cm/sec in external carotid artery. VERTEBRALS: Antegrade flow seen bilaterally.",
  "layman": "RIGHT SIDE:  \n1. A small, uneven plaque is present in the common carotid artery.  \n2. A moderate, uneven plaque is in the carotid bulb and the internal carotid artery.  \n3. A large, uneven plaque is in the external carotid artery, narrowing the artery by about 70%.  \n4. The speed of blood during heart contraction (peak systolic velocity) is normal in the common carotid, bulb, and internal carotid arteries.  \n5. The peak systolic velocity is 280 cm/sec in the external carotid artery, with a moderate spread of speeds.  \n\nLEFT SIDE:  \n1.
