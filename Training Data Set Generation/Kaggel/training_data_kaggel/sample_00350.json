  "medical": "CC: Sudden onset blindness. HX: This 58 y/o RHF was in her usual healthy state, until 4:00PM, 1/8/93, when she suddenly became blind. Tongue numbness and slurred speech occurred simultaneously with the loss of vision. The vision transiently improved to &quot;severe blurring&quot; enroute to a local ER, but worsened again once there. While being evaluated she became unresponsive, even to deep noxious stimuli. She was transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. Upon arrival at UIHC her signs and symptoms were present but markedly improved. PMH: 1) Hysterectomy many years previous. 2) Herniorrhaphy in past. 3) DJD, relieved with NSAIDs. FHX/SHX: Married x 27yrs. Husband denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use for her. Unremarkable FHx. MEDS: none. EXAM: Vitals: 36.9C. HR 93. BP 151/93. RR 22. 98% O2Sat. MS: somnolent, but arousable to verbal stimulation. minimal speech. followed simple commands on occasion. CN: Blinked to threat from all directions. EOM appeared full, Pupils 2/2 decreasing to 1/1. +/+Corneas. Winced to PP in all areas of Face. +/+Gag. Tongue midline. Oculocephalic reflex intact. Motor: UE 4/5 proximally. Full strength in all other areas. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: Withdrew to PP in all extremities. Gait: ND. Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout UE, 3/3 patella, 2/2 ankles, Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: MRI Brain revealed bilateral thalamic strokes. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an intraatrial septal aneurysm with right to left shunt. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed the same. No intracardiac thrombus was found. Lower extremity dopplers were unremarkable. Carotid duplex revealed 0-15% bilateral ICA stenosis. Neuroophthalmologic evaluation revealed evidence of a supranuclear vertical gaze palsy OU (diminished up and down gaze). Neuropsychologic assessment 1/12-15/93 revealed severe impairment of anterograde verbal and visual memory, including acquisition and delayed recall and recognition. Speech was effortful and hypophonic with very defective verbal associative fluency. Reading comprehension was somewhat preserved, though she complained that despite the ability to see type clearly, she could not make sense of words. There was impairment of 2-D constructional praxis. A follow-up Neuropsychology evaluation in 7/93 revealed little improvement. Laboratory studies, TSH, FT4, CRP, ESR, GS, PT/PTT were unremarkable. Total serum cholesterol 195, Triglycerides 57, HDL 43, LDL 141. She was placed on ASA and discharged1/19/93. She was last seen on 5/2/95 and was speaking fluently and lucidly. She continued to have mild decreased vertical eye movements. Coordination and strength testing were fairly unremarkable. She continues to take ASA 325 mg qd.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: sudden blindness.  \nHistory: A 58‑year‑old woman was healthy until 4:00 p.m. on January 8, 1993, when she suddenly lost her vision. She also felt numbness in her tongue and had slurred speech at the same time. Her vision got a little better to severe blurring while she was on the way to a local emergency room, but it got worse again when she arrived. While being examined she became unresponsive, even to painful stimuli. She was moved to UIHC for more tests. When she got there, her symptoms were still there but had improved a lot.  \n\nPast medical history: 1) She had a hysterectomy many years ago. 2) She had hernia repair surgery before. 3) She has osteoarthritis, which she manages with NSAIDs.  \nFamily and social history: She has been married for 27 years. Her husband says she does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. Family history is normal.  \nMedications: none.  \n\nPhysical exam: Vital signs were 36.9 °C, heart rate 93, blood pressure 151/93, breathing 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98%.  \nMental status: she was drowsy but could be awakened by talking. She spoke very little and could follow simple instructions sometimes.  \nCranial nerves: she blinked when something threatened her eyes from any direction. Eye movements were normal, pupils were 2 mm and became 1 mm. Corneas were clear. She winced when pressure was applied to any part of her face. She could gag. Her tongue was straight in the middle. The oculocephalic reflex (head‑turn test) was normal.  \nMotor: her upper arms had 4/5 strength near the shoulder; all other muscles had full strength. Muscle tone and size were normal.  \nSensory: she withdrew when pressure was applied to all limbs.  \nGait: not tested.  \nReflexes: normal in the arms, knees, and ankles; toes flexed when pressed.  \nGeneral exam: normal.  \n\nCourse: An MRI of her brain showed strokes in both thalamus areas. A heart ultrasound (transthoracic) found an aneurysm in the wall between the heart’s upper chambers that allowed blood to flow from right to left. A second heart ultrasound (transesophageal) confirmed this. No blood clots were found in the heart. Leg blood tests were normal. A carotid scan showed only mild narrowing (0–15%) of both internal carotid arteries. Eye specialist testing found a problem with looking up and down in both eyes. A neuropsychology test done from January 12–15, 1993 showed severe trouble remembering new verbal and visual information, including learning new things and recalling them later. Her speech was slow, soft, and she had trouble forming words. She could read and understand some words, but said she could not make sense of what she saw. She also had difficulty drawing simple two‑dimensional shapes. A follow‑up neuropsychology test in July 1993 showed little improvement. Blood tests for thyroid, inflammation, clotting, and other routine labs were normal. Her cholesterol was 195 mg/dL, triglycerides 57 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, LDL 141 mg/dL. She was started on aspirin and discharged on January 19, 1993. She was last seen on May 2, 1995, speaking fluently and clear. She still had mild difficulty moving her eyes up and down. Coordination and strength were mostly normal. She still takes 325 mg aspirin daily."
