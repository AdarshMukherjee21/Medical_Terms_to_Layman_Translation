  "medical": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: Back pain and right leg pain. The patient has a three-year history of small cell lung cancer with metastases. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is on my schedule today to explore treatment of the above complaints. She has a two-year history of small cell lung cancer, which she says has spread to metastasis in both femurs, her lower lumbar spine, and her pelvis. She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count. She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief. She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms. Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee. She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times. She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain. She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature. She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking. She is on significant doses of narcotics. She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for cancer as above. She also has a depression. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a chest port placement. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet. She does not know of what strength up to eight daily. She also is on warfarin 1 mg daily, which she states is just to keep her chest port patent. She is on Neurontin 300 mg three times daily. HABITS: She smokes one pack a day for last 30 years. She drinks beer approximately twice daily. She denies use of recreational drugs. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married. She lives with her spouse. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for two brothers and father who have cancer. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant mainly for her pain complaints. For other review of systems the patient seems stable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Reveals a pleasant somewhat emaciated Caucasian female. Vital Signs: Height is 5 feet 2 inches. Weight is 130 pounds. She is afebrile. HEENT: Benign. Neck: Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: Soft, regular bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal: Examination shows functional range of joint movements. No focal muscle weakness. She is deconditioned. Neurologic: She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect. The patient has normal tone and coordination. Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles. Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick. Spine: Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement. The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints. FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it. INVESTIGATION: She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally. She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally. CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease. CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease. MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs. CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases. CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan. MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes. IMPRESSION: 1. Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs. 2. Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right. 3. Chronic pain syndrome. RECOMMENDATIONS: Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology. Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right. Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today. I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed. She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this. We have asked for stat protime today. She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications. She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms. Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed. I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday. I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead. She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan. I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation. Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings. Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:**  \nBack pain and pain in her right leg.\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nThe patient is here to talk about her pain. She has had small‑cell lung cancer for two years, and it has spread to both thigh bones, the lower part of her spine, and her pelvis. She has had many rounds of chemotherapy and radiation—she can’t count them all. She just finished a 10‑session radiation course to help with pain. The pain is still severe: mostly in her lower right back, shooting down the back of her right leg to her knee. She also feels numbness in the bottom of her left foot and sometimes sharp pain there. She has some diffuse pain in the middle back. She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching. On a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain), she rates her back pain 10 and her right leg pain 10. The pain gets worse when she sits in a car, sits for a long time, stands, or walks. She is taking a lot of narcotic pain medication. She has had many CT scans looking for cancer spread.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Small‑cell lung cancer with metastasis  \n- Depression\n\n**Past Surgical History:**  \n- Chest port placement\n\n**Current Medications:**  \n- Duragesic patch (total 250 µg)  \n- Celebrex 200 mg once daily  \n- Iron 240 mg twice daily  \n- Paxil 20 mg daily (she will stop this)  \n- Percocet (unknown strength, up to 8 tablets daily)  \n- Warfarin 1 mg daily (to keep the chest port open)  \n- Neurontin 300 mg three times daily\n\n**Habits:**  \n- Smokes 1 pack a day for 30 years  \n- Drinks beer about twice a day  \n- No recreational drugs\n\n**Social History:**  \nMarried, lives with spouse.\n\n**Family History:**  \nTwo brothers and her father had cancer.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \nMostly pain. Otherwise stable.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- Looks thin but friendly.  \n- Height 5 ft 2 in, weight 130 lb, no fever.  \n- Head, ears, nose, throat normal.  \n- Neck moves normally, no Spurling’s sign.  \n- Chest clear, heart regular.  \n- Abdomen soft, normal bowel sounds.  \n- Joints move normally, no muscle weakness.  \n- Looks deconditioned.  \n- Alert, oriented, normal mood.  \n- Normal muscle tone and coordination.  \n- Reflexes 2+ in knees, absent in ankles.  \n- Sensation decreased in left foot, otherwise normal.  \n- Lower back has normal curve, moves well, but tender over lower back facet and sacroiliac joints, which reproduces her back and leg pain.  \n- Gait normal, no limping.\n\n**Investigations:**  \n- Whole‑body bone scan: abnormal uptake in both thigh bones and sacroiliac joints.  \n- Chest CT: no new cancer.  \n- Abdominal CT: no new cancer.  \n- Hip MRI: mixed bone marrow signal in both upper thigh bones.  \n- Pelvis CT: healed metastases.  \n- Orbit CT: small fluid in right mastoid air cells, otherwise normal.  \n- Brain MRI: no new problems.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Small‑cell lung cancer that has spread to the lower spine, pelvis, and both thigh bones.  \n2. Pain from the right facet and sacroiliac joints.  \n3. Chronic pain syndrome.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nDr. XYZ and I explained her situation. She has cancer spread, but her main pain comes from the right facet and sacroiliac joints. Because of her severe pain, Dr. XYZ will do a fluoroscopy‑guided injection of her right sacroiliac and facet joints today. She understood the procedure, possible risks, and wants to proceed. She is on warfarin, so we will check her PT/INR today. She has had biopsies while on warfarin before with no problems. She is already taking a lot of narcotics. Dr. XYZ said that if she still has pain after the injection, she could add another 50 µg patch and a few more Percocet tablets if needed. I will see her again in the clinic on Tuesday. I asked her to stop Paxil and start Cymbalta instead; she agreed. I also asked her to get a lumbar spine X‑ray for further evaluation. The left foot numbness is most likely from her chemotherapy and radiation."
