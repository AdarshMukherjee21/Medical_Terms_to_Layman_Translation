  "medical": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis. SUBJECTIVE: The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort. These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her. She feels anxious and worried. She does not think she can take any more pain. She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help. They seem to be intensifying her pain. She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine. So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her. We discussed this at length. I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide. She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality. She had Hysterectomy in the past. MEDICATIONS: Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily. ALLERGIES: Compazine and Allegra. OBJECTIVE: Vital Signs: Weight: 140 pounds. Blood pressure: 132/90. Pulse: 102. Respirations: 18. Age: 27. PLAN: We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion. She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete. The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back. As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her. She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after todays instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Fridays appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend. I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out. PROCEDURE:: She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine. We waited about 20 minutes. The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed. The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder. She seemed to tolerate it moderately well. She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it. If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** The patient wants bladder treatments for chronic interstitial cystitis.\n\n**Subjective:** She arrived crying, saying she feels a lot of pain and the bladder treatments haven’t helped. She feels anxious and worried that she can’t handle more pain. She is thinking about going back to Dr. XYZ to ask for a nerve block or another treatment because she can’t manage daily life or care for her children without relief. She fears the bladder treatments might make her pain worse. She also worries about needing pain medication each time, which means she can’t drive and must have someone with her, which is difficult. We talked about this a lot. I told her it’s okay to stop the treatments if they’re too uncomfortable and not helpful, but sometimes people feel worse at first and then improve after finishing the treatments. Some people have had to stop because they couldn’t tolerate it and then tried other options. She had a hysterectomy before.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Premarin 1.25 mg daily  \n- Elmiron 100 mg three times a day  \n- Elavil 50 mg at bedtime  \n- OxyContin 10 mg (three tablets) three times a day  \n- Toprol XL 25 mg daily  \n\n**Allergies:** Compazine and Allegra.\n\n**Objective:**  \n- Weight: 140 lb  \n- Blood pressure: 132/90  \n- Pulse: 102  \n- Respirations: 18  \n- Age: 27  \n\n**Plan:** We discussed getting another opinion from Dr. XYZ. She called him recently, told him how bad she was feeling, and he said he thought she should finish the treatments and then he would see her again. She was encouraged to think about it and decide what to do. She said she didn’t want to quit now because she only had two or three treatments left, but she was worried about the holiday weekend. If she feels uncomfortable after today’s treatment, she will cancel Friday’s appointment and not worry about the weekend. I agreed that was reasonable.\n\n**Procedure:** She received 10 mg of morphine under the skin because she couldn’t tolerate the discomfort without pain medicine. After about 20 minutes, we performed the bladder treatment: the urethra was given lidocaine gel, then after 10 minutes the bladder was filled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate. The catheter was removed. She kept the solution in her bladder for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes, and then emptied her bladder. She tolerated it fairly well. She will call to let me know if she wants to keep the Friday appointment. If she tolerated today’s treatment, she may try it again; if not, she will cancel and start over next week or see Dr. Friesen."
