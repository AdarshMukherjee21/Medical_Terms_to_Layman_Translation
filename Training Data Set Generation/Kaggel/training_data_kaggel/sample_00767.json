  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is a 34-year-old right-handed female who states her symptoms first started after a motor vehicle accident in September 2005. She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved. Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain. She has been extensively worked up and treated for this. MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal. She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain. In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated. She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face. By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg. Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved. However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg. The face numbness has completely resolved. Symptoms are mild. She denies any previous similar episodes. She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function. There is no associated headache. Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination. Normal gait. Cranial nerves are intact. Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation. She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities. In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot. In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick. She describes it as a strange unusual sensation. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is normal. There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy. EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident. This was normal. Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year. Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms. Once she has the test done she will phone me and further management will be based on the results.",
  "layman": "**History:**  \nA 34‑year‑old right‑handed woman says her symptoms started after a car accident in September 2005. She may have briefly lost consciousness at that time, and for about a week after she had blurred vision that then went away. Since then she has had pain in the lower right side of her neck and the lower left side of her back. She has had many tests and treatments. MRIs of her cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine were normal. She has gotten better but still has pain.\n\nIn June of this year she had different symptoms that she thinks are unrelated. She felt chest pain and tightness in her left arm, left leg, and face. By the next morning she had numbness around her left lip and all of her left arm and leg. Those symptoms lasted about two days and then went away. Since then she has had occasional numbness in her left hand and left leg. The face numbness is gone. The symptoms are mild. She has never had similar episodes before. She does not have dizziness, vision changes, trouble coordinating movements, weakness, trouble walking, or bowel or bladder problems. She does not have headaches.\n\nA brief exam shows normal muscle strength, no drift when she holds her arms up, and no coordination problems. She walks normally. Her cranial nerves (brain‑stem functions) are fine. Sensation on her face is normal. She has normal light touch, temperature, and pinprick sensation in both arms. In her lower legs she feels a strange, unusual sensation on the outer part of her left calf and foot. Light touch and pinprick there are normal.  \n\n**Nerve Conduction Studies:**  \nMotor and sensory tests, including response times, amplitudes, speeds, and F‑waves, are normal in her left arm and leg.\n\n**Needle EMG:**  \nA needle test was done in her left leg, lower back muscles, right shin muscle, and right upper back muscles. It showed normal muscle activity, no abnormal spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit shape in all tested muscles.\n\n**Impression:**  \nThe electrical tests are normal. There is no sign of nerve damage, nerve entrapment, plexus problems, or nerve root issues. The EMG of her right upper back, where she has had a lot of pain since the car accident, was also normal. Because of her sudden left‑side face, arm, and leg weakness in June, and the normal EMG and spine MRIs, the doctor thinks she may have had a central (brain) event. Her current symptoms are mild. The doctor has ordered a brain MRI with and without contrast and a blood‑vessel scan (MRA) of the head and neck with contrast to investigate further. After the tests, she will call the doctor and further care will depend on the results."
