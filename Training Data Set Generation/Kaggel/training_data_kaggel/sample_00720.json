  "medical": "EXAM: Thoracic Spine. REASON FOR EXAM: Injury. INTERPRETATION: The thoracic spine was examined in the AP, lateral and swimmer's projections. There is mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent T11 and 12 vertebral bodies. A mild amount of anterior osteophytic lipping is seen involving the thoracic spine. There is a suggestion of generalized osteoporosis. The intervertebral disc spaces appear generally well preserved. The pedicles appear intact. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent the T11 and 12 vertebral bodies. 2. Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. 3. Osteoporosis.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Thoracic Spine. REASON FOR EXAM: Injury. INTERPRETATION: The back of the chest area of the spine was looked at from the front, side, and a special angle. The two lower middle spine bones (T11 and T12) look a little squashed on the front side, which seems to be a long‑term change. There are small bony growths on the front of the spine. The bones look generally weak, which may mean osteoporosis. The spaces between the spine bones (discs) look mostly normal. The small arms of the bones (pedicles) look fine. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild long‑term squashing of the T11 and T12 spine bones. 2. Mild wear‑and‑tear changes in the thoracic spine. 3. Osteoporosis."
