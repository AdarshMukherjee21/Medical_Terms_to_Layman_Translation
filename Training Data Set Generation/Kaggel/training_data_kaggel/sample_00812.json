  "medical": "Thank you very much for asking me to see this very interesting and pleasant woman for neurological evaluation with regards to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. She is present in the company of her husband. As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant. Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk. She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall. She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests. She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made. The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved. She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking. In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia. She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing. She was diagnosed as having &quot;overactive bladder&quot;, but the cause of this was never determined. She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit. She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it. Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable &quot;stiffness&quot; in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles. Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others. She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was &quot;not arthritis&quot;, but no definite diagnosis was ever established. She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal. No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms. However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat. She states from time-to-time she could &quot;barely walk&quot;. She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were &quot;walking on stilts&quot;. She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit. She began to tire more easily when walking. In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist. In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X. He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine. He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing. After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis. However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003. Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex. She continued on it for about six months. However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it. She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy. So, she discontinued it also. At that point in time, she decided to try a program of &quot;good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil&quot;. In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities. She began to have to use a cane. She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z. She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak. Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically. However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline. She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005). This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial. However, it wore off once again. A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to &quot;look better&quot;. She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit. Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets. She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs. She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity. She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents. The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability. There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essentially noncontributory. ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN. She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke. She takes one glass of wine per day. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has not had any prior surgeries. Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems. REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES: The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet. There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum. There appear to be Dawson's fingers. The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities. Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05. The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions. However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal. Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord. It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5&ordm;F, and weight 124 lb (dressed). General: Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress. Head: Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits. Neck: Supple, with full range of motion. No spasm or tenderness. Carotid pulsations are of normal volume and contour bilaterally without bruits. No thyromegaly or adenopathy. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or deformity. Range of motion full throughout. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Mental Status: Awake, alert, oriented to time, place, and person; appropriate. Recent and remote memory intact. No evidence of right-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysnomia or aphasia. CRANIAL NERVES: II: Visual fields full to confrontation. Fundi benign. III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus. No ptosis. Pupils equal, round and react briskly to light and accommodation. V: Normal sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally. Corneal reflexes equal bilaterally. Motor function normal. VII: No facial asymmetry. VIII: Hears finger rub bilaterally. Weber and Rinne tests normal. IX & X: Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation. Gag reflex equal bilaterally. XI: Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally. XII: Tongue midline without atrophy or fasciculations. Rapid alternating movements normal. No dysarthria. Motor: Tone, bulk, and strength are normal in both upper extremities. In the lower extremities, there is moderate spasticity on the right and moderately severe spasticity on the left. There are bilateral Achilles' contractures more so on the left than the right and also a slight left knee flexion contracture. Strength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left): Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5. There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements. Reflexes (right/left): Biceps 3/3, triceps 3/3, brachioradialis 3/3, knee jerk 4/4, and ankle jerk 4/0. Plantar responses are extensor bilaterally. No pathological reflexes. Coordination: Finger-nose-finger testing and rapid alternating movements appear to be normal in both upper extremities. The lower extremities could not be adequately tested because of spasticity and weakness. Gait: The patient has a spastic and slightly broad based gait. She is able to walk without support. After walking for a period of time, she is finally able to get her left foot down flat, but tends to walk on the left toes. Station: Romberg testing with the eyes open is normal. With the eyes closed, there is slight unsteadiness and she actually fell on one occasion, but was able to catch herself. Sensation: Intact to pinprick, light touch, vibration and position sense throughout. Normal stereognosis, graphesthesia, and double simultaneous stimulation DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Multiple sclerosis, ? secondary progressive versus relapsing/remitting. CASE DISCUSSION: Thank you once again for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting lady. Based on review of her history and her current MRI scans, she seems to suffer from multiple sclerosis. She indicated that there was a slow progression of her disease from December 2004 to February 2005 and perhaps beyond that. She also indicated that she has some improvement with oral steroids and to a lesser extent with IV steroids. However, she keeps slipping back. Overall however, she thinks that she is better now than she was several months ago suggesting that this may have been a slow exacerbation rather than actual progression of her MS. At this point in time, she appears to be confusing symptom treatment with treatment of her multiple sclerosis. Steroids can relieve spasticity in selected patients. However, they are not good long-term choices because of the obvious side effects that we see with long-term use of steroids. So, although she has benefit from the current prednisone dosage, I feel it would be more appropriate to try and find something else to help her with her spasticity. She is unable to tolerate Zanaflex and baclofen because of sedation. I have recommended a trial of Neurontin beginning at 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. and gradually increasing as needed up to 300 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Additional increases may be necessary depending on how she does with these lower doses. Some patients may take as high as 1000-1500 mg three to four times daily. If the Neurontin cannot be tolerated or it does not bring about any relief of her spasticity, I would consider Klonopin 0.25 mg-1 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. or Valium 5-10 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. If these are not helpful or if there are intolerable side effects, she should be considered for baclofen pump. I spent a lot of time discussing with her baclofen pump, as she was unfamiliar with it, although she has initially and understandably opposed to this treatment, she may well require this treatment in the future in order to allow her to ambulate adequately. With the baclofen pump in place, the patient should have good relief of spasticity and be able to exercise her legs strongly. It is not clear to me whether she is actually having secondary progressive MS or relapsing/remitting MS. I feel it would be appropriate to start her on immunomodulatory therapy. Since interferon made her spasticity worse, I would recommend a trial of Copaxone. I would also obtain an annual MRI scan of the brain; however, this should be accomplished with a high-field strength magnet (1.5-Tesla or greater). If she has worsening of her clinical condition or should her MRI show continued worsening, I would recommend consideration of adding methotrexate or CellCept to her regimen. She may also be a candidate for Tysabri if it returns to the market place in the next few months. She is currently not much troubled by her bladder symptoms and so I do not think she needs any particular treatment for this problem currently. However, should her symptoms worsen in the future, urological consultation by a physician familiar with neurogenic bladder would be helpful. Finally, I feel that she will benefit from some physical therapy. I have recommended physical therapy evaluation and treatment three times weekly for six weeks. The patient currently has HMO insurance and I recommended that she followup here on an as needed basis. She should followup with you for her regularly scheduled medical appointments. The patient indicates that she may be moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the near future and I gave her the names of two MS physicians in Dallas, which is apparently only about a two-hour ride away. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about her case.",
  "layman": "Thank you for asking me to evaluate this friendly woman for possible multiple sclerosis. She is here with her husband.\n\nShe is a 50‑year‑old right‑handed white woman who works as an independent contractor and HR consultant.\n\nHer first neurological problem started in December 1987, when she suddenly had slurred speech and felt hesitant when she began to walk. She had HMO insurance then and saw a neurologist she does not remember. She believes she had a brain MRI and maybe visual and auditory tests. The doctor said all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was given. Her slurred speech got better after a few weeks, but her hesitant walking stayed for many years and only partly improved. She also noticed that she got tired after walking for a long time.\n\nAround 1993 she started having urgent and frequent urination, including nighttime trips to the bathroom. She saw a urologist and had bladder function tests. She was told she had an overactive bladder, but the reason was unclear. She tried medication, maybe Ditropan, but it didn’t help much. The medicine also made her mouth dry, so she stopped it.\n\nAlso in 1993 she felt stiffness in her feet and slight ankle swelling that others couldn’t see. She saw many doctors who said it was not arthritis, but no clear diagnosis was found. She visited at least two rheumatologists several times, and all blood tests were normal. She just learned to live with these symptoms.\n\nOver time her leg symptoms got worse. She sometimes could barely walk and felt unsteady, like walking on stilts. A podiatrist gave her arch supports, but they didn’t help. She also got tired more quickly when walking.\n\nIn 2002 a podiatrist saw her, noticed her abnormal walking, and told her to see a neurologist.\n\nIn fall 2002 she saw Dr. X. He ordered a brain and lower spine MRI and did nerve tests, maybe visual tests. He diagnosed her with multiple sclerosis. Before starting treatment, he sent her for a second opinion with Dr. Y in January 2003.\n\nDr. Y agreed the diagnosis. She went back to Dr. X and started the medicine Avonex. She took it for about six months, but it made her feel stiffer and slower, so she stopped it. She also tried baclofen from Dr. X, but it didn’t help and made her a little dizzy, so she stopped it.\n\nAfter that she started a plan of healthy eating, vitamin supplements, and fish oil.\n\nFrom December 2004 to February 2005 she noticed increasing swelling and stiffness in her lower legs and feet, and she had to use a cane.\n\nDr. Z saw her and gave her a Medrol Dosepak (steroid pill). Her stiffness and swelling improved a lot, but after about two weeks the symptoms returned to how they were before. Later she got five days of IV Solu‑Medrol 500 mg each day, then a taper of prednisone or Medrol in July 2005. It helped a little, but not as much as the oral steroids. But the relief faded again. A brain MRI in April 2005 was reported to look better. She was given Zanaflex for leg stiffness, but it didn’t help.\n\nSix days ago she started oral prednisone 10 mg tablets again. She takes half a tablet each day, and it seems to reduce swelling and stiffness in her legs. She keeps taking the same dose for relief.\n\nShe hasn’t taken any other disease‑modifying medicines. She does feel a little more sensitive to heat and gets tired easily. She has never had double vision, slurred speech, language problems, weakness in one area, numbness, tingling, or memory or thinking problems.\n\nPast medical history: basically nothing important.  \nAllergies: she is allergic to lobster and Vicodin. She thinks she may also be allergic to iodine.  \nSocial history: she doesn’t smoke and drinks one glass of wine each day.  \nPast surgeries: none. Overall she has been in good health except for the problems mentioned.\n\n**Review of outside imaging**  \nShe brought MRI scans from 11/14/02 taken on a 1.5‑Tesla machine. The brain scan shows many bright spots (lesions) in the white matter near the ventricles and below the cortex, including one in the corpus callosum. There are also “Dawson’s fingers”—a typical MS sign. The spine scans of the chest and lower back show no major problems.  \nShe also had another set of scans on 04/22/05 using a 0.35‑Tesla machine. The brain scan shows that one old lesion has gone away, but there may be one or two new lesions. The scan quality is lower, so the spinal cord is not seen clearly. No obvious problems were seen, but we can’t be sure there are no hidden lesions.\n\n**Physical exam**  \nVital signs—BP 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5 °F, weight 124 lb (clothed). She looks healthy and not in any immediate distress.  \nHead: normal shape, no signs of injury or abnormal sounds. Neck: flexible, moves freely, no tightness or pain. Carotid pulses normal, no abnormal sounds. No enlarged thyroid or lymph nodes.  \nLimbs: no clubbing, blue discoloration, swelling, or deformities. Full range of motion.\n\n**Neurological exam**  \nShe is awake, alert, knows where she is and when. She remembers recent and old events. No confusion about left/right, no trouble recognizing fingers, naming, or language.  \nVision is normal, eye movements normal, pupils equal and react quickly. Sensation to light touch and pinprick is normal. Cornea reflexes normal. No facial weakness. Hearing is normal. Palate moves evenly, gag reflex normal. Neck muscles normal. Tongue is centered, no twitching. Quick movements are fine. Speech is normal.  \nUpper arms and hands are normal. Lower legs have moderate stiffness on the right and more stiffness on the left. Both Achilles tendons are tight, especially on the left, and the left knee is slightly bent. Strength in the lower legs (rated 0‑5) is: hip flexors 4+/5‑, thigh muscles 5‑/5‑, shin muscle 4+/4+, calf 5/5. No tremors or twitching.  \nReflexes: Biceps, triceps, forearm, knee, and ankle reflexes are normal. Foot reflexes point upward. No abnormal reflexes.  \nCoordination: Hand tests are normal. Leg tests couldn’t be done because of stiffness and weakness.  \nWalking: She walks with stiffness and a slightly wide stance. She can walk without help. After walking for a while, she can put her left foot flat but often walks on her left toes.  \nBalance: With eyes open, she is steady. With eyes closed, she is a little unsteady and once fell but caught herself.  \nSensation: She feels pinprick, light touch, vibration, and position normally. She can identify objects by touch, read numbers by touch, and sense two simultaneous stimuli.\n\n**Diagnosis**  \nMultiple sclerosis, possibly secondary progressive or relapsing/remitting.\n\n**Case discussion**  \nThank you again for letting me help with her care. Her history and MRI scans show she has multiple sclerosis. She says her symptoms slowly worsened from December 2004 to February 2005 and maybe later. She says oral steroids help a bit, IV steroids less so, but the relief fades. Overall she feels better now than a few months ago, so it may be a flare rather than real progression.\n\nRight now she seems to mix treating symptoms with treating the disease. Steroids can ease stiffness in some people, but they are not good for long‑term use because of side effects. Even though prednisone helps, I think we should look for another way to reduce her stiffness.\n\nShe can’t take Zanaflex or baclofen because they make her sleepy. I suggested trying Neurontin, starting at 100 mg twice or three times a day, and slowly raising the dose to 300 mg twice or three times a day if needed. Some people take up to 1000‑1500 mg three or four times a day.  \nIf Neurontin doesn’t work or she can’t tolerate it, I would think about Klonopin 0.25‑1 mg three or four times a day, or Valium 5‑10 mg three or four times a day. If those still don’t help or cause bad side effects, she might need a baclofen pump.\n\nI talked a lot with her about a baclofen pump. She didn’t know about it and was hesitant, but she might need it later to walk better. A baclofen pump should help her stiffness and let her move her legs more.\n\nI’m not sure if she has secondary progressive or relapsing/remitting MS. I think she should start disease‑modifying medicine. Because interferon made her stiffness worse, I would suggest trying Copaxone. I would also get a yearly brain MRI, using a 1.5‑Tesla or stronger machine. If her symptoms get worse or her MRI shows more damage, I would think about adding methotrexate or CellCept. She might also qualify for Tysabri if it becomes available again soon.\n\nHer bladder problems are not bothering her much, so she doesn’t need treatment right now. If her bladder issues get worse, a urologist who knows about nerve‑related bladder problems would help.\n\nFinally, she should get physical therapy three times a week for six weeks. She has HMO insurance. I suggested she come back as needed. She should keep her regular appointments with you. She says she might move to Tulsa, Oklahoma soon. I gave her the names of two MS doctors in Dallas, about a two‑hour drive away.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you have any questions about her."
