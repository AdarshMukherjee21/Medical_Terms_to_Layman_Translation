Disc degeneration at C3-C4 and C6-C7. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with possible pseudoarthrosis at C4-C5. 2. Cervical radiculopathy involving the left arm. 3. Disc degeneration at C3-C4 and C6-C7. OPERATIVE PROCEDURES 1. Decompressive left lumbar laminectomy C4-C5 and C5-C6 with neural foraminotomy. 2. Posterior cervical fusion C4-C5. 3. Songer wire. 4. Right iliac bone graft. TECHNIQUE: The patient was brought to the operating room. Preoperative evaluations included previous cervical spine surgery. The patient initially had some relief; however, his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse. Repeat studies including myelogram and postspinal CTs revealed some blunting of the nerve root at C4-C5 and C5-C6. There was also noted to be some annular bulges at C3-C4, and C6-C7. The CT scan in March revealed that the fusion was not fully solid. X-rays were done in November including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion was solid. The patient had been on pain medication. The patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments. He was given the option of surgical intervention. We discussed Botox, I discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression. I explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it was from the anterior surgery. If at the time of surgery there was some motion of the C4-C5 level, I would recommend a fusion. The patient was a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but has not quit smoking. I have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft. I explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life. Even if this type of bone graft was used, there was no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely. The patient also was advised that if I did a fusion, I would also use post instrumentation, which was a wire. The wire would be left permanently. Even with all these procedures, there was no guarantee that his symptoms would improve. His numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist. He still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure. Other procedures may be necessary later. There is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function. He could lose total control of his arms or legs and end up in the bed for the rest of his life. He could develop chronic regional pain syndromes. He could get difficulty swallowing or eating. He could have substantial weakness in the arm. He was advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting. He was also offered his records if he would like any other pain medications or seek other treatments, he was advised that Dr. X would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery. He stated he understood all the risks. He did not wish to get any other treatments. He said the pain has reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: In the operating room, he was given general endotracheal anesthesia. I then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls. His head was controlled by a horseshoe holder. The anesthesiologist checked the eye positions to make sure there was no pressure on the orbits and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes. The arms, the right hip, and the neck was then prepped and draped. Care was taken to position both arms and both legs. Pulses were checked. A midline incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine. A loupe magnification and headlamp illumination was used. Bleeding vessels were cauterized. Meticulous hemostasis was carried out throughout the procedure. Gradually and carefully I exposed the spinous process of the C6, C5, and C4. A lateral view was done after an instrument in place. This revealed the C6-C7 level. I therefore did a small laminotomy opening at C4-C5. I placed an instrument and x-rays confirmed C4-C5 level. I stripped the muscles from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self-retaining retractor. Once I identified the level, I then used a bur to thin the lamina of C5. I used a 1-mm, followed by a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off C5 on the left. I removed some of the superior lamina of C6 and some of the inferior lamina of C4. This allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve roots and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the C5 and C6 nerve roots. There was some bleeding from the epidural veins and a bipolar cautery was used. Absolutely no retractors were ever placed in the canal. There was no retraction. I was able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc spaces to make sure there was no fragments of disc or herniation disc and none were found. At the end of the procedure, the neuroforamen were widely patent. The nerve roots had been fully decompressed. I then checked stability. There was micromotion at the C4-C5 level. I therefore elected to proceed with a fusion. I debrided the interspinous ligament between C4 and C5. I used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of C5 and the inferior portion of C4. Using a small drill, I opened the facet at C4-C5. I then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage. I used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at C4-C5. Attention was turned to the right and left hip, which was also prepped. An incision made over the iliac crest. Bleeding vessels were cauterized. I exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest. I removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bone. I placed the Songer wire through the base of the spinous process of C4 and C5. Drill holes made with a clip. I then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process. I then tightened the Songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wire. Prior to tightening the wire, I also packed cancellous bone with facet at C4-C5. I then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of C4 and C5. The hip wound was irrigated with bacitracin and Kantrex. Deep structures were closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous suture and subcuticular tissue was closed. No drain was placed in the hip. A drain was left in the posterior cervical spine. The deep tissues were closed with 0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue and skin were then closed. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. After a previous surgery that removed part of the neck bones (C4‑C5 and C5‑C6) and joined them together, the bone at C4‑C5 may not have fused properly.  \n2. Pain and weakness in the left arm caused by pressure on a nerve in the neck.  \n3. Wear‑and‑tear of the discs at C3‑C4 and C6‑C7.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \nThe same three conditions listed above.  \n\n**Operative procedures**  \n1. Removal of part of the bone at the back of the neck (C4‑C5 and C5‑C6) to relieve pressure on nerves.  \n2. Fusion of the neck bones at C4‑C5 from the back.  \n3. Placement of a metal wire (Songer wire) to hold the bones together.  \n4. Harvesting bone from the right hip to use as a graft.  \n\n**Technique – what happened in the operating room**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia. He was positioned on special rolls and his head was held in a horseshoe‑shaped holder. The anesthesiologist checked his eyes every 15 minutes to make sure they were not being pressed. The arms, right hip, and neck were cleaned and covered.  \n\nA straight cut was made in the skin and tissue over the neck. The surgeon used a magnifying lens and a bright light. Blood vessels were cauterized (cooled with heat) to stop bleeding. The surgeon carefully exposed the bone at the top of the neck (C6, C5, C4).  \n\nA small opening was made in the bone at C4‑C5. The surgeon used a drill and small bone‑cutting tools to thin and remove part of the bone on the left side of C5 and the upper part of C6 and lower part of C4. This opened the space where the spinal cord and nerves sit. The surgeon checked that no disc fragments were left behind. The nerve roots were fully freed from pressure.  \n\nThe surgeon then checked the stability of the neck. There was slight movement at C4‑C5, so a fusion was performed. The surgeon cleaned the joint surfaces and removed cartilage.  \n\nThe right hip was cleaned and a small cut was made over the top of the hip bone (iliac crest). Bone was removed and the inner spongy bone was taken out.  \n\nA metal wire was threaded through the base of the C4 and C5 bones. Small holes were drilled and the wire was tightened to hold the bones together. Cancellous (spongy) bone from the hip was packed between the cleaned bone surfaces and the wire. The hip wound was washed with antibiotic solution and closed with stitches. No drain was left in the hip. A drain was left in the neck to remove any fluid. The neck tissues were closed with stitches, and the skin was closed with a running stitch.  \n\nThe patient was moved to the recovery room in good condition.  \n\n**What the doctor explained to the patient**  \nThe doctor reviewed the patient’s previous neck surgery and explained that the pain in the left arm had come back and was getting worse. Imaging showed pressure on the nerves at C4‑C5 and C5‑C6 and bulging discs at C3‑C4 and C6‑C7. The earlier fusion had not fully solidified, but later X‑rays showed it looked stable.  \n\nThe patient had tried medication and other non‑surgical treatments. The doctor offered surgery and explained that a back‑side neck surgery would leave a larger scar, cause more bleeding, and be more painful than the front‑side surgery. The doctor also explained that if there was still movement at C4‑C5 during surgery, a fusion would be needed.  \n\nThe patient smokes and was told quitting smoking would improve the chances of the bone graft fusing. The doctor explained that the bone graft would create a scar on the back of the right hip that could cause long‑term pain. Even with the graft, fusion was not guaranteed, and the patient was urged to stop smoking completely.  \n\nIf a fusion was done, a metal wire would be left permanently. The doctor warned that none of these procedures could guarantee relief. The numbness, tingling, weakness, neck pain, and arm pain could get worse. The patient still had shoulder inflammation that would not be fixed by this surgery. Other procedures might be needed later.  \n\nThe doctor listed serious risks: becoming paralyzed, losing bowel or bladder control, losing arm or leg control, chronic pain, difficulty swallowing or eating, and severe arm weakness. The patient was advised to consider surgery only if the pain was severe, persistent, and unrelieved by other treatments.  \n\nThe patient was offered his medical records and told that the doctor would continue to prescribe pain medication if he chose not to have surgery. The patient understood all the risks, declined other treatments, and said the pain had become unbearable, so he decided to proceed with surgery."
