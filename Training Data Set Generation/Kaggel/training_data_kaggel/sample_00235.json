  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left acoustic neuroma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left acoustic neuroma. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma. ANESTHESIA: General. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma. The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve. The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery. She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins. The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion. Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified. The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease. The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use. Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip. Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone. Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax. Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure. Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed. The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly. From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed. Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use. The bone flap was also left at the site for further use. Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base. Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus. There was extensively aerated temporal bone. At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor. The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure. Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone. The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone. Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out. The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm. There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well. The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor. The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult. Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor. With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem. The eighth nerve was identified and transected. Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem. The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well. It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve. Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed. The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus. At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct. The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated. The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor. The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face. Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally. However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated. However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness. It was released from the brainstem ventrally. The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery. The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes. Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume. At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis. The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax. A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect. Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal. The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect. Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels. Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition. All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100 mL.",

It could not be taken out completely; a small piece was left near the facial nerve at the cerebellopontine angle. The facial nerve was tested at the brainstem with a very low electrical current (0.05 mA) after the main part of the surgery.\n\n**PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:**  \nAfter the patient was put under general anesthesia, she was turned onto her side and her head was fixed with a Mayfield head clamp. The skin and tissue around the left ear were shaved, cleaned, and covered with sterile drapes. Electrodes were attached to monitor the facial nerve, and no nerve activity was seen before surgery.\n\nThe surgeon injected 1 % lidocaine with epinephrine into the planned incision area. A T‑shaped cut was made about 5 cm behind the ear crease. The skin and underlying tissue were lifted to expose the temporalis fascia, which was saved for later use. The incision was extended down over the mastoid tip. A periosteal elevator lifted the bone covering the mastoid and the front part of the occipital bone. Small veins behind the sigmoid sinus were cauterized and sealed with bone wax. Retractors kept the area open.\n\nA craniotomy (removal of a bone window) was made with a cutting drill, suction, and irrigation. The sigmoid sinus and transverse sinus were identified, and a 4 × 4 cm bone window was removed. Bone fragments were collected in a special solution for later use, and the bone flap was kept for later placement.\n\nThe surgeon extended the opening along the lower part of the sigmoid sinus to expose more of the skull base. Bone wax sealed air cells next to the sigmoid sinus. The temporal bone was highly aerated (full of air spaces). Dr. Trask then opened the dura (the outer brain covering) and exposed the tumor. The cerebellum was gently pulled away, and a retractor kept it out of the way.\n\nThe dura was cut around the internal auditory canal (the bony tube that carries the hearing and balance nerves). Diamond drills removed bone from the canal about 8 mm wide. The canal was aerated too. The dura was opened over the canal, exposing the part of the tumor inside the canal. The tumor reached all the way to the back of the canal, making it hard to see the facial nerve. Dr. Trask went back to free the tumor from the brainstem and to shrink the central part of the tumor. He separated the tumor from the trigeminal nerve (the facial pain nerve) and lifted it away from the back of the brainstem. The eighth nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve) was cut. Shrinking the tumor allowed the capsule to move away from the brainstem.\n\nThe facial nerve was hard to see at the brainstem. It was found using an electrical stimulator, but separating it from the tumor was difficult. The surgeon focused on the internal auditory canal, removed the tumor there, and cut the superior and inferior vestibular nerves. Dissection followed the facial nerve toward the canal, but the plane was still unclear. The tumor was freed from the canal and could be rotated. The surgeon shrank and thinned the tumor, but the nerve on the front of the tumor was still hard to see. The nerve could be stimulated, but it was spread out over the tumor’s front. More shrinking was done, trying to find a clear path around the nerve both near and far. The front part of the tumor at the cerebellopontine angle was still not clearly separated from the nerve. The surgeon thinned the tumor with a CUSA (ultrasonic aspirator) to a 1–2 mm thick sheath, then released it from the front of the brainstem. The tumor was cauterized with bipolar electrocautery. The facial nerve was stimulated again at the brainstem and responded easily at 0.05 mA. Only a very small amount of tumor remained.\n\nDr. Trask checked the back of the skull to make sure there was no bleeding. Air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed with muscle and bone wax. A piece of fascia was laid over the bone hole. The dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal (sealants). The bone flap and the bone pieces were placed back into the hole. The muscles around the ear were stitched together with 3‑0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with 3‑0 Vicryl sutures under the skin and a running 4‑0 nylon suture on the skin surface. A sterile mastoid dressing was applied.\n\nThe patient tolerated the surgery well and was moved to the post‑anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition. All surgical counts were correct at the end of the procedure. Estimated blood loss was about 100 mL."
