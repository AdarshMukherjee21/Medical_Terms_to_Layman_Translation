  "medical": "EXAM: CT cervical spine (C-spine) for trauma. FINDINGS: CT examination of the cervical spine was performed without contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained for better anatomical localization. Cervical vertebral body height, alignment and interspacing are maintained. There is no evidence of fractures or destructive osseous lesions. There are no significant degenerative endplate or facet changes. No significant osseous central canal or foraminal narrowing is present. IMPRESSION: Negative cervical spine.",

Images were taken from different angles to help see the bones clearly. The neck bones are the right height, straight, and the spaces between them are normal. There are no breaks or bone damage. The joints and bone ends look normal, with no major wear. The spaces where the spinal cord and nerves travel are not narrowed. IMPRESSION: No problems found in the cervical spine."
