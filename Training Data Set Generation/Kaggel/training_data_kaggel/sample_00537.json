  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Upper endoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dysphagia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. GERD, biopsied. 2. Distal esophageal reflux-induced stricture, dilated to 18 mm. 3. Otherwise normal upper endoscopy. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 125 mcg and Versed 7 mg slow IV push. INDICATIONS: This is a 50-year-old white male with dysphagia, which has improved recently with Aciphex. FINDINGS: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered. The oropharynx was sprayed with Cetacaine. The endoscope was passed, under direct visualization, into the esophagus. The squamocolumnar junction was irregular and edematous. Biopsies were obtained for histology. There was a mild ring at the LES, which was dilated with a 15 to 18 mm balloon, with no resultant mucosal trauma. The entire gastric mucosa was normal, including a retroflexed view of the fundus. The entire duodenal mucosa was normal to the second portion. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. IMPRESSION: 1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, biopsied. 2. Distal esophageal reflux-induced stricture, dilated to 18 mm. 3. Otherwise normal upper endoscopy. PLAN: I will await the results of the biopsies. The patient was told to continue maintenance Aciphex and anti-reflux precautions. He will follow up with me on a p.r.n. basis.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Upper endoscopy (a camera exam of the throat, esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine).  \n\n**Before the procedure:** The patient had trouble swallowing (dysphagia).  \n\n**After the procedure:**  \n1. The patient has gastro‑esophageal reflux disease (GERD); tissue samples were taken for testing.  \n2. The lower part of the esophagus had a narrowing caused by reflux; it was widened to 18 mm with a balloon.  \n3. The rest of the upper digestive tract looked normal.  \n\n**Medications given:**  \n- Fentanyl 125 mcg (pain relief)  \n- Versed 7 mg (to relax)  \n- Cetacaine spray to numb the throat  \n\n**Why the procedure was done:** A 50‑year‑old white man had swallowing problems that had gotten better with Aciphex (a reflux medication).  \n\n**What was seen during the exam:**  \n- The patient lay on his left side.  \n- The throat was sprayed with Cetacaine.  \n- The camera was guided into the esophagus.  \n- The junction where the esophagus meets the stomach looked irregular and swollen; tissue samples were taken.  \n- A mild ring was found at the lower esophageal sphincter (LES); it was widened with a 15‑18 mm balloon without damaging the lining.  \n- The stomach lining was normal, including the upper part (fundus).  \n- The first part of the small intestine (duodenum) was normal up to the second portion.  \n- The patient tolerated the exam well and had no complications.  \n\n**Summary of findings:**  \n1. GERD, with tissue samples taken.  \n2. Narrowing in the lower esophagus caused by reflux, widened to 18 mm.  \n3. The rest of the upper endoscopy was normal.  \n\n**Plan:**  \n- Wait for the biopsy results.  \n- The patient was advised to keep taking Aciphex and to follow anti‑reflux precautions.  \n- He will see the doctor as needed (prn)."
