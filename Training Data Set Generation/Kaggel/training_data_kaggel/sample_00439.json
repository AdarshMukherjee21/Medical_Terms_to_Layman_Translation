  "medical": "EXAM: Echocardiogram. INDICATION: Aortic stenosis. INTERPRETATION: Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed of adequate technical quality. Left ventricle reveals concentric hypertrophy with normal size and dimensions and normal function. Ejection fraction is 60% without any obvious wall motion abnormality. Left atrium and right side chambers are of normal size and dimensions. Aortic root has normal diameter. Mitral and tricuspid valves are structurally normal except for minimal annular calcification. Valvular leaflet excursion is adequate. Aortic valve reveals annular calcification. Fibrocalcific valve leaflets with decreased excursion. Atrial and ventricular septum are intact. Pericardium is intact without any effusion. No obvious intracardiac mass or thrombi noted. Doppler reveals mild mitral regurgitation, mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Estimated pulmonary pressure of 48. Systolic consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary hypertension. Peak velocity across the aortic valve is 3.0 with a peak gradient of 37, mean gradient of 19, valve area calculated at 1.1 sq. cm consistent with moderate aortic stenosis. IN SUMMARY: 1. Concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with normal function. 2. Doppler study as above, most pronounced being moderate aortic stenosis, valve area of 1.1 sq. cm.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Heart ultrasound (echocardiogram).  \nINDICATION: Narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis).  \n\nINTERPRETATION:  \nA standard ultrasound of the heart was done and the image quality was good.  \nThe left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) is thickened evenly (concentric hypertrophy) but its size and shape are normal and it works normally. The ejection fraction, which measures how much blood the heart pumps out, is 60% and there is no obvious problem with the heart walls moving.  \nThe left atrium and the right side of the heart are normal in size.  \nThe aortic root (the part of the aorta that comes out of the heart) is normal in size.  \nThe mitral and tricuspid valves look normal except for a small amount of calcium on the ring that holds them. The leaflets of these valves move well.  \nThe aortic valve has calcium on its ring and the valve leaflets are thickened with calcium (fibrocalcific). Because of this, the leaflets do not move as much as they should.  \nThe walls that separate the heart chambers (septum) are intact.  \nThe pericardium (the sac around the heart) is intact and there is no fluid build‑up.  \nNo abnormal masses or blood clots were seen inside the heart.  \n\nDoppler (blood flow study) shows:  \n- Mild leaking of the mitral valve (mitral regurgitation).  \n- Mild to moderate leaking of the tricuspid valve (tricuspid regurgitation).  \n- Estimated pressure in the lungs is 48 mmHg, which is mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.  \n\nAcross the aortic valve:  \n- Peak speed of blood is 3.0 m/s.  \n- Peak pressure difference (gradient) is 37 mmHg.  \n- Average pressure difference is 19 mmHg.  \n- Calculated valve area is 1.1 square centimeters, which indicates moderate aortic stenosis.  \n\nSUMMARY:  \n1. The left ventricle is thickened evenly but works normally.  \n2. The main finding is moderate aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.1 square centimeters."
