  "medical": "This is a low stress, high rest 1-day protocol; however the patient had the resting study done today. CLINICAL INDICATION: Chest pain. INTERPRETATION: The patient received 14.9 mCi of Cardiolite for the rest portion of the study and 11.5 mCi of Cardiolite for the stress portion of the study. The patient's baseline EKG was normal sinus rhythm. The patient was stressed according to Bruce protocol by Dr. X. Exercise test was supervised and interpreted by Dr. X. Please see the separate report for stress portion of the study. The myocardial perfusion SPECT study shows there is mild anteroseptal fixed defect seen, which is most likely secondary to soft tissue attenuation artifact. There is, however, mild partially reversible perfusion defect seen, which is more pronounced in the stress images and short-axis view suggestive of minimal ischemia in the inferolateral wall. The gated SPECT study shows normal wall motion and wall thickening with calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 59%. CONCLUSION: 1. The exercise myocardial perfusion study shows possibility of mild ischemia in the inferolateral wall. 2. Normal LV systolic function with LV ejection fraction of 59%.",
  "layman": "This is a low‑stress, high‑rest one‑day test, but the patient had the rest part done today.  \n**Reason for the test:** Chest pain.  \n\n**What was done:** The patient received 14.9 mCi of Cardiolite for the rest part and 11.5 mCi for the stress part. The baseline EKG was normal. The patient was exercised using the Bruce protocol by Dr. X, who also supervised and interpreted the exercise test. See the separate report for the stress portion.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The SPECT scan shows a mild fixed defect in the front‑left part of the heart, probably caused by soft‑tissue interference.  \n- There is also a mild, partly reversible defect that is clearer on the stress images and in the short‑axis view, suggesting a small amount of reduced blood flow in the lower‑side wall of the heart.  \n- The gated SPECT shows normal wall motion and thickening, with a left‑ventricular ejection fraction of 59%.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n1. The exercise test suggests a possible mild reduction in blood flow in the lower‑side wall of the heart.  \n2. The left ventricle is pumping normally, with an ejection fraction of 59%."
