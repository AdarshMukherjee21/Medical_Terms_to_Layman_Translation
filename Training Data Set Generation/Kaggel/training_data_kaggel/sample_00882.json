  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Retained hardware in left elbow. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Retained hardware in left elbow. PROCEDURE: Hardware removal in the left elbow. ANESTHESIA: Procedure done under general anesthesia. The patient also received 4 mL of 0.25% Marcaine of local anesthetic. TOURNIQUET: There is no tourniquet time. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 5-year, 8-month-old male who presented to me direct from ED with distracted left lateral condyle fracture. He underwent screw compression for the fracture in October 2007. The fracture has subsequently healed and the patient presents for hardware removal. The risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. The risks of surgery include the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of extremity, failure of removal of hardware, failure to relieve pain or improved range of motion. All questions were answered and the family agreed to the above plan. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient's left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. Using his previous incision, dissection was carried down through the screw. A guide wire was placed inside the screw and the screw was removed without incident. The patient had an extension lag of about 15 to 20 degrees. Elbow is manipulated and his arm was able to be extended to zero degrees dorsiflex. The washer was also removed without incident. Wound was then irrigated and closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl. Wound was injected with 0.25% Marcaine. The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x4 and bias. The patient tolerated the procedure well and subsequently taken to the recovery in stable condition. DISCHARGE NOTE: The patient will be discharged on date of surgery. He is to follow up in one week's time for a wound check. This can be done at his primary care physician's office. The patient should keep his postop dressing for about 4 to 5 days. He may then wet the wound, but not scrub it. The patient may resume regular activities in about 2 weeks. The patient was given Tylenol with Codeine 10 mL p.o. every 3 to 4 hours p.r.n.",

The patient also received 4 mL of 0.25 % Marcaine (a local anesthetic).  \n**Tourniquet:** No tourniquet was used.  \n**Estimated blood loss:** Minimal.  \n**Complications:** None during the operation.  \n\n**History and physical:**  \nThe patient is a 5‑year‑8‑month‑old boy who came straight from the emergency department with a displaced fracture of the left elbow’s outer part. In October 2007 he had screws put in to hold the fracture. The fracture has since healed, and he is now having the screws removed. We talked about the risks and benefits of the surgery. Risks include problems with anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in feeling or movement of the arm, the screws not being fully removed, or the surgery not relieving pain or improving movement. All questions were answered and the family agreed to go ahead.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room and laid on his back. General anesthesia was given. The left arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. Using the old incision, the surgeon went down to the screw. A guide wire was put into the screw and the screw was removed safely. The boy had a slight lag of about 15‑20 degrees when extending his elbow, but after moving the elbow he could fully straighten it. The washer that was part of the hardware was also removed safely. The wound was washed and closed with #2‑0 Vicryl and #4‑0 Monocryl sutures. Marcaine was injected into the wound. The wound was covered with Steri‑Strips, Xeroform, a 4 × 4 dressing, and a bias bandage. The boy tolerated the surgery well and was taken to recovery in stable condition.  \n\n**Discharge note:**  \nThe boy will leave the hospital on the day of surgery. He should have a wound check in one week, which can be done at his primary care doctor’s office. Keep the dressing on the wound for about 4‑5 days. After that, you can wet the wound but do not scrub it. He can return to normal activities in about 2 weeks. He was given Tylenol with Codeine 10 mL by mouth every 3‑4 hours as needed for pain."
