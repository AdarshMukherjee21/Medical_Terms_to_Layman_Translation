  "medical": "EXAM: CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO Contrast REASON FOR EXAM: Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. TECHNIQUE: 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement. No oral or rectal contrast was utilized. Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05. There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP. Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips. The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen. There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak. Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either. No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present. The findings are unchanged from the prior exam. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present. There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney. No hydronephrosis is present. No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. The lung bases are clear. Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified. There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement. There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis. The bladder grossly appears normal. A hysterectomy has been performed. IMPRESSION: 1. No complications identified regarding endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair as described. The findings are stable compared to the study of 10/20/04. 2. Stable mild aneurysm of aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at renal artery level. 3. No other acute findings noted. 4. Advanced left renal atrophy.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast  \n**Reason for exam:** After a repair of an aortic and iliac artery graft.  \n\n**Technique:** A 5‑mm spiral CT scan was done of the whole abdomen and pelvis using an IV contrast injection. No oral or rectal contrast was used. The images were compared with a previous CT from 10/20/05.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The abdominal aortic aneurysm (the bulge in the aorta) has not changed in size. It is about 3.7 cm wide and 3.4 cm front‑to‑back at the level of the kidney arteries.  \n- Just below that is the top of the graft that was placed inside the aorta, with many surgical clips around it. The part of the aneurysm that is still outside the graft is 5.5 cm in diameter and has a layer of clot around the graft. No contrast has leaked into this clot, so there is no leak inside the graft.  \n- The graft extends into both common iliac arteries and there is no leak there either. No leak is seen outside the graft at any level.  \n- There is no hidden bleeding behind the abdominal organs.  \n- The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney look normal. The pancreas is somewhat shrunken throughout. The left kidney is severely shrunken. Neither kidney shows swelling from urine backup.  \n- No other acute problems are seen in the abdomen.  \n- The lower lung areas are clear.  \n- In the pelvis, nothing urgent is seen. A left hip replacement causes some streaky artifacts on the images. The sigmoid colon has moderate diverticulosis (small pouches) but no signs of inflammation. The bladder looks normal. The uterus has been removed (hysterectomy).  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. The aortoiliac graft repair is doing well with no complications.  \n2. The mild aortic aneurysm at the kidney level remains stable.  \n3. No other urgent findings.  \n4. The left kidney is severely shrunken."
