  "medical": "INTERPRETATION: MRI of the cervical spine without contrast showed normal vertebral body height and alignment with normal cervical cord signal. At C4-C5, there were minimal uncovertebral osteophytes with mild associated right foraminal compromise. At C5-C6, there were minimal diffuse disc bulge and uncovertebral osteophytes with indentation of the anterior thecal sac, but no cord deformity or foraminal compromise. At C6-C7, there was a central disc herniation resulting in mild deformity of the anterior aspect of the cord with patent neuroforamina. MRI of the thoracic spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There was evidence of disc generation, especially anteriorly at the T5-T6 level. There was no significant central canal or foraminal compromise. Thoracic cord normal in signal morphology. MRI of the lumbar spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There is disc desiccation at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis at L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4. There was a right paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 narrowing of the right lateral recess. The transversing nerve root on the right was impinged at that level. The right foramen was mildly compromised. There was also a central disc protrusion seen at the L5-S1 level resulting in indentation of the anterior thecal sac and minimal bilateral foraminal compromise. IMPRESSION: Overall impression was mild degenerative changes present in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine without high-grade central canal or foraminal narrowing. There was narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 level and associated impingement of the transversing nerve root at that level by a disc protrusion. This was also seen on a prior study.",
  "layman": "**Interpretation**\n\nThe MRI of the neck (cervical spine) was done without contrast. The bones are the right height and straight, and the spinal cord looks normal.  \n- At the level between the 4th and 5th neck bones (C4‑C5) there are very small bony growths that slightly narrow the space on the right side.  \n- At C5‑C6 there is a small, spread‑out bulge of the disc and small bony growths that press a little on the front of the protective sac around the cord, but the cord itself is not bent and the nerve openings are not narrowed.  \n- At C6‑C7 there is a central disc bulge that gently pushes on the front of the cord, but the nerve openings stay open.\n\nThe MRI of the upper back (thoracic spine) shows normal bone height and alignment. There is some disc wear, especially between the 5th and 6th thoracic bones (T5‑T6). The central canal and nerve openings are not significantly narrowed, and the spinal cord looks normal.\n\nThe MRI of the lower back (lumbar spine) shows normal bone height and alignment. The discs at L4‑L5 and L5‑S1 are dry, but there is no major narrowing of the central canal or nerve openings at L1‑L2, L2‑L3, or L3‑L4.  \n- At L4‑L5 there is a disc bulge on the right side that narrows the right side of the spinal canal and presses on the nerve root that runs through that area. The right nerve opening is slightly narrowed.  \n- At L5‑S1 there is a central disc bulge that presses on the front of the protective sac and slightly narrows the nerve openings on both sides.\n\n**Impression**\n\nOverall, there are mild age‑related changes in the neck, upper back, and lower back. None of the changes cause severe narrowing of the central canal or nerve openings. The main issue is a narrowed right side of the spinal canal at L4‑L5, where a disc bulge is pressing on the nerve root. This finding was also present on a previous study."
