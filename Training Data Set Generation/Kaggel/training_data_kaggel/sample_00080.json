  "medical": "This is a 22-year-old pregnant female. GENERAL EVALUATION: Fetal Cardiac Activity: Normal at 140 BPM Fetal Position: Variable Placenta: Posterior without evidence of placenta previa. Uterus: Normal Cervix: Closed. Adnexa: Not seen Amniotic Fluid: Within normal limits. BIOMETRY: BPD: 3.5cm consistent with 16 weeks, 6 days gestation HC: 12.0cm consistent with 16 weeks, 4 days AC: 11.2cm consistent with 17 weeks, 0 days FL: 2.2cm consistent with 16 weeks, 4 days CI (BPD/OFD): (70-86) 86 FL/HC: (19.2-20.8) 17.1 HC/AC: (1.05-1.21) 1.5 GESTATIONAL AGE BY CURRENT ULTRASOUND: 16 weeks 5 days (+/-) 1 week 1 day variability. EDD BY CURRENT ULTRASOUND: 10-31-07 FETAL ANATOMY: No gross abnormality but limited by the early age of the fetus. IMPRESSION: Single viable intrauterine pregnancy with an estimated gestational age of 16 weeks, 5 days (+/-) 1 week, 1 day variability. No visualized fetal abnormalities. However, fetal anatomy is limited by the early age of the fetus and followup is recommended at 22-24 weeks. EDD by ultrasound measurements: 10-31-2007.",
  "layman": "This is a 22‑year‑old woman who is pregnant.  \n**General exam:**  \n- The baby’s heart is beating normally at 140 beats per minute.  \n- The baby’s position in the womb is changing.  \n- The placenta is behind the uterus and there is no sign of placenta previa.  \n- The uterus looks normal.  \n- The cervix is closed.  \n- The ovaries and fallopian tubes were not seen.  \n- The amount of amniotic fluid is normal.  \n\n**Measurements (biometry):**  \n- Biparietal diameter (BPD): 3.5 cm → about 16 weeks 6 days.  \n- Head circumference (HC): 12.0 cm → about 16 weeks 4 days.  \n- Abdominal circumference (AC): 11.2 cm → about 17 weeks 0 days.  \n- Femur length (FL): 2.2 cm → about 16 weeks 4 days.  \n\n**Other ratios:**  \n- BPD/OFD: 70‑86 (measured 86).  \n- FL/HC: 19.2‑20.8 (measured 17.1).  \n- HC/AC: 1.05‑1.21 (measured 1.5).  \n\n**Estimated gestational age (by ultrasound):** 16 weeks 5 days ± 1 week 1 day.  \n**Estimated due date (by ultrasound):** October 31, 2007.  \n\n**Fetal anatomy:** No obvious problems were seen, but the baby is still very early, so the view is limited.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe pregnancy is a single, viable baby in the uterus. The estimated age is about 16 weeks 5 days, give or take a week. No fetal abnormalities were seen. Because the baby is still early, another scan is recommended between 22‑24 weeks. The due date from the ultrasound is October 31, 2007."
