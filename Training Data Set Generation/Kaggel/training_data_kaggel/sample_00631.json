  "medical": "CC: Paraplegia. HX: This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time. On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb. She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with &quot;pins & needles&quot; sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g. On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal&lt;1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued. On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These titers were not known when she initially arrived at UIHC. Following administration of Praziquantel, she regained some sensation in BLE but the paraplegia, and urinary retention remained. MEDS: On 5/24/97 UIHC arrival: Prednisone 60mg qd, Zantac 50 IV qd, Propulsid 20mg tid, Enoxaparin 20mg qd. PMH: 1)G4P4. FHX: unremarkable. SHX: Missionary. Married. 4 children ( ages 7,5,3,6 weeks). EXAM: BP110/70, HR72, RR16, 35.6C MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Lucid thought process. CN: unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE strength. Lower extremities: 1/1 quads and hamstrings, 0/0 distally. Sensory: Decreased PP/LT/VIB from feet to inguinal regions, bilaterally. T12 sensory level to temperature (ice glove). Coord: normal FNF. Station/Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE. 0/0 BLE. No plantar responses, bilaterally. Rectal: decreased to no rectal tone. Guaiac negative. Other: No Lhermitte's sign. No paraspinal hypertonicity noted. No vertebral tenderness. Gen exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: MRI T-L-spine, 5/24/97, revealed a 6 x 8 x 25 soft tissue mass at the L1 level posterior to the tip of the conus medullaris and extending into the canal below that level. This appeared to be intradural. There was mild enhancement. There was more enhancement along the distal cord surface and cauda equina. The distal cord had sign of diffuse edema. She underwent exploratory and decompressive laminectomy on 5/27/97, and was retreated with a one day course of Praziquantel 40mg/kg/day. Praziquantel is reportedly only 80% effective at parasite eradication. She continued to reside on the Neurology/Neurosurgical service on 5/31/97 and remained paraplegic.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** paralysis of both legs.  \n\n**History of present illness:**  \nA 32‑year‑old right‑handed woman who had been working as a missionary in Jos, Nigeria, delivered her fourth baby by vaginal birth on April 10, 1997. The delivery was assisted with a drug called Pitocin, but otherwise there were no problems. For the first four days after giving birth she had clear, watery diarrhea without blood and mild stomach discomfort. The diarrhea stopped on its own without treatment.  \n\nIn the second week after delivery she had 4–5 days of sinusitis with thick nasal discharge and facial pain. She felt fine until May 4, 1997, when she was moved to a more rural area of Nigeria. On that day she noticed a dull ache in both knees, just outside the kneecaps and in the upper part of the shin bones, on both sides. Massage did not help and the pain was worse when she was sitting or lying down. At that time she had no loss of feeling.  \n\nOn May 6, 1997 she woke up with pain that started in her knees and spread down to the front of her shins. Within a few hours the pain went around both calves, reached the soles of her feet and went up the back of her legs to her buttocks. Getting out of bed was very hard and she needed help to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen helped only a little. By that evening the sole of one foot was numb. The next morning, May 9, she had a “pins and needles” feeling in both legs up to her buttocks. She was given a pain medicine called Darvocet and flew back to the larger city where she was based. During the one‑hour flight her weakness in both legs progressed to the point where she could not stand. A local doctor found that her arm strength was normal (3/3 in the upper arms and 4/4 in the hands) but her leg strength was weak (0/0). She had a loss of feeling that stopped at the waist level on pinprick and light touch tests. She also had mild lower back pain. Blood tests showed a white‑blood‑cell count of 12.7 and an ESR of 10. She was thought to have Guillain‑Barré syndrome and was started on a steroid injection (Solu‑Cortef 1000 mg once a day) and intravenous immune globulin (Sandimmune IV IgG 12 g). On May 10, 1997 she was air‑lifted to Geneva, Switzerland.  \n\nWhen she arrived there she had no feeling from her feet up to the groin on both sides. Her legs were flaccid and she could not move them. She could not urinate or have a bowel movement. A straight catheter was used to empty her bladder and a large amount of urine (1000 cc) remained. On May 12, a spinal fluid test (CSF) showed high protein (1.5 g/l), low glucose (2.2 mmol/l), 92 white cells (all lymphocytes), 70 red cells, clear fluid, and no bacteria or fungi. She was started on broad‑spectrum antibiotics and a steroid injection (Solu‑Medrol 1 g once a day). An MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine on May 12 showed a small intradural lesion at T12‑L1 that barely took up contrast and was associated with swelling of the spinal cord. An MRI of the brain was normal and did not show any demyelinating disease. Tests for HIV, HTLV‑1, HSV, Lyme disease, EBV, malaria and CMV were all negative. On May 15 the test for Schistosomiasis mekongi (a parasite) was positive at a titer of 1:320 (normal < 1:80). CSF tests for the parasite on May 12 were negative. She was given a one‑day course of the anti‑parasite drug Praziquantel (3.6 g total in 3 doses) and started on Prednisone 60 mg by mouth once a day. The antibiotics and steroid injection were stopped.  \n\nOn May 22 a rectal biopsy was done to check if the parasite was gone. It was still positive for eggs and granulomas, but the exact species was not identified. CSF tests on May 22 were still positive for the parasite. After taking Praziquantel she had some return of feeling in her legs but she remained paralyzed and could not urinate.  \n\n**Hospital course at UIHC (May 24, 1997):**  \nShe was on Prednisone 60 mg daily, Zantac 50 mg IV once a day, Propulsid 20 mg three times a day, and Enoxaparin 20 mg once a day. Past medical history: four pregnancies and four births. Family history unremarkable. Married with four children (ages 7, 5, 3, and 6 weeks).  \n\nPhysical exam: blood pressure 110/70, heart rate 72, breathing 16, temperature 35.6 °C. Alert and oriented. Speech fluent. Cranial nerves normal. Upper‑extremity strength 5/5. Lower‑extremity strength 1/1 in the quadriceps and hamstrings, but 0/0 in the lower legs. Decreased pinprick, light touch and vibration sensation from the feet to the groin on both sides. Sensation to temperature stopped at the T12 level. Finger‑to‑nose coordination normal. Reflexes 2/2 in the arms, 0/0 in the legs. No plantar reflexes. Rectal tone decreased to none. Fecal occult blood test negative. No Lhermitte’s sign, no back stiffness, no vertebral tenderness. Genital exam normal.  \n\nMRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine on May 24 showed a 6 × 8 × 25 mm soft‑tissue mass at the L1 level behind the tip of the conus medullaris and extending into the canal below. It was intradural, had mild contrast uptake, and there was more uptake along the lower part of the spinal cord and the nerve roots. The lower part of the cord had diffuse swelling.  \n\nShe had surgery on May 27, a laminectomy to relieve pressure, and was given another one‑day course of Praziquantel (40 mg/kg/day). Praziquantel is only about 80 % effective at killing the parasite. She stayed on the neurology and neurosurgery service on May 31 and remained paralyzed."
