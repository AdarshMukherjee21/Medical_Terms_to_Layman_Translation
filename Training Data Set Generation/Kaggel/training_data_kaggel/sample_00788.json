  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: Followup for fetal growth. INTERPRETATION: Real-time exam demonstrates a single intrauterine fetus in cephalic presentation with a regular cardiac rate of 147 beats per minute documented. FETAL BIOMETRY: BPD = 8.3 cm = 33 weeks, 4 days HC = 30.2 cm = 33 weeks, 4 days AC = 27.9 cm = 32 weeks, 0 days FL = 6.4 cm = 33 weeks, 1 day The head to abdomen circumference ratio is normal at 1.08, and the femur length to abdomen circumference ratio is normal at 23.0%. Estimated fetal weight is 2,001 grams. The amniotic fluid volume appears normal, and the calculated index is normal for the age at 13.7 cm. A detailed fetal anatomic exam was not performed at this setting, this being a limited exam for growth. The placenta is posterofundal and grade 2. IMPRESSION: Single viable intrauterine pregnancy in cephalic presentation with a composite gestational age of 32 weeks, 5 days, plus or minus 17 days, giving and estimated date of confinement of 8/04/05. There has been normal progression of fetal growth compared to the two prior exams of 2/11/05 and 4/04/05. The examination of 4/04/05 questioned an echogenic focus within the left ventricle. The current examination does not demonstrate any significant persistent echogenic focus involving the left ventricle.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam:** Follow‑up to check how the baby is growing.  \n\n**What the scan showed:** The baby is inside the uterus, head‑down (cephalic) and has a normal heart rate of 147 beats per minute.  \n\n**Measurements (biometry):**  \n- Biparietal diameter (BPD): 8.3 cm → about 33 weeks 4 days  \n- Head circumference (HC): 30.2 cm → about 33 weeks 4 days  \n- Abdominal circumference (AC): 27.9 cm → about 32 weeks 0 days  \n- Femur length (FL): 6.4 cm → about 33 weeks 1 day  \n\nThe ratio of head to abdomen size is normal (1.08) and the ratio of femur to abdomen size is normal (23 %).  \nEstimated fetal weight: 2,001 grams.  \n\nAmniotic fluid volume is normal (index 13.7 cm for this age).  \nA full detailed anatomy scan was not done; this was a limited growth check.  \nThe placenta is located at the back of the uterus (posterofundal) and is grade 2.  \n\n**Impression:** One healthy baby in the uterus, head‑down, with a combined gestational age of about 32 weeks 5 days (± 17 days). Estimated due date is 8 April 2005. The baby’s growth has been normal compared with scans on 11 February 2005 and 4 April 2005. The earlier scan on 4 April noted a bright spot in the left ventricle of the heart, but the current scan does not show any significant persistent bright spot there."
