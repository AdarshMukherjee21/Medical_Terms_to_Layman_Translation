  "medical": "OPERATION PERFORMED: Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint. Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field. Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium. An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint. Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon. The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid. The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit. Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision. The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures. Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound. The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal. A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration. The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position. The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor. Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect. The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures. Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire. The pin was cut at the level of the skin. All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Sterile dressings were then applied. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "**Operation performed:**  \nReconstruction of the wrist ligament and replacement of the joint with a tendon in the right wrist.\n\n**Procedure description:**  \nThe patient was given enough anesthesia and the right arm was cleaned and covered with sterile cloth. The surgeon worked at the base of the thumb, making a long cut over the snuffbox (the small hollow at the thumb’s base) and extending it to the joint where the thumb meets the wrist bones.  \n\nUsing gentle tissue separation, the surgeon moved the radial sensory nerve out of the way. More gentle separation exposed the radial artery, which was also moved aside from the trapezium bone. A cut was then made across the joint between the scaphoid and trapezium bones, reaching the trapezium and the thumb‑wrist joint. Sharp cutting revealed the trapezium bone, which was carefully broken into small pieces and removed, taking care not to damage the nearby flexor carpi radialis (FCR) tendon.  \n\nThe part of the trapezoid bone that attaches to the scaphoid was cut away. The top part of the thumb bone (proximal metacarpal) was drilled with a 4.5‑mm bit to create a hole. A small cut was made a few fingers above the wrist crease to access the FCR tendon. The tendon was gently pulled into this cut, cut in half, and the cut was closed with 4‑0 nylon stitches.  \n\nThe surgeon then pulled the FCR tendon into the trapezial wound. The tendon was threaded through the hole in the thumb bone. A bone anchor was placed just below the hole. The tendon was pulled down, bringing the thumb bone back into its normal position. The tendon was sewn to the bone with the anchor. The remaining part of the tendon was anchored and placed into the space left by the removed trapezium and scaphoid.  \n\nThe thumb joint was moved into extension and the joint capsule was closed with interrupted 3‑0 Tycron stitches. The thumb joint was then positioned at 15° of flexion and held in place with a single 0.035‑mm Kirschner wire (a small metal pin). The pin was cut flush with the skin. All skin cuts were closed with a running 3‑0 Prolene stitch under the skin. Sterile dressings were applied. The tourniquet was released. The patient woke up from anesthesia and was sent to recovery in good condition, having tolerated the surgery well."
