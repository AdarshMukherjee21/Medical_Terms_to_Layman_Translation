  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory dyspepsia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Hiatal hernia. 2. Reflux esophagitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with pseudo and esophageal biopsy. ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed. SPECIMEN: Esophageal biopsy. COMPLICATIONS: None. HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old female morbidly obese black female who has a long history of reflux and GERD type symptoms including complications such as hoarseness and chronic cough. She has been on multiple medical regimens and continues with dyspeptic symptoms. PROCEDURE: After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated. At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present. There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis. The scope was then passed into the stomach. It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum. The pylorus was patent. There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum. The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation. The scope was then brought back into the antrum. A retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized. The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn. There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body. Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken. The scope was then completely withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. She will return to the General Medical Floor. We will continue b.i.d proton-pump inhibitor therapy as well as dietary restrictions. She should also attempt significant weight loss.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Persistent stomach discomfort (dyspepsia).  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** 1. Hiatal hernia. 2. Reflux esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus from stomach acid).  \n\n**Procedure performed:** An upper endoscopy (scope inserted through the mouth to look at the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine) with a small tissue sample taken from the esophagus.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** Light sedation with Demerol and Versed.  \n\n**Specimen:** Esophageal biopsy.  \n\n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**History:** The patient is a 52‑year‑old black woman who is severely obese. She has had long‑standing reflux and GERD‑like symptoms, including hoarseness and a chronic cough. She has tried many medications but still has stomach discomfort.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter the patient gave informed consent, she was taken to the endoscopy room. She lay on her left side and received IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. Once she was calm enough, the scope was gently passed through her mouth into her throat and esophagus. At the junction where the esophagus meets the stomach, a hiatal hernia was seen. Mild inflammation consistent with reflux esophagitis was also present. The scope was then moved into the stomach, where the stomach was inflated with air and the scope was guided along the outer curve to the lower part of the stomach (the antrum). The opening to the small intestine (pylorus) was open. Bile reflux was seen in the antrum. The first part of the small intestine (duodenal bulb) was examined and showed no masses, ulcers, or inflammation. The scope was then pulled back into the antrum. Attempts to look backward (retroflexion) were made several times, but the patient could not hold enough air to get a clear view. The scope was then slowly withdrawn. No other problems were seen in the upper stomach (fundus) or middle stomach (body). At the esophagus‑stomach junction, a biopsy was taken. The scope was then removed completely.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was moved to the recovery area in stable condition. She will be sent to the general medical floor. We will keep her on twice‑daily proton‑pump inhibitor medication and recommend dietary restrictions. She should also try to lose a significant amount of weight."
