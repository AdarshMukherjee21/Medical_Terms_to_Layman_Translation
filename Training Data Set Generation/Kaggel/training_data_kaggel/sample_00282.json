  "medical": "PROCEDURE: EEG during wakefulness demonstrates background activity consisting of moderate-amplitude beta activity seen bilaterally. The EEG background is symmetric. Independent, small, positive, sharp wave activity is seen in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally with sharp-slow wave discharges seen more predominantly in the right frontotemporal head region. No clinical signs of involuntary movements are noted during synchronous video monitoring. Recording time is 22 minutes and 22 seconds. There is attenuation of the background, faster activity during drowsiness and some light sleep is recorded. No sustained epileptogenic activity is evident, but the independent bilateral sharp wave activity is seen intermittently. Photic stimulation induced a bilaterally symmetric photic driving response. IMPRESSION: EEG during wakefulness and light sleep is abnormal with independent, positive sharp wave activity seen in both frontotemporal head regions, more predominant in the right frontotemporal region. The EEG findings are consistent with potentially epileptogenic process. Clinical correlation is warranted.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:**  \nAn EEG was done while the patient was awake. It showed normal‑looking background brain waves that were the same on both sides of the head. However, small, sharp spikes appeared on both sides of the front‑temporal area, especially on the right side. No involuntary movements were seen on the video that ran at the same time. The recording lasted 22 minutes and 22 seconds. When the patient became drowsy or entered light sleep, the background waves slowed and became less strong. No long‑lasting seizure activity was seen, but the sharp spikes appeared intermittently. When lights were flashed, the brain responded in a symmetrical way on both sides.\n\n**Impression:**  \nThe EEG during wakefulness and light sleep is abnormal. It shows independent, sharp spikes in both front‑temporal areas, more on the right. These findings suggest a possible seizure‑related problem. A clinical evaluation is needed to understand the significance."
