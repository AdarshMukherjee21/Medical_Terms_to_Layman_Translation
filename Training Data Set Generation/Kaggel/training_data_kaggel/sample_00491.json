  "medical": "INDICATIONS: Dysphagia. PREMEDICATION: Topical Cetacaine spray and Versed IV. PROCEDURE:: The scope was passed into the esophagus under direct vision. The esophageal mucosa was all unremarkable. There was no evidence of any narrowing present anywhere throughout the esophagus and no evidence of esophagitis. The scope was passed on down into the stomach. The gastric mucosa was all examined including a retroflexed view of the fundus and there were no abnormalities seen. The scope was then passed into the duodenum and the duodenal bulb and second and third portions of the duodenum were unremarkable. The scope was again slowly withdrawn through the esophagus and no evidence of narrowing was present. The scope was then withdrawn. IMPRESSION: Normal upper GI endoscopy without any evidence of anatomical narrowing.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the procedure:** Trouble swallowing.\n\n**Before the procedure:** A local numbing spray (Cetacaine) and an IV sedative (Versed) were used.\n\n**What was done:**  \nThe doctor inserted a flexible tube with a camera (scope) into the esophagus while watching it on a screen. The lining of the esophagus looked normal, with no narrowing or inflammation. The scope was then guided into the stomach. The stomach lining, including a view of the upper part (fundus), was examined and appeared normal. Next, the scope was moved into the small intestine (duodenum). The first, second, and third parts of the duodenum were all normal. The scope was carefully pulled back through the esophagus, again showing no narrowing. Finally, the scope was removed.\n\n**Result:** The upper gastrointestinal tract looked normal, with no signs of narrowing or other problems."
