  "medical": "X Y, MD City, State Dear Dr. Y: I had the pleasure of seeing ABC today back in Neurology Clinic where he has been followed previously by Dr. Z. His last visit was in June 2006, and he carries a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy. To review, his birth was unremarkable. He is a second child born to a G3, P1 to 2 female. He has had normal development, and is a bright child in 7th grade. He began having seizures, however, at 9 years of age. It is manifested typically as generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening or falling into sleep. He also had smaller spells with more focal convulsion and facial twitching. His EEGs have shown a pattern consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy (central temporal sharp waves both of the right and left hemisphere). Most recent EEG in May 2006 shows the same abnormalities. ABC initially was placed on Tegretol, but developed symptoms of toxicity (hallucinations) on this medication, he was switched to Trileptal. He has done very well taking 300 mg twice a day without any further seizures. His last event was the day of his last EEG when he was sleep deprived and was off medication. That was a convulsion lasting 5 minutes. He has done well otherwise. Parents deny that he has any problems with concentration. He has not had any behavior issues. He is an active child and participates in sports and some motocross activities. He has one older sibling and he lives with his parents. Father manages Turkey farm with foster farms. Mother is an 8th grade teacher. Family history is positive for a 3rd cousin, who has seizures, but the specific seizure type is not known. There is no other relevant family history. Review of systems is positive for right heel swelling and tenderness to palpation. This is perhaps due to sports injury. He has not sprained his ankle and does not have any specific acute injury around the time that this was noted. He does also have some discomfort in the knees and ankles in the general sense with activities. He has no rashes or any numbness, weakness or loss of skills. He has no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. He has no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal complaints. Past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Other workup includes CT scan and MRI scan of the brain, which are both normal. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: His weight today is 80.6 pounds. Height is 58-1/4 inches. Blood pressure 113/66. Head circumference 36.3 cm. HEENT: Atraumatic, normocephalic. Oropharynx shows no lesions. NECK: Supple without adenopathy. CHEST: Clear auscultation. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. ABDOMEN: Benign without organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and oriented. His cognitive skills appear normal for his age. His speech is fluent and goal-directed. He follows instructions well. His cranial nerves reveal his pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Visual fields are full. Disks are sharp bilaterally. Face moves symmetrically with normal sensation. Palate elevates midline. Tongue protrudes midline. Hearing is intact bilaterally. Motor exam reveals normal strength and tone. Sensation intact to light touch and vibration. His gait is nonataxic with normal heel-toe and tandem. Finger-to-nose, finger-nose-finger, rapid altering movements are normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. IMPRESSION: This is an 11-year-old male with benign rolandic epilepsy, who is followed over the past 2 years in our clinic. Most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities, but it has not been done since May 2006. The plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram, follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal. At that time, he will be tapered off of medication. I anticipate at some point in the near future, within about a year or so, he will actually be taken off medication. For now, I will continue on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose for him. There is no indication that his dose needs to be increased. Family understands the plan. We will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in Modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months. Parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results. Thank you very much for allowing me to access ABC for further management.",

His last visit was in June 2006, and he has a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy.  \n\nTo review, ABC was born without any complications. He is the second child of a mother who has had three pregnancies and one live birth. He has had normal development and is a bright 7th‑grade student. He began having seizures at age 9. The seizures usually start when he wakes up or falls asleep and are generalized tonic‑clonic. He also has had smaller episodes with focal convulsions and facial twitching. EEGs show a pattern typical of benign rolandic epilepsy, with sharp waves in the central temporal area of both hemispheres. The most recent EEG in May 2006 shows the same abnormalities.  \n\nABC was first started on Tegretol, but he developed hallucinations, so we switched him to Trileptal. He has done very well on 300 mg twice a day and has had no further seizures. The last event occurred on the day of his last EEG when he was sleep‑deprived and off medication; it was a 5‑minute convulsion. Otherwise he has done well. His parents say he has no concentration problems and no behavior issues. He is an active child who plays sports and does motocross. He has one older sibling and lives with his parents. His father runs a turkey farm with foster farms, and his mother teaches 8th grade. A third‑cousin in the family has seizures, but the type is unknown. No other family history is relevant.  \n\n**Review of systems**  \n- Right heel swelling and tenderness, probably from a sports injury.  \n- No ankle sprain and no other acute injury.  \n- Some discomfort in knees and ankles during activity.  \n- No rashes, numbness, weakness, or loss of skills.  \n- No breathing or heart problems.  \n- No stomach upset (no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal complaints).  \n\nPast medical history is otherwise normal.

Speech fluent and goal‑directed. Follows instructions well. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Visual fields full. Visual acuity sharp. Face symmetrical with normal sensation. Palate midline. Tongue midline. Hearing normal. Motor strength and tone normal. Sensation to light touch and vibration intact. Gait normal, heel‑to‑toe and tandem walking fine. Finger‑to‑nose, rapid alternating movements normal. Deep tendon reflexes 2+ and symmetrical.  \n\n**Impression**  \nABC is an 11‑year‑old boy with benign rolandic epilepsy who has been followed in our clinic for the past two years. His most recent EEG still shows abnormalities, but it has not been repeated since May 2006. The plan is to repeat the EEG and follow it annually until it returns to normal. At that point we will taper his medication. We expect he may be able to stop medication within about a year. For now we will keep him on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose. There is no indication to increase the dose. The family understands the plan. We will try to obtain an EEG in Modesto soon and schedule a follow‑up in six months. The parents will contact us after the EEG to get the results.  \n\nThank you for allowing me to manage ABC’s care.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Name]"
