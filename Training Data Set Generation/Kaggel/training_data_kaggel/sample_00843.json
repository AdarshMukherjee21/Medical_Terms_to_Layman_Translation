ANESTHESIA: Local MAC. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given antibiotics preop. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old male who presented to us with significant phimosis, difficulty retracting the foreskin. The patient had buried penis with significant obesity issues in the suprapubic area. Options such as watchful waiting, continuation of slowly retracting the skin, applying betamethasone cream, and circumcision were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, and CVA risks were discussed. The patient had discussed this issue with Dr Khan and had been approved to get off of the Plavix. Consent had been obtained. Risk of scarring, decrease in penile sensation, and unexpected complications were discussed. The patient was told about removing the dressing tomorrow morning, okay to shower after 48 hours, etc. Consent was obtained. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in supine position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Local MAC anesthesia was applied. After draping, 17 mL of mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain were applied around the dorsal aspect of the penis for dorsal block. The patient had significant phimosis and slight ventral chordee. Using marking pen, the excess foreskin was marked off. Using a knife, the ventral chordee was released. The urethra was intact. The excess foreskin was removed. Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery. A 5-0 Monocryl stitches were used for 4 interrupted stitches and horizontal mattresses were done. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There was excellent hemostasis. The penis was straight. Vaseline gauze and Kerlix were applied. The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition.

He also had a buried penis and was noticeably overweight around the belly area. We talked about several options: waiting, slowly trying to pull the skin back, using a steroid cream (betamethasone), or having a circumcision. We explained the risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, heart attack, blood clots, and stroke. The patient had already discussed this with Dr. Khan and had stopped taking Plavix. He gave his consent. We also discussed possible scarring, reduced sensation, and other complications. He was told the dressing would be removed tomorrow morning and that he could shower after 48 hours. Consent was obtained.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room. He was given local anesthesia and placed on his back. The area was cleaned and covered in a sterile way. A local block was given by injecting 17 mL of a mix of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine around the top of the penis. The tight foreskin and a slight bend on the underside were noted. With a pen, the excess foreskin was marked. A knife was used to cut the excess skin and to release the bend. The urethra was intact. The excess skin was removed. Bleeding was stopped with electrocautery. Four 5‑0 Monocryl stitches were placed as interrupted stitches, and horizontal mattress stitches were added. The patient tolerated the surgery well, with good control of bleeding. The penis was straight. Vaseline gauze and Kerlix were applied. The patient was moved to recovery in stable condition. The plan is to remove the dressing tomorrow and to shower after 48 hours."
