  "medical": "EXAM: CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO Contrast REASON FOR EXAM: Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. TECHNIQUE: 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement. No oral or rectal contrast was utilized. Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05. There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP. Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips. The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen. There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak. Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either. No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present. The findings are unchanged from the prior exam. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present. There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney. No hydronephrosis is present. No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. The lung bases are clear. Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified. There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement. There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis. The bladder grossly appears normal. A hysterectomy has been performed. IMPRESSION: 1. No complications identified regarding endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair as described. The findings are stable compared to the study of 10/20/04. 2. Stable mild aneurysm of aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at renal artery level. 3. No other acute findings noted. 4. Advanced left renal atrophy.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast  \n**Reason for exam:** After having a repair of the aorta and iliac arteries.  \n\n**Technique:** A 5‑mm spiral CT scan was done through the whole abdomen and pelvis while a contrast dye was injected into a vein. No oral or rectal contrast was used. The images were compared with a previous CT from 10/20/05.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The abdominal aortic aneurysm (the bulging part of the aorta) has not changed in size. It is about 3.7 cm wide and 3.4 cm front‑to‑back, located near where the renal arteries start.  \n- Just below that, the endoluminal graft (the internal tube placed inside the aorta) is in place and has many surgical clips around it. The part of the aneurysm that remains outside the graft is still about 5.5 cm wide and has a clot lining the inside of the graft. No contrast dye has leaked into the clot, indicating no leak inside the graft.  \n- The graft extends into both common iliac arteries and shows no leak there either. No leak is seen outside the graft at any level.  \n- There is no collection of blood (hematoma) behind the abdominal organs.  \n- The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney look normal. The pancreas shows moderate overall shrinkage. The left kidney is severely shrunk. No swelling of the kidneys (hydronephrosis) is seen. No other acute problems are found in the abdomen.  \n- The lower parts of the lungs are clear.  \n- In the pelvis, nothing urgent is seen. A streaky artifact is present from a left hip replacement. The sigmoid colon has moderate diverticulosis (small pouches) but no inflammation (diverticulitis). The bladder looks normal. The uterus has been removed (hysterectomy).  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. No complications with the aortoiliac graft; the situation is the same as the 10/20/04 study.  \n2. The mild aortic aneurysm near the renal artery level remains stable.  \n3. No other new acute problems.  \n4. The left kidney is severely atrophied."
