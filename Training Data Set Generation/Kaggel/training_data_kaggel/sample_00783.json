  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of bladder tumor with abnormal cytology and areas of erythema. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of bladder tumor with abnormal cytology and areas of erythema. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystoscopy. 2. Bladder biopsy with fulguration. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local. SPECIMEN: Urine cytology and right lateral wall biopsies. PROCEDURE: After the consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and given IV sedation. He was then placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then used to visualized the entire urethra and bladder. There was noted to be a narrowing of the proximal urethra, however, the scope was able to pass through. The patient was noted to have a previously resected prostate. On visualization of the bladder, the patient did have areas of erythema on the right as well as the left lateral walls, more significant on the right side. The patient did have increased vascularity throughout the bladder. The ________ two biopsies of the right lateral wall and those were sent for pathology. The Bovie cautery was then used to cauterize the entire area of the biopsy as well as surrounding erythema. Bovie was also utilized to cauterize the areas of erythema on the left lateral wall. No further bleeding was identified. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room. He will have his defibrillator restarted and will followup with Dr. X in approximately two weeks for the result. He will be discharged home with antibiotics as well as pain medications. He is to restart his Coumadin not before Sunday.",

Cystoscopy (looking inside the bladder).  \n2. Bladder biopsy and cauterization (burning to stop bleeding).  \n\nANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local anesthesia.  \n\nSPECIMEN: Urine test for abnormal cells and two biopsies from the right side of the bladder wall.  \n\nPROCEDURE:  \nAfter the patient gave consent, he was taken to the operating room and given IV sedation. He was positioned on his back with legs raised (dorsal lithotomy) and the area was cleaned and covered. A #21 French cystoscope was inserted to look at the urethra and bladder. The urethra was a bit narrowed at the front, but the scope could pass through. The patient had a prostate that had been removed before. Inside the bladder, there were red spots on both the right and left walls, especially on the right. The bladder also had more blood vessels than usual. Two biopsies were taken from the right wall and sent for analysis. A cautery device (Bovie) was used to burn the biopsy sites and the surrounding red spots. The same device was used on the left wall’s red spots. No more bleeding was seen. The bladder was drained and the scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was moved to the recovery room. He will have his defibrillator turned back on and will see Dr. X in about two weeks for the results. He will be sent home with antibiotics and pain medicine. He should not restart his Coumadin until Sunday."
