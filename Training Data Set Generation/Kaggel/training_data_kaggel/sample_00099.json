  "medical": "EXAM: Transesophageal echocardiogram and direct current cardioversion. REASON FOR EXAM: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. 2. Shortness of breath. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was then sedated using a total of 4 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl. Following this, transesophageal probe was placed in the esophagus. Transesophageal views of the heart were then obtained. FINDINGS: 1. Left ventricle is of normal size. Overall LV systolic function is preserved. Estimated ejection fraction is 60% to 65%. No wall motion abnormalities are noted. 2. Left atrium is dilated. 3. Left atrial appendage is free of clots. 4. Right atrium is of normal size. 5. Right ventricle is of normal size. 6. Mitral valve shows evidence of mild MAC. 7. Aortic valve is sclerotic without significant restriction of leaflet motion. 8. Tricuspid valve appears normal. 9. Pulmonic valve appears normal. 10. Pacer wires are noted in the right atrium and in the right ventricle. 11. Doppler interrogation of moderate mitral regurgitation is present. 12. Mild-to-moderate AI is seen. 13. No significant TR is noted. 14. No significant TI is noted. 15. No pericardial disease seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Preserved left ventricular systolic function. 2. Dilated left atrium. 3. Moderate mitral regurgitation. 4. Aortic valve sclerosis with mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency. 5. Left atrial appendage is free of clots. Following these, direct current cardioversion was performed. Three biphasic shock waves of 150 and two of 200 joules were then applied to the patient's chest in anteroposterior direction without success in conversion to sinus rhythm. The patient remained in atrial fibrillation. PLAN: Plan will be to continue medical therapy. We will consider using beta-blocker, calcium channel blockers for better ventricular rate control.",

Shortness of breath.  \n\nPROCEDURE: After the patient agreed, they were given 4 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl to sedate them. A TEE probe was then inserted into the esophagus to view the heart.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n1. The left ventricle is normal in size and works well. Its ejection fraction is about 60‑65 %. No abnormal wall motion was seen.  \n2. The left atrium is enlarged.  \n3. The left atrial appendage has no clots.  \n4. The right atrium is normal in size.  \n5. The right ventricle is normal in size.  \n6. The mitral valve shows mild calcification (MAC).  \n7. The aortic valve is stiff but the leaflets move enough.  \n8. The tricuspid valve looks normal.  \n9. The pulmonic valve looks normal.  \n10. Pacer wires are present in the right atrium and right ventricle.  \n11. Doppler shows moderate mitral regurgitation.  \n12. Mild‑to‑moderate aortic insufficiency is seen.  \n13. No significant tricuspid regurgitation.  \n14. No significant tricuspid insufficiency.  \n15. No pericardial disease.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Left ventricle is functioning well.  \n2. Left atrium is enlarged.  \n3. Moderate mitral regurgitation.  \n4. Aortic valve stiffness with mild‑to‑moderate aortic insufficiency.  \n5. No clots in the left atrial appendage.  \n\nAfter the TEE, direct current cardioversion was attempted. Three biphasic shocks of 150 J and two of 200 J were delivered from front to back of the chest, but the rhythm did not change to normal sinus. The patient stayed in atrial fibrillation.  \n\nPLAN: Continue medical treatment. We will consider adding a beta‑blocker or calcium‑channel blocker to better control the heart rate."
