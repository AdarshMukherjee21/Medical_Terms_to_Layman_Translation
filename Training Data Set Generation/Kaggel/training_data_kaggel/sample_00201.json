  "medical": "CC: Difficulty with speech. HX: This 84 y/o RHF presented with sudden onset word finding and word phonation difficulties. She had an episode of transient aphasia in 2/92 during which she had difficulty with writing, written and verbal comprehension, and exhibited numerous semantic and phonemic paraphasic errors of speech. These problems resolved within 24 hours of onset and she had no subsequent speech problems prior to this presentation. Workup at that time revealed a right to left shunt on trans-thoracic echocardiogram. Carotid doppler studies showed 0-15% BICA stenosis and a LICA aneurysm (mentioned above). Brain CT was unremarkable. She was placed on ASA after the 2/92 event. In 5/92 she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered a fractured left humerus and left occipital scalp laceration. HCT at that time showed a small area of slightly increased attenuation at the posterior right claustrum only. This was not felt to be a contusion; nevertheless, she was placed on Dilantin seizure prophylaxis. Her left arm was casted and she returned home. 5 hours prior to presentation today, the patient began having difficulty finding words and putting them into speech. She was able to comprehend speech. This continued for an hour; then partially resolved for one hour; then returned; then waxed and waned. There was no reported weakness, numbness, incontinence, seizure-like activity, incoordination, HA, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness MEDS: ASA , DPH, Tenormin, Premarin, HCTZ PMH: 1)transient fluent aphasia 2/92 (which resolved), 2)bilateral carotid endarterectomies 1986, 3)HTN, 4)distal left internal carotid artery aneurysm. EXAM: BP 168/70, Pulse 82, RR 16, 35.8F MS:A & O x 3, Difficulty following commands, Speech fluent, and without dysarthria. There were occasional phonemic paraphasic errors. CN: Unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 throughout except for 4+ right wrist extension and right knee flexion. Sensory: unremarkable. Coordination: mild left finger-nose-finger dysynergia and dysmetria. Gait: mildly unsteady tandem walk. Station: no Romberg sign. Reflexes: slightly more brisk at the left patella than on the right. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic exam and the general physical exam were unremarkable. LABS: CBC WNL, Gen Screen WNL, , PT/PTT WNL, DPH 26.2mcg/ml, CXR WNL, EKG: LBBB, HCT revealed a left subdural hematoma. COURSE: Patient was taken to surgery and the subdural hematoma was evacuated. Her mental status, language skills, improved dramatically. The DPH dosage was adjusted appropriately.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: Trouble speaking.  \n\nHistory: An 84‑year‑old woman came to the hospital because she suddenly had difficulty finding and saying words. She had a similar episode in February 1992 when she could not write or understand spoken or written language and made many speech errors. That episode went away within a day and she had no speech problems until now. At that time, a heart ultrasound showed a right‑to‑left shunt. Carotid ultrasound showed only mild narrowing of both carotid arteries and an aneurysm in the left internal carotid artery. A brain CT scan was normal. She was started on aspirin after the February 1992 event. In May 1992 she was in a car accident, breaking her left arm and getting a scalp cut. A head CT then showed a small area of slightly higher density in the back part of the right claustrum. It was not thought to be a bruise, but she was given Dilantin to prevent seizures. Her arm was casted and she went home. Five hours before today’s visit she began having trouble finding words and putting them into speech. She could still understand speech. The problem lasted an hour, then improved for an hour, then returned, and kept coming and going. She had no weakness, numbness, incontinence, seizure‑like activity, trouble coordinating, headache, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness.  \n\nMedications: aspirin, DPH, Tenormin, Premarin, HCTZ.  \n\nPast medical history: transient fluent aphasia in February 1992 (resolved), bilateral carotid endarterectomies in 1986, high blood pressure, and a distal left internal carotid artery aneurysm.  \n\nExamination: Blood pressure 168/70, pulse 82, respirations 16, temperature 35.8 °C. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. She had difficulty following commands. Her speech was fluent and she had no trouble moving her mouth. She made occasional speech errors. Cranial nerves were normal. Muscle strength was 5/5 everywhere except for slightly weaker right wrist extension and right knee flexion. Sensation was normal. Coordination showed mild left hand‑to‑nose‑hand difficulty and hand‑to‑target problems. Walking on toes was a little unsteady. No positive Romberg sign. Reflexes were a little brisker in the left knee than the right. Plantar reflexes were normal. The rest of the neurological and general physical exam was normal.  \n\nLabs: CBC normal, general screen normal, PT/PTT normal, DPH 26.2 mcg/ml, chest X‑ray normal, ECG showed left bundle branch block. A head CT showed a left subdural hematoma.  \n\nCourse: She had surgery to remove the subdural hematoma. Her mental status and language improved a lot. The DPH dose was adjusted appropriately."
