  "medical": "EXAM:MRI RIGHT ANKLE CLINICAL:This is a 51 year old female who first came into the office 3/4/05 with right ankle pain. She stepped on ice the evening prior and twisted her ankle. PF's showed no frank fracture, dislocation, or subluxations. FINDINGS: Received for interpretation is an MRI examination performed on 4/28/2005. There is a &quot;high ankle sprain&quot; of the distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex involving the anterior tibiofibular ligament with marked ligamentous inflammatory thickening and diffuse interstitial edema. There is osteoarthritic spur formation at the anterior aspect of the fibula with a small 2mm osseous structure within the markedly thickened anterior talofibular ligament suggesting a small ligamentous osseous avulsion. The distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex remains intact without a complete rupture. There is no widening of the ankle mortis. The posterior talofibular ligament remains intact. There is marked ligamentous thickening of the anterior talofibular ligament of the lateral collateral ligamentous complex suggesting the sequela of a remote lateral ankle sprain. There is thickening of the posterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. There is a flat retromalleolar sulcus. There is a full-thickness longitudinal split tear of the peroneus brevis tendon within the retromalleolar groove. The tear extends to the level of the inferior peroneal retinaculum. There is anterior displacement of the peroneus longus tendon into the split peroneus tendon tear. There is severe synovitis of the peroneus longus tendon sheath with prominent fluid distention. The synovitis extends to the level of the inferior peroneal retinaculum. There is a focal area of chondral thinning of the hyaline cartilage of the medial talar dome with a focal area of subchondral plate cancellous marrow resorption consistent with and area of prior talar dome contusion but there is no focal osteochondral impaction or osteochondral defect. There is minimal fluid within the tibiotalar articulation. There is minimal fluid within the posterior subtalar articulation with mild anterior capsular prolapse. Normal talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations. The anterior superior calcaneal process is normal. There is mild tenosynovitis of the posterior tibialis tendon sheath but an intrinsically normal tendon. There is an os navicularis (Type II synchondrosis) with an intact synchondrosis and no active marrow stress phenomenon. Normal flexor digitorum longus tendon. There is prominent fluid distention of the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath with capsular distention proximal to the posterior talar processes with prominent fluid distention of the synovial sheath. There is a loculated fluid collection within Kagers fat measuring approximately 1 x 1 x 2.5cm in size, extending to the posterior subtalar facet joint consistent with a ganglion of either posterior subtalar facet origin or arising from the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath. There is mild tenosynovitis of the Achilles tendon with mild fusiform enlargement of the non-insertional Watershed zone of the Achilles tendon but there is no demonstrated tendon tear or tenosynovitis. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 4cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon. There is no Haglunds deformity. There is a plantar calcaneal spur measuring approximately 6mm in size, without a reactive marrow stress phenomenon. Normal plantar fascia. IMPRESSION: Partial high ankle sprain with diffuse interstitial edema of the anterior tibiofibular ligament with a ligamentous chip avulsion but without a disruption of the anterior tibiofibular ligament. Marked ligamentous thickening of the lateral collateral ligamentous complex consistent with the sequela of a remote lateral ankle sprain. Full-thickness longitudinal split tear of the peroneus brevis tendon with severe synovitis of the peroneal tendon sheath. Post-traumatic deformity of the medial talar dome consistent with a prior osteochondral impaction injury but no osteochondral defect. Residual subchondral plate cancellous marrow edema. Severe synovitis of the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath with prominent fluid distention of the synovial sheath proximal to the posterior talar processes. Septated cystic structure within Kagers fat triangle extending along the superior aspect of the calcaneus consistent with a ganglion of either articular or synovial sheath origin. Plantar calcaneal spur but no reactive marrow stress phenomenon. Mild tendinosis of the Achilles tendon but no tendinitis or tendon tear. Os navicularis (Type II synchondrosis) without an active marrow stress phenomenon.",
  "layman": "**EXAM: MRI of the right ankle**\n\n**Clinical:**  \nA 51‑year‑old woman first came to the office on March 4, 2005 with pain in her right ankle. She stepped on ice the night before and twisted her ankle. X‑rays did not show a clear fracture, dislocation, or joint misalignment.\n\n**Findings:**  \nThe MRI taken on April 28, 2005 shows a “high ankle sprain.” The ligament that connects the tibia and fibula near the ankle (the anterior tibiofibular ligament) is swollen and inflamed, with fluid in the surrounding tissue.  \nThere is a bony spur on the front of the fibula and a small 2 mm bone fragment inside the thickened anterior talofibular ligament, indicating a small bone pull‑out injury.  \nThe tibiofibular ligament complex is still intact; the ankle joint is not widened. The posterior talofibular ligament is also intact.  \nThe front part of the lateral ankle ligament (anterior talofibular ligament) is thickened, showing the result of a past lateral ankle sprain. The back talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments are also thickened.  \nThe space behind the ankle bone (retromalleolar sulcus) is flat.  \nThere is a full‑thickness tear that runs lengthwise in the peroneus brevis tendon inside this groove. The tear reaches the lower peroneal retinaculum. The peroneus longus tendon has moved forward into the tear. The sheath around the peroneus longus tendon is heavily inflamed and filled with fluid, extending to the lower peroneal retinaculum.  \nThe cartilage on the inside of the talar dome (the ankle bone that meets the tibia) is thinned in one spot, and the bone underneath shows some marrow loss, indicating a past bruise of the talar dome. No new bone or cartilage damage is seen.  \nThere is a small amount of fluid in the ankle joint and a small amount in the back subtalar joint, with a slight bulge of the front joint capsule. The talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints are normal. The front part of the heel bone (anterior superior calcaneal process) is normal.  \nThe posterior tibialis tendon sheath has mild inflammation, but the tendon itself is normal.  \nThere is a normal type‑II navicular bone (os navicularis) with no active bone stress.  \nThe flexor digitorum longus tendon is normal.  \nThe sheath around the flexor hallucis longus tendon is swollen with fluid, and the capsule near the back of the talus is also swollen.  \nA fluid pocket (about 1 × 1 × 2.5 cm) is seen in the fat pad behind the heel (Kager’s fat), extending to the back subtalar joint. This is likely a ganglion cyst from either the joint or the tendon sheath.  \nThe Achilles tendon shows mild inflammation of its sheath and a slight swelling in the middle part of the tendon, but no tear or severe inflammation. The soleus muscle is low‑lying, reaching close to the Achilles tendon attachment. There is no Haglund’s deformity. A 6 mm heel spur is present on the bottom of the heel, but no bone stress is seen. The plantar fascia is normal.\n\n**Impression:**  \n- Partial high ankle sprain with swelling of the front tibiofibular ligament and a small bone pull‑out, but the ligament is not torn.  \n- Thickening of the lateral ankle ligaments from a past sprain.  \n- Full‑thickness tear of the peroneus brevis tendon with severe inflammation of its sheath.  \n- Past bruise of the medial talar dome with some bone marrow swelling, but no new bone or cartilage damage.  \n- Severe inflammation of the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath with fluid swelling near the back of the talus.  \n- A cystic fluid collection in the fat pad behind the heel, likely a ganglion.  \n- Heel spur on the bottom of the heel, no bone stress.  \n- Mild Achilles tendon inflammation, no tear.  \n- Normal type‑II navicular bone with no bone stress."
