  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation. INDICATION: The patient is a 2-year, 2-month-old little girl who presented to the hospital with severe anemia, hemoglobin 5.8, elevated total bilirubin consistent with hemolysis and weak positive direct Coombs test. She was transfused with packed red blood cells. Her hemolysis seemed to slow down. She also on presentation had indications of urinary tract infection with urinalysis significant for 2+ leukocytes, positive nitrites, 3+ protein, 3+ blood, 25 to 100 white cells, 10 to 25 bacteria, 10 to 25 epithelial cells on clean catch specimen. Culture subsequently grew out no organisms; however, the child had been pretreated with amoxicillin about x3 doses prior to presentation to the hospital. She had a blood culture, which was also negative. She was empirically started on presentation with the cefotaxime intravenously. Her white count on presentation was significantly elevated at 20,800, subsequently increased to 24.7 and then decreased to 16.6 while on antibiotics. After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present. She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI. I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures. The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression. Questions were answered to their satisfaction. They would like to proceed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After &quot;time out&quot; procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained. She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself. She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied. She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself. She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision. Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact. The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained. The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied. Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back. During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable. Of note, EMLA cream had also been applied prior procedure, this was removed prior to cleansing of the back. Fluid will be sent for a routine cell count, Gram stain culture, protein, and glucose. DISPOSITION: The child returned to room on the medical floor in satisfactory condition.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) with moderate sedation.  \n\n**Why it was done:**  \nThe patient is a 2‑year‑2‑month‑old girl who came to the hospital with very low red blood cells (hemoglobin 5.8) and signs that her red cells were breaking down (high bilirubin, weakly positive Coombs test). She was given a blood transfusion and her red‑cell breakdown slowed.  \n\nShe also had a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her urine test showed white cells, nitrites, protein, blood, and bacteria, but a later culture grew no bacteria—likely because she had taken amoxicillin before coming to the hospital. A blood culture was also negative. She was started on IV cefotaxime when she arrived.  \n\nHer white‑blood‑cell count was very high (20,800) and rose to 24,700 before dropping to 16,600 while on antibiotics. After stopping antibiotics, it spiked again to 31,000 with many immature cells. She vomited three times. Because of the high white‑cell count and vomiting, doctors wanted to rule out meningitis that could be hidden while treating her UTI.  \n\nThe parents were told about the lumbar puncture, the moderate sedation, the risks (bleeding, infection, breathing problems), benefits, and alternatives. They asked questions and agreed to proceed.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter a “time out” check, the child was fitted with monitoring equipment and vital signs were taken. I gave her 1 mg of Versed IV, which made her sleepy. Respiratory, heart, and oxygen monitors were attached. I then gave 20 µg of fentanyl IV. She was positioned on her left side.  \n\nDr. X cleaned her back with Betadine in a sterile way. He inserted a 22‑gauge, 1.5‑inch spinal needle at the L3‑L4 space under my supervision. The first attempt did not get fluid, so the needle was withdrawn. The nurse repositioned her slightly and Dr. X re‑inserted the needle at the same spot. This time clear fluid was obtained—about 3 mL. The needle was removed, a bandage was applied, and the back was cleaned again.  \n\nNo complications happened; her breathing, heart rate, and oxygen levels stayed stable. EMLA cream had been used before the procedure and was removed before cleaning the back. The fluid will be sent for a cell count, Gram stain, culture, protein, and glucose tests.  \n\n**After the procedure:**  \nThe child was taken back to the medical floor in good condition."
