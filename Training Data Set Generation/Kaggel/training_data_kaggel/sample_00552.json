  "medical": "CC: Sensory loss. HX: 25y/o RHF began experiencing pruritus in the RUE, above the elbow and in the right scapular region, on 10/23/92. In addition she had paresthesias in the proximal BLE and toes of the right foot. Her symptoms resolved the following day. On 10/25/92, she awoke in the morning and her legs felt &quot;asleep&quot; with decreased sensation. The sensory loss gradually progressed rostrally to the mid chest. She felt unsteady on her feet and had difficulty ambulating. In addition she also began to experience pain in the right scapular region. She denied any heat or cold intolerance, fatigue, weight loss. MEDS: None. PMH: Unremarkable. FHX: GF with CAD, otherwise unremarkable. SHX: Married, unemployed. 2 children. Patient was born and raised in Iowa. Denied any h/o Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP121/66 HR77 RR14 36.5C MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech normal with logical lucid thought process. CN: mild optic disk pallor OS. No RAPD. EOM full and smooth. No INO. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: Full strength throughout all extremities except for 5/4+ hip extensors. Normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: Decreased PP/LT below T4-5 on the left side down to the feet. Decreased PP/LT/VIB in BLE (left worse than right). Allodynic in RUE. Coord: Intact FNF, HKS and RAM, bilaterally. Station: No pronator drift. Romberg's test not documented. Gait: Unsteady wide-based. Able to TT and HW. Poor TW. Reflexes: 3/3 BUE. Hoffman's signs were present bilaterally. 4/4 patellae. 3+/3+ Achilles with 3-4 beat nonsustained clonus. Plantar responses were extensor on the right and flexor on the left. Gen. Exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, FT4, TSH, ANA, Vit B12, Folate, VDRL and Urinalysis were normal. MRI T-spine, 10/27/92, was unremarkable. MRI Brain, 10/28/92, revealed multiple areas of abnormally increased signal on T2 weighted images in the white matter regions of the right corpus callosum, periventricular region, brachium pontis and right pons. The appearance of the lesions was felt to be strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 10/28/92, Lumbar puncture revealed the following CSF results: RBC 1, WBC 9 (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), Glucose 55mg/dl, Protein 46mg/dl (normal 15-45), CSF IgG 7.5mg/dl (normal 0.0-6.2), CSF IgG index 1.3 (normal 0.0-0.7), agarose gel electrophoresis revealed oligoclonal bands in the gamma region which were not seen on the serum sample. Beta-2 microglobulin was unremarkable. An abnormal left tibial somatosensory evoked potential was noted consistent with central conduction slowing. Visual and Brainstem Auditory evoked potentials were normal. HTLV-1 titers were negative. CSF cultures and cytology were negative. She was not treated with medications as her symptoms were primarily sensory and non-debilitating, and she was discharged home. She returned on 11/7/92 as her symptoms of RUE dysesthesia, lower extremity paresthesia and weakness, all worsened. On 11/6/92, she developed slow slurred speech and had marked difficulty expressing her thoughts. She also began having difficulty emptying her bladder. Her 11/7/92 exam was notable for normal vital signs, lying motionless with eyes open and nodding and rhythmically blinking every few minutes. She was oriented to place and time of day, but not to season, day of the week and she did not know who she was. She had a leftward gaze preference and right lower facial weakness. Her RLE was spastic with sustained ankle clonus. There was dysesthetic sensory perception in the RUE. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present. MRI brain, 11/7/92, revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal region is more prominent than on prior study. The left centrum semiovale lesion has less enhancement than previously. Multiple other white matter lesions are demonstrated on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions on both sides have increased in size since the 10/92 MRI. The findings were felt more consistent with demyelinating disease and less likely glioma. Post-viral encephalitis, Rapidly progressive demyelinating disease and tumor were in the differential diagnosis. Lumbar Puncture, 11/8/92, revealed: RBC 2, WBC 12 (12 lymphocytes), Glucose 57, Protein 51 (elevated), cytology and cultures were negative. HIV 1 titer was negative. Urine drug screen, negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto-occipital region was consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with Decadron 6mg IV qhours and Cytoxan 0.75gm/m2 (1.25gm). On 12/3/92, she has a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the LUE, loss of consciousness and rightward eye deviation. EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent right-sided sharp discharges. She was placed on Dilantin. She became depressed.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Loss of feeling.  \n**History:** A 25‑year‑old woman with right‑hand weakness (RHF) first noticed itching in her right arm above the elbow and in the right shoulder area on October 23, 1992. She also felt tingling in the upper part of both legs and the toes of her right foot. The symptoms went away the next day. On October 25, 1992 she woke up with numb legs that felt “asleep.” The numbness slowly moved up to her mid‑chest. She felt unsteady and had trouble walking, and she began to feel pain in the right shoulder area. She said she had no problems with hot or cold, no fatigue, and no weight loss. She was not taking any medications. Her past medical history was normal. Her family history: her grandmother had coronary artery disease. She is married, unemployed, has two children, was born and raised in Iowa, and denies smoking, alcohol, or drug use.\n\n**Physical exam (October 25):**  \n- Blood pressure 121/66, heart rate 77, breathing 14, temperature 36.5 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Speech normal.  \n- Mild optic disc pallor in the left eye, no relative afferent pupillary defect.  \n- Eye movements normal. No internuclear ophthalmoplegia.  \n- Motor strength normal in all limbs except slightly weak hip extensors on the left (5/4+). Muscle tone and bulk normal.  \n- Sensation: reduced pain, pressure, light touch below T4‑T5 on the left side down to the feet; reduced pain, pressure, light touch, and vibration in both legs (left worse than right). She had pain from light touch in the right arm.  \n- Coordination intact. No pronator drift. Romberg not recorded.  \n- Gait wide‑based and unsteady. She could walk on toes and heels but had poor balance.  \n- Reflexes 3/3 in both arms; Hoffman's sign present on both sides; patellar reflex 4/4; Achilles 3+/3+ with brief clonus. Plantar responses: extensor on the right, flexor on the left.  \n- General exam normal.\n\n**Course (October 27‑28):**  \nBlood tests (CBC, electrolytes, PT, PTT, ESR, thyroid, ANA, B12, folate, VDRL, urinalysis) were normal. MRI of the thoracic spine was normal. MRI of the brain showed multiple bright spots on T2 images in white‑matter areas of the right corpus callosum, near the ventricles, in the pons, and in the brachium pontis. These findings were strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. A lumbar puncture on October 28 showed: 1 red cell, 9 white cells (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), glucose 55 mg/dL, protein 46 mg/dL (slightly high), IgG 7.5 mg/dL (high), IgG index 1.3 (high). Oligoclonal bands were present in the CSF but not in the blood. Other tests (beta‑2 microglobulin, evoked potentials, visual and auditory evoked potentials, HTLV‑1, CSF cultures, cytology) were normal or negative. She was not given medication because her symptoms were mainly sensory and not disabling, and she was sent home.\n\n**Return visit (November 7):**  \nHer symptoms had worsened: more itching in the right arm, tingling and weakness in the legs, and slurred speech. She had trouble speaking clearly and had difficulty emptying her bladder. On exam she had normal vital signs but was lying still, eyes open, nodding, and blinking rhythmically. She was aware of her location and the time of day but did not know the season, day of the week, or her own identity. She had a leftward eye preference and weakness of the lower right face. Her right leg was spastic with ankle clonus. She had abnormal sensation in the right arm. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present.  \n\nMRI of the brain on November 7 showed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal lesion was larger than before; the left centrum semiovale lesion was less enhanced. Other white‑matter lesions were seen on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations, and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions had increased in size since October. The findings were more consistent with a demyelinating disease than a tumor. Differential diagnosis included post‑viral encephalitis, rapidly progressive demyelinating disease, and tumor.  \n\nLumbar puncture on November 8: 2 red cells, 12 white cells (all lymphocytes), glucose 57, protein 51 mg/dL (high). Cytology and cultures negative. HIV negative. Urine drug screen negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto‑occipital region confirmed demyelinating disease.  \n\n**Treatment:** She received intravenous Decadron 6 mg every few hours and Cytoxan 0.75 g/m² (1.25 g).  \n\n**Follow‑up (December 3):** She had a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the left arm, loss of consciousness, and rightward eye deviation. EEG showed diffuse slowing with frequent right‑side sharp waves. She was started on Dilantin. She also became depressed."
