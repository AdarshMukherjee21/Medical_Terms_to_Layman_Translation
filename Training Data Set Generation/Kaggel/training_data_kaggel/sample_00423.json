  "medical": "PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Phenol neurolysis right obturator nerve, botulinum toxin injection right rectus femoris and vastus medialis intermedius and right pectoralis major muscles. PROCEDURE CODES: 64640 times one, 64614 times two, 95873 times two. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic right hemiparetic cerebral palsy, 343.1. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic right hemiparetic cerebral palsy, 343.1. ANESTHESIA: MAC. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient. She was brought to the minor procedure area and sedated per their protocol. The patient was positioned lying supine. Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine. The right obturator nerve was identified using active EMG stimulation lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse. Approximately 6 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location. At all sites of phenol injections, injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus. Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol. Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified with active EMG stimulation. Approximately 100 units was injected in the right pectoralis major and 100 units in the right rectus femoris and vastus intermedius muscles. Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 200 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.",
  "layman": "**What was done:**  \nThe doctor injected a chemical called phenol into the right obturator nerve to reduce muscle stiffness. The doctor also injected botulinum toxin (a muscle‑relaxing medicine) into the right rectus femoris, vastus medialis intermedius, and right pectoralis major muscles.\n\n**Procedure codes:**  \n- 64640 (once)  \n- 64614 (twice)  \n- 95873 (twice)\n\n**Before the procedure:**  \nThe patient had spastic right‑side weakness from cerebral palsy (ICD‑10 code 343.1).\n\n**After the procedure:**  \nThe diagnosis was unchanged: spastic right‑side weakness from cerebral palsy (343.1).\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nThe patient received monitored anesthesia care (MAC).\n\n**Complications:**  \nNone.\n\n**How the procedure was done:**  \nThe patient gave permission and was taken to a small‑procedure room. She was sedated according to the hospital’s protocol and lay on her back. The skin where the injections would be made was cleaned with chlorhexidine.  \n\nThe right obturator nerve was located by using EMG stimulation while the patient’s thigh was moving. About 6 mL of 5 % phenol was injected at that spot. The injections were made where the hip adductor muscles contracted the most and where the EMG signal was strongest. Blood was checked and cleared before each phenol injection.  \n\nThe muscles that received botulinum toxin were also found using EMG stimulation. About 100 units of the toxin were injected into the right pectoralis major and another 100 units into the right rectus femoris and vastus intermedius. In total, 200 units of botulinum toxin were given, diluted to 25 units per milliliter.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and no problems occurred."
