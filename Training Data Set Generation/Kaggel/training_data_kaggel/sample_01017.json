  "medical": "Your patient, (ABC), a 59-year-old female with no known coronary artery disease was referred to us for a CT coronary angiogram. The patient's cardiac risk factors include chest discomfort, family history of coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. She is on no cardiac medications at the time of testing. The patient's resting ECG demonstrated no ischemic changes. CARDIAC CT INCLUDING CORONARY CT ANGIOGRAPHY PROCEDURE: Breath hold cardiac CT was performed using a 64-channel CT scanner with a 0.5-second rotation time. Contrast injection was timed using a 10 mL bolus of Ultravist 370 IV. Then the patient received 75 mL of Ultravist 370 at a rate of 5 mL/sec. Retrospective ECG gating was performed. The patient received 0.4 milligrams of sublingual nitroglycerin prior to the to the scan. The average heart rate was 62 beats/min. The patient had no adverse reaction to the contrast. Multiphase retrospective reconstructions were performed. Small field of view cardiac and coronary images were analyzed on a 3D work station. Multiplanar reformatted images and 3D volume rendering was performed by the attending physician for the purpose of defining coronary anatomy and determining the extent of coronary artery disease. CORONARY CTA: 1. The technical quality of the scan is adequate. 2. The coronary ostia are in their normal position. The coronary anatomy is right dominant. 3. LEFT MAIN: The left main coronary artery is patent without angiographic stenosis. 4. LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY: The proximal aspect of the left anterior descending artery demonstrates a mixed plaque consisting of both calcified and noncalcified lesion which is less than 30% in stenosis severity. Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 branches of the left anterior descending artery demonstrate mild irregularities. 5. The ramus intermedius is a small vessel with minor irregularities. 6. LEFT CIRCUMFLEX: The left circumflex and obtuse marginal 1 and obtuse marginal 2 branches of the vessel are patent without significant stenosis. 7. RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: The right coronary artery is a large and dominant vessel. It demonstrates within its mid-segment calcified atherosclerosis, less than 50% stenosis severity. Left ventricular ejection fraction is calculated to be 69%. There are no wall motion abnormalities. 8. Coronary calcium score was calculated to be 79, indicating at least mild atherosclerosis within the coronary vessels. ANCILLARY FINDINGS: None. FINAL IMPRESSION: 1. Mild coronary artery disease with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 69%. 2. Recommendation is aggressive medical management consisting of aggressive lifestyle modifications and statin therapy. Thank you for referring this patient to us.",
  "layman": "Your patient, ABC, is a 59‑year‑old woman who has no known coronary artery disease. She was sent to us for a CT coronary angiogram. Her heart risk factors are chest pain, a family history of coronary artery disease, and high cholesterol. She is not taking any heart medications when she was tested. A resting ECG showed no signs of heart damage.\n\n**CT Scan Procedure**  \nThe scan was done with a 64‑slice CT scanner that takes images quickly (0.5‑second rotation). We used a contrast dye: a 10 mL quick burst of Ultravist 370 followed by 75 mL at 5 mL per second. The scan was timed with her heart rhythm (retrospective ECG gating). She was given 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin under her tongue before the scan. Her average heart rate was 62 beats per minute. She had no reaction to the contrast. We made multiple image reconstructions and looked at the heart and coronary arteries on a 3‑D workstation. The attending doctor used these images to map the coronary anatomy and check for disease.\n\n**CT Angiogram Findings**  \n1. The scan quality is good.  \n2. The openings of the coronary arteries are in normal places. The heart’s blood flow is right‑dominant.  \n3. **Left Main** – The left main artery is open with no blockage.  \n4. **Left Anterior Descending (LAD)** – Near the start of the LAD, there is a plaque that is partly calcified and partly soft, causing less than 30% narrowing. The first two diagonal branches of the LAD show mild irregularities.  \n5. The ramus intermedius is a small vessel with minor irregularities.  \n6. **Left Circumflex (LCX)** – The LCX and its first two branches (obtuse marginal 1 and 2) are open with no significant narrowing.  \n7. **Right Coronary Artery (RCA)** – The RCA is large and dominant. In its middle part it has calcified plaque, causing less than 50% narrowing. The left ventricle pumps out 69% of the blood (normal ejection fraction) and there are no abnormal wall movements.  \n8. The coronary calcium score is 79, indicating mild plaque buildup in the coronary vessels.\n\n**Other Findings** – None.\n\n**Final Impression**  \n1. Mild coronary artery disease with a normal left‑ventricle pumping function (69%).  \n2. The recommendation is to start aggressive medical management, including strong lifestyle changes and statin medication.  \n\nThank you for referring this patient to us."
