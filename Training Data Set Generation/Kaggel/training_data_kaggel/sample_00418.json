  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female with an enlarging mass of the left parotid region. FINDINGS: There is a well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland measuring approximately 2.4 X 3.9 X 3.0cm (AP X transverse X craniocaudal) in size. The lesion is well demarcated. There is a solid peripheral rim with a mean attenuation coefficient of 56.3. There is a central cystic appearing area with a mean attenuation coefficient of 28.1 HU, suggesting an area of central necrosis. There is the suggestion of mild peripheral rim enhancement. This large lesion within the deep lobe of the parotid gland abuts and effaces the facial nerve. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation would be necessary for definitive diagnosis. The right parotid gland is normal. There is mild enlargement of the left jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.1cm in size, with normal morphology (image #33/68). There is mild enlargement of the right jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.2cm in size, with normal morphology (image #38/68). There are demonstrated bilateral deep lateral cervical nodes at the midlevel, measuring 0.6cm on the right side and 0.9cm on the left side (image #29/68). There is a second midlevel deep lateral cervical node demonstrated on the left side (image #20/68), measuring 0.7cm in size. There are small bilateral low level nodes involving the deep lateral cervical nodal chain (image #15/68) measuring 0.5cm in size. There is no demonstrated nodal enlargement of the spinal accessory or pretracheal nodal chains. The right parotid gland is normal and there is no right parotid gland mass lesion. Normal bilateral submandibular glands. Normal parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal and perivertebral spaces. Normal carotid spaces. IMPRESSION: Large, well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland, with probable involvement of the left facial nerve. See above for size, morphology and pattern enhancement. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation is necessary for specificity. Multiple visualized nodes of the bilateral deep lateral cervical nodal chain, within normal size and morphology, most compatible with mild hyperplasia.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged woman who has a growing lump in the left side of her face near the parotid gland.  \n\n**Findings**  \n- A clear, well‑defined mass is seen in the deep part of the left parotid gland. It measures about 2.4 cm front‑to‑back, 3.9 cm wide, and 3.0 cm tall.  \n- The outer edge of the mass is solid and has a density of 56.3 on the scan.  \n- Inside the mass there is a central area that looks like a cyst, with a density of 28.1, which suggests that part of the mass has died (necrosis).  \n- The outer edge shows a little more enhancement after contrast is given.  \n- The mass is large enough to press against and push aside the facial nerve.  \n- The most likely diagnosis is a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), but other solid tumors cannot be ruled out. A tissue sample would be needed to confirm the exact type.  \n- The right parotid gland looks normal.  \n\n**Lymph nodes**  \n- The left jugulodigastric node is slightly enlarged (1.1 cm) but looks normal.  \n- The right jugulodigastric node is also slightly enlarged (1.2 cm) and looks normal.  \n- There are several small nodes in the deep lateral cervical chain: 0.6 cm on the right, 0.9 cm on the left, and another 0.7 cm on the left.  \n- Small nodes (0.5 cm) are seen in the lower part of the deep lateral chain on both sides.  \n- No enlargement is seen in the spinal accessory or pretracheal node groups.  \n- The submandibular glands, parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, perivertebral, and carotid spaces are all normal.  \n\n**Impression**  \nA large, well‑defined mass in the deep part of the left parotid gland that likely involves the left facial nerve. The size, shape, and enhancement pattern are described above. The leading guess is a benign mixed tumor, but other solid tumors cannot be excluded; a biopsy is needed for a definitive diagnosis. Several lymph nodes are visible but are within normal size and shape, suggesting mild reactive enlargement."
