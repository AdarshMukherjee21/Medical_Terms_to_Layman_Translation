  "medical": "PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Selective ascending aortic arch angiogram. 2. Selective left common carotid artery angiogram. 3. Selective right common carotid artery angiogram. 4. Selective left subclavian artery angiogram. 5. Right iliac angio with runoff. 6. Bilateral cerebral angiograms were performed as well via right and left common carotid artery injections. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: TIA, aortic stenosis, postoperative procedure. Moderate carotid artery stenosis. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 400 ml. SPECIMENS REMOVED: Not applicable. TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia. Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French sheath was placed into the right common femoral artery and vein without complication. Using injection through the side port of the sheath, a right iliac angiogram with runoff was performed. Following this, straight pigtail catheter was used to advance the aortic arch and aortic arch angiogram under digital subtraction was performed. Following this, selective engagement in left common carotid artery, right common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery angiograms were performed with a V-Tech catheter over an 0.035-inch wire. ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: 1. Type 2 aortic arch. 2. Left subclavian artery was patent. 3 Left vertebral artery was patent. 4. Left internal carotid artery had a 40% to 50% lesion with ulceration, not treated and there was no cerebral cross over. 5. Right common carotid artery had a 60% to 70% lesion which was heavily calcified and was not treated with the summed left-to-right cross over flow. 6. Closure was with a 6-French Angio-Seal of the artery, and the venous sheath was sutured in. PLAN: Continue aspirin, Plavix, and Coumadin to an INR of 2 with a carotid duplex followup.",
  "layman": "**Procedure Done:**  \n1. X‑ray images of the upper part of the aorta (aortic arch).  \n2. X‑ray images of the left common carotid artery.  \n3. X‑ray images of the right common carotid artery.  \n4. X‑ray images of the left subclavian artery.  \n5. X‑ray images of the right iliac artery with flow to the legs.  \n6. X‑ray images of both sides of the brain through the carotid arteries.\n\n**Why It Was Done:**  \n- A transient ischemic attack (TIA).  \n- Narrowing of the aortic valve.  \n- After surgery.  \n- Moderate narrowing of the carotid arteries.\n\n**Blood Loss:** About 400 ml.\n\n**Samples Taken:** None.\n\n**How It Was Done:**  \nAfter the patient gave permission, she was taken to the heart‑catheter lab while she was not eating and not sedated. The right groin was cleaned and covered with sterile cloth. A local anesthetic (lidocaine 2%) was injected. Using a small needle technique, a 6‑French sheath was inserted into the right common femoral artery and vein without problems. A small catheter was used to take images of the right iliac artery and the flow to the legs. Then a straight pigtail catheter was guided into the aortic arch to take detailed images. After that, a V‑Tech catheter over a 0.035‑inch wire was used to image the left common carotid, right common carotid, and left subclavian arteries.\n\n**What the Images Showed:**  \n1. The aortic arch is a type 2 shape.  \n2. The left subclavian artery is open.  \n3. The left vertebral artery is open.  \n4. The left internal carotid artery has a 40‑50% narrowing with an ulcer, but it was not treated and there was no blood flow to the opposite side of the brain.  \n5. The right common carotid artery has a 60‑70% narrowing that is heavily calcified; it was not treated and the blood flow from left to right was not enough.  \n6. The artery was closed with a 6‑French Angio‑Seal device, and the vein was stitched closed.\n\n**Plan Going Forward:**  \nContinue taking aspirin, Plavix, and Coumadin until the INR is 2. A carotid duplex ultrasound will be done later to check the arteries."
