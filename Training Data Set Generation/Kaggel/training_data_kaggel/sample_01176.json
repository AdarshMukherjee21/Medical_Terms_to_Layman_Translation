  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left testicular torsion, possibly detorsion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left testicular torsion, possibly detorsion. PROCEDURE: Left scrotal exploration with detorsion. Already, de-torsed bilateral testes fixation and bilateral appendix testes cautery. ANESTHETIC: A 0.25% Marcaine local wound insufflation per surgeon, 15 mL of Toradol. FINDINGS: Congestion in the left testis and cord with a bell-clapper deformity on the right small appendix testes bilaterally. No testis necrosis. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 5 mL. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloid. TUBES AND DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: No tissues sent to pathology. COUNTS: Sponges and needle counts were correct x2. INDICATIONS OF OPERATION: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with abrupt onset of left testicular pain. He has had a history of similar onset. Apparently, he had no full on one ultrasound and full on a second ultrasound, but because of possible torsion, detorsion, or incomplete detorsion, I recommended an exploration. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was placed in supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Superior scrotal incisions were then made with 15-blade knife and further extended up to the subcutaneous tissue and dartos fascia with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The subdartos pouch was created with curved tenotomy scissors. The tunica vaginalis was then delivered, incised, and testis was delivered. The testis itself with a bell-clapper deformity. There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord. The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created. The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation. No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used. The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis. A similar procedure was performed on the right side. Again, an appendix testis was cauterized. No torsion was seen. He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture. The local anesthetic was then used for both as cord block, as well as a local wound insufflation bilaterally with 0.25% Marcaine. The scrotal wall was then closed with subcuticular closure of #4-0 chromic. Dermabond tissue adhesive was then used. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He was given IV Toradol and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** The boy’s left testicle was twisted (torsion) and may have been untwisted (detorsion).  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Same as before – left testicle twisted, possibly untwisted.  \n\n**Procedure:** The surgeon opened the left side of the scrotum to untwist the testicle. Both testicles were then fixed in place and any small extra tissue (appendix testes) on both sides was cauterized (burned to stop bleeding).  \n\n**Anesthesia:** Local pain relief with 0.25% Marcaine and 15 mL of Toradol (a pain‑relief drug).  \n\n**Findings:** The left testicle and its cord were swollen, but the right side had a small extra tissue on both sides. No testicle was dead.  \n\n**Estimated blood loss:** 5 mL.  \n**Fluids given:** 300 mL of crystalloid solution.  \n**Tubes and drains:** None.  \n**Specimens sent to pathology:** None.  \n**Counts:** All sponges and needles were accounted for.  \n\n**Reason for surgery:** A 4‑year‑old boy suddenly had severe pain in his left testicle. He had had similar pain before. Ultrasound tests were unclear, so the surgeon decided to explore the area to check for twisting or incomplete untwisting.  \n\n**Operation description:**  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room, checked for correct identity and surgical site, and given anesthesia. He was laid on his back and the area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The surgeon made a small cut in the upper part of the scrotum with a 15‑blade knife and extended it into the tissue and fascia using a small electric cautery tool to stop bleeding. A pouch was created under the skin with scissors. The outer covering of the testicle (tunica vaginalis) was opened, and the testicle was brought out. The testicle had a bell‑clapper deformity (a shape that can twist easily). It was not twisted at the time of surgery, but it was somewhat swollen and the blood vessels were very congested. The surgeon cauterized the surrounding fascia and made the pouch. The upper part of the fascia was closed with a purse‑string stitch using 4‑0 chromic suture. The testicle was placed back into the scrotum in the correct position. No stitches were placed inside the testicle. The outer covering was wrapped around the back of the testicle. The same steps were repeated on the right side. The small extra tissue on the right was cauterized. No twisting was seen on the right. The right side also had a bell‑clapper deformity, a pouch was made, the testicle was positioned correctly, and the upper fascia was closed with a 4‑0 chromic suture. Local anesthetic was used for both sides as a nerve block and to fill the wound with 0.25% Marcaine. The scrotal wall was closed with a subcuticular stitch using 4‑0 chromic, and Dermabond adhesive was applied. The boy tolerated the surgery well. He received IV Toradol for pain and was taken to recovery in stable condition."
