  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal ureteral stone. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal ureteral stone. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Cystopyelogram, left ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy, stone basket extraction, stent exchange with a string attached. ANESTHESIA: LMA. EBL: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given antibiotics, 1 g of Ancef and the patient was on oral antibiotics at home. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 61-year-old female with history of recurrent uroseptic stones. The patient had stones x2, 1 was already removed, second one came down, had recurrent episode of sepsis, stent was placed. Options were given such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, shockwave lithotripsy etc. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, need for stent, and removal of the stent were discussed. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system. Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed. A semirigid ureteroscopy was done. A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter. Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces. Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed. Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative. There were no further stones. Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal. The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent. There were no further stones. Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours. Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed. There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please note that the string was kept in place and the patient was to remove the stent the next day. The patient's family was instructed how to do so. The patient had antibiotics and pain medications at home. The patient was brought to recovery room in a stable condition.",

She had two stones: one was removed earlier, the second passed on its own but caused another sepsis episode, so a stent was placed. She was told about options such as watching, laser, or shockwave treatment, and the risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, and the need for a stent. She understood and chose to have the procedure.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, given anesthesia, and positioned on her back. She was cleaned and covered in a sterile way. A 0.035 inch guidewire was inserted into the left kidney system. The existing left stent was removed with graspers. A semi‑rigid scope was passed into the ureter. A stone was seen in the middle‑upper ureter. The laser broke the stone into 5–6 small pieces, which were removed with a basket. The scope was then passed all the way up to the ureter‑kidney junction (UPJ) and no more stones were found. A pyelogram (X‑ray of the kidney drainage) showed the rest of the system was normal. The entire left ureter was open and clear. Because of swelling from the surgery, a new 26 mm double‑J stent was placed over the guidewire, with a curl in the kidney and another in the bladder. A string was left attached to the stent so the patient could pull it out in about 24 hours. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was given instructions on how to remove the stent the next day and was given antibiotics and pain medicine for home. She was taken to recovery in stable condition."
