POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic venous hypertension with painful varicosities, lower extremities, bilaterally. PROCEDURES 1. Greater saphenous vein stripping and stab phlebectomies requiring 10 to 20 incisions, right leg. 2. Greater saphenous vein stripping and stab phlebectomies requiring 10 to 20 incisions, left leg. PROCEDURE DETAIL: After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a general endotracheal anesthesia. A time-out process was followed and antibiotics were given. Then, both legs were prepped and draped in the usual fashion with the patient was in the supine position. An incision was made in the right groin and the greater saphenous vein at its junction with the femoral vein was dissected out and all branches were ligated and divided. Then, an incision was made just below the knee where the greater saphenous vein was also found and connection to varices from the calf were seen. A third incision was made in the distal third of the right thigh in the area where there was a communication with large branch varicosities. Then, a vein stripper was passed from the right calf up to the groin and the greater saphenous vein, which was divided, was stripped without any difficultly. Several minutes of compression was used for hemostasis. Then, the exposed branch varicosities both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stabs were performed to do stab phlebectomies at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf as much as the position would allow us to do. Then in the left thigh, a groin incision was made and the greater saphenous vein was dissected out in the same way as was on the other side. Also, an incision was made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein was isolated there. The saphenous vein was stripped and a several minutes of local compression was performed for hemostasis. Then, a number of stabs to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosities to the extent that the patient's position would allow us. Then, all incisions were closed in layers with Vicryl and staples. Then, the patient was placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomies of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stabs in each leg. The stab phlebectomies were performed with a hook and they were very satisfactory. Hemostasis achieved with compression and then staples were applied to the skin. Then, the patient was rolled onto a stretcher where both legs were wrapped with the Kerlix, fluffs, and Ace bandages. Estimated blood loss probably was about 150 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition. The patient is to be observed, so a decision will be made whether she needs to stay overnight or be able to go home.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic venous hypertension with painful varicose veins in both legs.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as pre‑operative.\n\nPROCEDURES  \n1. Removal of the great saphenous vein and small vein excisions (10–20 cuts) on the right leg.  \n2. Same procedure on the left leg.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAIL  \nAfter the patient gave informed consent, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia through a breathing tube. A safety “time‑out” was done and antibiotics were given. Both legs were cleaned and covered, and the patient lay on her back.\n\nRight leg:  \n- A cut was made in the right groin to find the great saphenous vein where it joins the femoral vein. The vein and all its branches were tied off and cut.  \n- A second cut was made just below the knee where the vein was again found, and connections to calf varicose veins were seen.  \n- A third cut was made in the lower third of the thigh where the vein connected to large varicose branches.  \n- A special tool (vein stripper) was passed from the calf up to the groin to remove the great saphenous vein. The vein was removed easily.  \n- The exposed varicose veins in the lower thigh and calf were cut out, and many small “stab” cuts were made to remove them where the patient’s position allowed.  \n\nLeft leg:  \n- The same steps were repeated: a groin cut, a knee cut, the vein was stripped, and small cuts were made in the calf to remove varicose veins.  \n\nAll cuts were closed in layers with Vicryl stitches and staples.  \nAfter the main work, the patient was turned to lie on her stomach and additional small cuts (10–20 per leg) were made in the thighs and calves to remove more varicose veins. These were done with a hook and were satisfactory. The wounds were sealed with compression and staples.  \n\nThe patient was moved onto a stretcher, and both legs were wrapped with gauze and elastic bandages. Estimated blood loss was about 150 mL. She tolerated the surgery well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition. She will be monitored to decide if she needs to stay overnight or can go home."
