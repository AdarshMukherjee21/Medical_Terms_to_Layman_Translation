  "medical": "EXAM: Lumbar spine CT without contrast. HISTORY: Back pain after a fall. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial images were acquired through the lumbar spine. Coronal and sagittal reconstruction views were also obtained. FINDINGS: There is no evidence for acute fracture or subluxation. There is no spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. The central canal and neuroforamen are grossly patent at all levels. There are no abnormal paraspinal masses. There is no wedge/compression deformity. There is intervertebral disk space narrowing to a mild degree at L2-3 and L4-5. Soft tissue windows demonstrate atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta, which is not dilated. There was incompletely visualized probable simple left renal cyst, exophytic at the lower pole. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for acute fracture or subluxation. 2. Mild degenerative changes. 3. Probable left simple renal cyst.",
  "layman": "EXAM: CT scan of the lower back without contrast.  \nHISTORY: Back pain after a fall.  \n\nTECHNIQUE: Images were taken in cross‑sectional slices through the lower spine.  Additional side‑view and front‑view reconstructions were made.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n- No new broken bones or dislocations.  \n- No cracks or slipping of the vertebrae.  \n- The spinal canal and the openings for nerves are wide enough at all levels.  \n- No abnormal growths next to the spine.  \n- No wedge‑shaped or compressed vertebrae.  \n- The spaces between the vertebrae are slightly narrowed at levels L2‑3 and L4‑5.  \n- The abdominal aorta shows plaque buildup but is not enlarged.  \n- A small, likely simple cyst was seen on the lower part of the left kidney, but it was not fully captured.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. No new fractures or dislocations.  \n2. Mild age‑related changes in the spine.  \n3. A probable simple cyst on the left kidney."
