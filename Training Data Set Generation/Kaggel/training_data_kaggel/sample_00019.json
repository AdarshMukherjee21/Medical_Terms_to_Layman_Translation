  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Rectal bleeding and perirectal abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Perianal abscess. MEDICATIONS: MAC. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis. Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction. There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening. The scope was withdrawn. A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position). Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening. There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material. Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable. In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area. The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position. The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek. There were no other abnormalities noted. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum. 2. Opening in the skin at the external anal verge, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess, with no palpable abscess at this time, and with no evidence of fistulous connection to the bowel lumen. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Continue antibiotics. 2. Followup with Dr. X. 3. If drainage persists, consider surgical drainage.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Colonoscopy.  \n\n**Before the procedure:** The patient had rectal bleeding and a perirectal abscess.  \n\n**After the procedure:** The diagnosis was a perianal abscess.  \n\n**Medication:** MAC.  \n\n**What was done:** A small, flexible scope was gently inserted through the rectum and moved through the colon to the cecum, then through the valve into the end of the small intestine. The prep was good and all parts were clearly seen. The lining of the colon and the end of the small intestine looked normal, with no signs of inflammation. Extra care was taken to look at the rectum, including turning the scope back on itself to view the lower rectum and the area where the rectum meets the anus. No inflammation or abnormal openings were found there.  \n\nWhen the scope was pulled out, a careful look at the anal canal and the skin around the anus showed a jagged 8‑mm opening at the back of the rectum (at the 12 o’clock position). Some pus could be squeezed out of this opening. There was no large pocket of inflamed tissue or undrained pus. The back wall of the lower rectum and anal canal was soft and normal. Two scars were seen around the anus: a small dimpled scar 1 cm from the anal opening at the 11 o’clock position, and another dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal opening on the left side of the buttock. No other problems were found. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery.  \n\n**Final diagnoses:**  \n1. Normal colon and small intestine up to the end of the small intestine.  \n2. An opening in the skin at the anal opening that matches drainage from a perianal abscess; no abscess is felt now and no abnormal connection to the bowel.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Keep taking antibiotics.  \n2. Follow up with Dr. X.  \n3. If drainage continues, consider surgical drainage."
