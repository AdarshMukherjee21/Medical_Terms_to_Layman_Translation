  "medical": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left foot pain. HISTORY: XYZ is a basketball player for University of Houston who sustained an injury the day prior. They were traveling. He came down on another player's foot sustaining what he describes as an inversion injury. Swelling and pain onset immediately. He was taped but was able to continue playing He was examined by John Houston, the trainer, and had tenderness around the navicular so was asked to come over and see me for evaluation. He has been in a walking boot. He has been taped firmly. Pain with weightbearing activities. He is limping a bit. No significant foot injuries in the past. Most of his pain is located around the dorsal aspect of the hindfoot and midfoot. PHYSICAL EXAM: He does have some swelling from the hindfoot out toward the midfoot. His arch is maintained. His motion at the ankle and subtalar joints is preserved. Forefoot motion is intact. He has pain with adduction and abduction across the hindfoot. Most of this discomfort is laterally. His motor strength is grossly intact. His sensation is intact, and his pulses are palpable and strong. His ankle is not tender. He has minimal to no tenderness over the ATFL. He has no medial tenderness along the deltoid or the medial malleolus. His anterior drawer is solid. His external rotation stress is not painful at the ankle. His tarsometatarsal joints, specifically 1, 2 and 3, are nontender. His maximal tenderness is located laterally along the calcaneocuboid joint and along the anterior process of the calcaneus. Some tenderness over the dorsolateral side of the talonavicular joint as well. The medial talonavicular joint is not tender. RADIOGRAPHS: Those done of his foot weightbearing show some changes over the dorsal aspect of the navicular that appear chronic. I don't see a definite fracture. The tarsometarsal joints are anatomically aligned. Radiographs of his ankle again show changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint but no other fractures identified. Review of an MR scan of the ankle dated 12/01/05 shows what looks like some changes along the lateral side of the calcaneocuboid joint with disruption of the lateral ligament and capsular area. Also some changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint. I don't see any significant marrow edema or definitive fracture line. IMPRESSION: Left Chopart joint sprain. PLAN: I have spoken to XYZ about this. Continue with ice and boot for weightbearing activities. We will start him on a functional rehab program and progress him back to activities when his symptoms allow. He is clear on the prolonged duration of recovery for these hindfoot type injuries.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Pain in the left foot.\n\n**History:**  \nXYZ is a basketball player at the University of Houston. Yesterday, while traveling, he fell on another player’s foot and twisted his own foot. The injury happened right away and caused swelling and pain. He was taped and could keep playing, but a trainer, John Houston, felt tenderness near the navicular bone and asked him to see me. He has been wearing a walking boot and has tight taping. He still hurts when he puts weight on the foot and is limping a little. He has never had major foot injuries before. Most of his pain is on the top side of the back part of the foot and the middle part.\n\n**Physical Exam:**  \n- Swelling from the back of the foot to the middle part.  \n- The arch of the foot is still in place.  \n- The ankle and subtalar joints move normally.  \n- The front part of the foot moves normally.  \n- He feels pain when the back part of the foot is moved inward or outward, especially on the outer side.  \n- Muscle strength is good.  \n- Feeling and pulses are normal.  \n- The ankle itself is not tender.  \n- There is little or no tenderness over the ATFL ligament.  \n- No tenderness on the inside of the ankle.  \n- The ankle’s anterior drawer test is solid.  \n- The external rotation stress test is not painful.  \n- The joints between the toes and the foot (tarsometatarsal joints 1‑3) are not tender.  \n- The most painful spots are on the outer side of the calcaneocuboid joint and the front part of the heel bone.  \n- There is some tenderness on the outer side of the talonavicular joint, but the inner side is fine.\n\n**Radiographs:**  \nWeight‑bearing X‑rays of the foot show old changes on the top side of the navicular bone but no clear fracture. The tarsometatarsal joints look normal. X‑rays of the ankle show changes on the top side of the talonavicular joint but no fractures. An MRI from 12/01/05 shows changes on the outer side of the calcaneocuboid joint with damage to the outer ligament and capsule, and changes on the top side of the talonavicular joint. No significant bone marrow swelling or clear fracture line is seen.\n\n**Impression:**  \nLeft Chopart joint sprain (a sprain of the joint between the midfoot and hindfoot).\n\n**Plan:**  \nI talked with XYZ about his injury. He should keep using ice and the boot when putting weight on the foot. We will start a functional rehab program and gradually bring him back to activities as his symptoms improve. He understands that recovery from this type of hindfoot injury can take a long time."
