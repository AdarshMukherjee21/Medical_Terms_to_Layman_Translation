Left median sensory response 3.0, amplitude 1.2, distance 100. 4. Left median motor response distal 4.2, proximal 9, amplitude 2.2, distance 290, velocity 60.4 m/sec. 5. Right median motor response distal 4.3, proximal 9.7, amplitude 2, and velocity 53.7 m/sec. 6. Right ulnar motor response distal 2.5, proximal 7.5, amplitude 2, distance 300, velocity 60 m/sec. NEEDLE EMG TESTING 1. RIGHT BICEPS: Fibrillations 0, fasciculations occasional, positive waves 0. Motor units, increased needle insertional activity and mild decreased number of motor units firing. 2. RIGHT TRICEPS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations occasional to 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, increased needle insertional activity and decreased number of motor units firing. 3. EXTENSOR DIGITORUM: Fibrillations 0, fasciculations rare, positive waves 0, motor units probably normal. 4. FIRST DORSAL INTEROSSEOUS: Fibrillations 2+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 2+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 5. RIGHT ABDUCTOR POLLICIS BREVIS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 0. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 6. FLEXOR CARPI ULNARIS: Fibrillations 1+, occasionally entrained, fasciculations rare, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 7. LEFT FIRST DORSAL INTEROSSEOUS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves occasional. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 8. LEFT EXTENSOR DIGITORUM: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 9. RIGHT VASTUS MEDIALIS: Fibrillations 1+ to 2+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 10. ANTERIOR TIBIALIS: Fibrillations 2+, occasionally entrained, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, increased proportion of polyphasic units and decreased number of motor units firing. There is again increased needle insertional activity. 11. RIGHT GASTROCNEMIUS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, marked decreased number of motor units firing. 12. LEFT GASTROCNEMIUS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 2+. Motor units, marked decreased number of motor units firing. 13. LEFT VASTUS MEDIALIS: Fibrillations occasional, fasciculations occasional, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. IMPRESSION: Nerve conduction screen demonstrates borderline median sensory and borderline distal median motor responses in both hands. There is borderline evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The sensory and motor responses are noted to be attenuated in both upper extremities. The needle EMG examination is remarkable for rather diffuse active denervation changes in most muscles of the right upper and right lower extremity tested and there is active denervation in several muscles of the left arm and left leg as well. The diffuse nature of the active denervation changes in multiple myotomes of both upper and lower extremities suggests the possibility of motor neuron disease. Other neuropathic conditions, polymyositis, etc., need to be considered in differential diagnosis.",

Left median nerve (motor, distal): 4.2 mV, proximal 9 mV, amplitude 2.2 mV, distance 290 mm, speed 60.4 m/s.  \n5. Right median nerve (motor, distal): 4.3 mV, proximal 9.7 mV, amplitude 2 mV, speed 53.7 m/s.  \n6. Right ulnar nerve (motor, distal): 2.5 mV, proximal 7.5 mV, amplitude 2 mV, distance 300 mm, speed 60 m/s.\n\n**Needle EMG Test**\n\n1. **Right biceps** – no fibrillations, occasional twitching, no positive waves. Motor units show a slight drop in activity and a small increase in needle‑insertion activity.  \n2. **Right triceps** – mild fibrillations, occasional twitching, positive waves. Motor units show increased needle‑insertion activity and fewer firing units.  \n3. **Extensor digitorum** – no fibrillations, rare twitching, no positive waves. Motor units likely normal.  \n4. **First dorsal interosseous (right)** – moderate fibrillations, mild twitching, positive waves. Motor units show fewer firing units.  \n5. **Right abductor pollicis brevis** – mild fibrillations, mild twitching, no positive waves. Motor units show fewer firing units.  \n6. **Flexor carpi ulnaris** – mild fibrillations, occasional entrainment, rare twitching, positive waves. Motor units show fewer firing units.  \n7. **First dorsal interosseous (left)** – mild fibrillations, mild twitching, occasional positive waves. Motor units show fewer firing units.  \n8. **Extensor digitorum (left)** – mild fibrillations, mild twitching. Motor units show fewer firing units.  \n9. **Right vastus medialis** – mild‑moderate fibrillations, mild twitching, positive waves. Motor units show fewer firing units.  \n10. **Anterior tibialis** – moderate fibrillations, occasional entrainment, mild twitching, positive waves. Motor units show more complex patterns and fewer firing units; needle‑insertion activity is increased.  \n11. **Right gastrocnemius** – mild fibrillations, mild twitching, positive waves. Motor units show a marked drop in firing units.  \n12. **Left gastrocnemius** – mild fibrillations, mild twitching, moderate positive waves. Motor units show a marked drop in firing units.  \n13. **Left vastus medialis** – occasional fibrillations and twitching, positive waves. Motor units show fewer firing units.\n\n**Overall Impression**\n\n- The nerve conduction screen shows borderline results for median nerve sensory and motor responses in both hands, suggesting possible mild carpal tunnel syndrome on both sides.  \n- Sensory and motor signals are weaker in both arms.  \n- The EMG shows widespread signs of muscle fiber loss (denervation) in many muscles of the right arm and leg, and in several muscles of the left arm and leg.  \n- Because the denervation is spread across many muscle groups in both upper and lower limbs, a motor neuron disease is a possibility. Other nerve or muscle disorders, such as polymyositis, should also be considered."
