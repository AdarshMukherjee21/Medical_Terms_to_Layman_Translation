  "medical": "EXAM: Five views of the right knee. HISTORY: Pain. The patient is status-post surgery, he could not straighten his leg, pain in the back of the knee. TECHNIQUE: Five views of the right knee were evaluated. There are no priors for comparison. FINDINGS: Five views of the right knee were evaluated and they reveal there is no evidence of any displaced fractures, dislocations, or subluxations. There are multiple areas of growth arrest lines seen in the distal aspect of the femur and proximal aspect of the tibia. There is also appearance of a high-riding patella suggestive of patella alta. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of any displaced fractures, dislocations, or subluxations. 2. Growth arrest lines seen in the distal femur and proximal tibia. 3. Questionable appearance of a slightly high-riding patella, possibly suggesting patella alta.",
  "layman": "EXAM: X‑rays of the right knee from five angles.  \nHISTORY: The patient has pain. He had surgery and can’t straighten his leg. He feels pain at the back of the knee.  \nTECHNIQUE: The five X‑rays were looked at. There are no earlier images to compare with.  \nFINDINGS: The X‑rays show no broken bones that are out of place, no dislocations, and no partial dislocations. There are several lines in the lower part of the thigh bone and the upper part of the shin bone that look like growth stops. The kneecap also looks a little higher than normal, which could mean it is positioned too high (patella alta).  \nIMPRESSION: 1. No broken or displaced bones, no dislocations. 2. Growth‑stop lines in the lower thigh bone and upper shin bone. 3. The kneecap appears slightly high, possibly indicating patella alta."
