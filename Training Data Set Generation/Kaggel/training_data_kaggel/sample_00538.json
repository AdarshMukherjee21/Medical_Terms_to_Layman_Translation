  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left communicating hydrocele. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left communicating hydrocele. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE: Left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 5-year-old young man with fluid collection in the tunica vaginalis and peritesticular space on the left side consistent with a communicating hydrocele. The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year. I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options. All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum. We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac. The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed. There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic. A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair. After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine. A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds. Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures. The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents. The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl. After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure. The patient tolerated the operation well. He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition. Blood loss was minimal. No specimen was submitted.",

The fluid amount changes over time but has stayed about the same for the past year. I have talked with the boy’s mother in person and with his father on the phone over the last few months to explain the diagnosis and the surgical options. All of their questions were answered and the boy is ready for surgery today.  \n\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The boy had a very thin opening (patent processus vaginalis) that allowed a large fluid sac to form in the left scrotum. About 10–15 mL of fluid was drained from the sac. The opening was traced back to the peritoneal reflection, where it was tied off (high ligation). No other problems were seen in the groin or scrotum.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The boy was taken to the operating room and given general inhalation anesthesia. A peripheral IV was placed. A surgical “time‑out” was performed to confirm the patient’s identity and the planned procedure (left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair). After cleaning the area with a chlorhexidine solution, local anesthesia was given with 0.25% Marcaine and epinephrine, including blocks of the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves. A curved incision was made low in the left groin along a natural skin crease. Tissue was dissected through Scarpa’s layer to the external oblique fascia, which was opened to expose the spermatic cord. The opening (processus vaginalis) was freed from the cord, the hydrocele sac was opened and drained, and the opening was traced back to the deep inguinal ring. It was tied off there with a 3‑0 Vicryl suture, using both a transfixing and a mass ligature technique. The excess hydrocele and opening tissue were removed. The cord structures were returned to their normal position, and the external oblique and Scarpa’s layers were closed with interrupted 3‑0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with a subcuticular 5‑0 Monocryl stitch and Steri‑Strips. The boy tolerated the surgery well, was awakened, and moved to the recovery room in good condition. Blood loss was minimal and no tissue was sent for pathology."
