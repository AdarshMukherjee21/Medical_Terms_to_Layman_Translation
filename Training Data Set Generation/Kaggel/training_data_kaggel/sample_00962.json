  "layman": "This 34‑year‑old woman had an office ultrasound that did not show a fetal heartbeat. The scan shows she is 8 weeks and 2 days old by her dates. Inside her uterus is a gestational sac that is 2.1 cm in size, which matches a pregnancy of about 6 weeks and 4 days. A fetal pole (the early embryo) measures 7 mm, also about 6 weeks and 4 days. No heartbeat was seen on either Doppler or color Doppler. There is no fluid in the uterus. A cyst measuring 2.8 × 1.2 cm was found on the right side of the pelvis. The impression is that the pregnancy has stopped developing (fetal demise) at about 6 weeks and 4 days, even though the patient’s dates say 8 weeks and 2 days. The ultrasound tech called the preliminary report to the referring doctor."
