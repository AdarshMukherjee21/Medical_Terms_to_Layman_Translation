  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Endoscopy. CLINICAL INDICATIONS: Intermittent rectal bleeding with abdominal pain. ANESTHESIA: Fentanyl 100 mcg and 5 mg of IV Versed. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position. Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place. After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty. With swallowing, the scope was advanced down the esophagus into the body of the stomach. The scope was further advanced down to the antrum and through the pylorus into the duodenum, which was visualized into its second portion. It appeared free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration. Samples were obtained from the antrum and prepyloric area to check for Helicobacter, rapid urease, and additional samples were sent to pathology. Retroflexion view of the fundus of the stomach was normal without evidence of a hiatal hernia. The scope was then slowly removed. The distal esophagus appeared benign with a normal-appearing gastroesophageal sphincter and no esophagitis. The remaining portion of the esophagus was normal. IMPRESSION: Abdominal pain. Symptoms most consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease without endoscopic evidence of hiatal hernia. RECOMMENDATIONS: Await results of CLO testing and biopsies. Return to clinic with Dr. Spencer in 2 weeks for further discussion.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Endoscopy  \n**Reason for the procedure:** Intermittent rectal bleeding and abdominal pain.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** The patient received 100 mcg of fentanyl and 5 mg of IV Versed.  \n\n**What was done:**  \nThe patient was taken to the GI lab and lay on their left side. We monitored their oxygen level and blood pressure continuously. After the patient gave consent, we gently inserted a video scope through the mouth. The scope moved down the esophagus into the stomach, then into the lower part of the stomach (antrum) and past the pylorus into the first part of the duodenum. The duodenum looked normal—no narrowing, tumors, or ulcers. We took tissue samples from the antrum and the area just before the pylorus to test for Helicobacter and other conditions, and sent extra samples to pathology. We also looked at the top part of the stomach (fundus) in a backward view; it was normal and there was no hiatal hernia. The scope was then removed slowly. The lower esophagus looked normal, with a healthy gastroesophageal sphincter and no inflammation. The rest of the esophagus was also normal.  \n\n**Findings:** The abdominal pain is most likely due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, even though we did not see a hiatal hernia on the scope.  \n\n**Next steps:** Wait for the results of the CLO test and the biopsy samples. Schedule a follow‑up appointment with Dr. Spencer in two weeks to discuss the results."
