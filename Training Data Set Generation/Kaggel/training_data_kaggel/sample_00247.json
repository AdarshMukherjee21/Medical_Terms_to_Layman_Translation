Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression, C5-C6. 2. Anterior cervical fusion, C5-C6. 3. Anterior cervical instrumentation, C5-C6. 4. Allograft C5-C6. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. PATIENT STATUS: Taken to recovery room in stable condition. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 36-year-old female who has had severe, recalcitrant right upper extremity pain, numbness, tingling, shoulder pain, axial neck pain, and headaches for many months. Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested. We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options. Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed. She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery. Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively. SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite. General anesthetic was administered. The patient was placed in the supine position. All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated. The patient was noted to have pulse in this position. Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision. Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed. The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease. Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected. Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally. This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split. Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels. Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures. Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur. A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc. Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally. Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace. High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion. Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura. No further evidence of compression was identified. Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam. Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently. Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set. An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit. This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit. The graft was stable to pull-out forces. Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws. Plate and screws were then locked to the plate. Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft. Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline. Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl. Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma. Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin. A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure. The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications. All needle and sponge counts were correct. Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.",

Slipped disc at C5‑C6.  \n2. Neck bone wear at C5‑C6.  \n\nPROCEDURES  \n1. Removal of the disc from the front of the neck at C5‑C6.  \n2. Fusion (joining) of the C5 and C6 vertebrae at C5‑C6.  \n3. Placement of metal hardware to hold the bones together at C5‑C6.  \n4. Insertion of donor bone at C5‑C6.  \n\nANESTHESIA  \nGeneral anesthesia with a breathing tube.  \n\nCOMPLICATIONS  \nNone.  \n\nPATIENT STATUS  \nTaken to the recovery room in stable condition.  \n\nINDICATIONS  \nThe patient is a 36‑year‑old woman who has had severe, stubborn pain, numbness, tingling, shoulder pain, neck pain, and headaches for many months. Non‑surgical treatments did not help, so she asked for surgery. We discussed the possible risks, benefits, and other treatment options. She was told about bleeding, nerve or blood vessel injury, infection, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, damage to nearby spinal segments, pain that might not improve, fusion that might fail, and the chance of needing more surgery. She understood these risks and decided that surgery was the best way to manage her symptoms.  \n\nSUMMARY OF SURGERY  \nAfter the patient gave informed consent and received antibiotics before the operation, she was taken to the operating room. She was put under general anesthesia and laid flat on her back. A breathing tube was placed, and a ten‑pound traction device was attached to her skull to help straighten the neck. The surgical team cleaned and covered the area with sterile drapes. A small angled cut was made in the skin just above the C6 vertebra. The tissue was cut through until the muscle that runs along the side of the neck (omohyoid) was reached and cut. The surgeon carefully moved the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (food pipe) to the side, keeping the carotid artery and its surrounding tissues safe. The front layer of tissue covering the spine (prevertebral fascia) was split. A quick X‑ray confirmed the correct levels. The longus colli muscle was gently moved aside so a special retractor could be placed behind it without pulling on vital structures.  \n\nThe bone spurs on the lower side were removed with a high‑speed drill. The slipped disc was taken out with a scalpel and curette. The surgeon cleared the space behind the disc and the ligament that runs along the spine, removing the disc material from the right side of the space. The bone at the bottom of the space was ground down to healthy bleeding bone to prepare for fusion. A curette and a ball‑tip tool were used to clean the area around the spinal cord. No additional compression was found. Bleeding was stopped with a thrombin‑soaked sponge.  \n\nThe space between the vertebrae was gently pulled apart with a Caspar pin distraction set. An 8‑mm donor bone piece was placed into the space and secured with a bone‑binding matrix and a tamp to make a tight fit. The graft was stable. The distraction was removed, and a metal plate (DePuy Trimline) with 14‑mm self‑drilling screws was attached to the front of the spine. The screws were locked to the plate. Final X‑rays showed the plate in the right position, good spacing between the vertebrae, and the donor bone in place.  \n\nThe wound was washed thoroughly with normal saline. The cut omohyoid muscle was stitched with 3‑0 Vicryl. The platysma muscle was closed with running 3‑0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch (Monocryl) and Steri‑Strips. A deep drain was placed before closing. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no complications during the operation. All counts of needles and sponges were correct. Neurologic monitoring was normal throughout the surgery."
