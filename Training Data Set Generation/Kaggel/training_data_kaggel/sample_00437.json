  "medical": "EXAM: Five views of the right knee. HISTORY: Pain. The patient is status-post surgery, he could not straighten his leg, pain in the back of the knee. TECHNIQUE: Five views of the right knee were evaluated. There are no priors for comparison. FINDINGS: Five views of the right knee were evaluated and they reveal there is no evidence of any displaced fractures, dislocations, or subluxations. There are multiple areas of growth arrest lines seen in the distal aspect of the femur and proximal aspect of the tibia. There is also appearance of a high-riding patella suggestive of patella alta. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of any displaced fractures, dislocations, or subluxations. 2. Growth arrest lines seen in the distal femur and proximal tibia. 3. Questionable appearance of a slightly high-riding patella, possibly suggesting patella alta.",
  "layman": "EXAM: X‑rays of the right knee from five angles.  \nHISTORY: The patient had surgery and can’t straighten the leg. He has pain at the back of the knee.  \nTECHNIQUE: The five X‑rays were reviewed. There are no previous images to compare with.  \nFINDINGS: The X‑rays show no broken bones that are displaced, no dislocations, and no partial displacements. There are several lines in the lower part of the thigh bone and the upper part of the shin bone that suggest growth has stopped in those areas. The kneecap looks a little higher than normal, which may indicate patella alta.  \nIMPRESSION:  \n1. No displaced fractures, dislocations, or partial displacements.  \n2. Growth‑stop lines in the lower thigh bone and upper shin bone.  \n3. The kneecap appears slightly high, possibly indicating patella alta."
