  "medical": "HISTORY: This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures. BACKGROUND ACTIVITY: The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region. ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality. SLEEP PATTERNS: No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing. IMPRESSION: This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.",
  "layman": "**History:** A digital EEG was done on a 75‑year‑old man who has seizures.\n\n**Background activity:** The main rhythm on the EEG is 8‑9 Hz coming from the back of the head. Some beta waves (higher frequency) appear only occasionally. There are also muscle‑related waves at 4‑5 Hz, which could indicate Parkinson’s disease. These muscle waves make part of the EEG hard to read. Occasionally, sharp waves appear in the left temporal area. At one point, the right frontal area of the head shows slowing of the waves.\n\n**Activation procedures:** Light flickering (photic stimulation) was used and did not show any abnormal changes.\n\n**Sleep patterns:** No sleep stages were seen during this recording.\n\n**Impression:** The EEG, taken while the patient was awake, alert, or drowsy, is abnormal. The abnormalities are:\n- Slowing in the right frontal area, which could mean a structural problem such as a stroke or a subdural hematoma.\n- Sharp waves in the left temporal area, which could lead to seizures or also suggest a structural issue.\n- Tremor‑related waves that likely reflect Parkinson’s disease.\n\nBecause of these findings, it is recommended to check for any structural brain problems and to follow up clinically."
