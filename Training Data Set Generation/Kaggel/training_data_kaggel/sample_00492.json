  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: 1. Angina. 2. Coronary artery disease. INTERPRETATION: This is a technically acceptable study. DIMENSIONS: Anterior septal wall 1.2, posterior wall 1.2, left ventricular end diastolic 6.0, end systolic 4.7. The left atrium is 3.9. FINDINGS: Left atrium was mildly to moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi were seen. The left ventricle was mildly dilated with mainly global hypokinesis, more prominent in the inferior septum and inferoposterior wall. The EF was moderately reduced with estimated EF of 40% with near normal thickening. The right atrium was mildly dilated. The right ventricle was normal in size. Mitral valve showed to be structurally normal with no prolapse or vegetation. There was mild mitral regurgitation on color flow interrogation. The mitral inflow pattern was consistent with pseudonormalization or grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. The aortic valve appeared to be structurally normal. Normal peak velocity. No significant AI. Pulmonic valve showed mild PI. Tricuspid valve showed mild tricuspid regurgitation. Based on which, the right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be mildly elevated at 40 to 45 mmHg. Anterior septum appeared to be intact. No pericardial effusion was seen. CONCLUSION: 1. Mild biatrial enlargement. 2. Normal thickening of the left ventricle with mildly dilated ventricle and EF of 40%. 3. Mild mitral regurgitation. 4. Diastolic dysfunction grade 2. 5. Mild pulmonary hypertension.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam**  \n1. Chest pain (angina).  \n2. Coronary artery disease.  \n\n**Interpretation**  \nThe study was done correctly.  \n\n**Measurements**  \n- Front wall of the heart: 1.2 cm  \n- Back wall: 1.2 cm  \n- Left ventricle when relaxed: 6.0 cm  \n- Left ventricle when pumping: 4.7 cm  \n- Left atrium: 3.9 cm  \n\n**Findings**  \n- The left atrium is a little to moderately enlarged.  \n- No tumors or blood clots were seen.  \n- The left ventricle is a little enlarged and its muscle moves a bit less than normal, especially in the lower front and lower back parts.  \n- The heart’s pumping ability (ejection fraction) is moderately low at about 40 %. The muscle thickness is near normal.  \n- The right atrium is also a little enlarged.  \n- The right ventricle is a normal size.  \n- The mitral valve (between left atrium and ventricle) looks normal in shape, with no bulging or growths. There is a small amount of blood leaking back (mild mitral regurgitation). The flow pattern suggests a mild to moderate problem with the heart’s relaxation (diastolic dysfunction grade 2).  \n- The aortic valve (between left ventricle and aorta) looks normal, with normal blood speed and no significant backflow.  \n- The pulmonary valve shows a mild amount of backflow.  \n- The tricuspid valve (between right atrium and ventricle) shows a mild leak.  \n- The estimated pressure in the right ventricle is slightly high at 40–45 mmHg.  \n- The front wall of the heart is intact.  \n- No fluid around the heart.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \n1. Mild enlargement of both atria.  \n2. Normal muscle thickness of the left ventricle, but the ventricle is a little enlarged and pumps at about 40 %.  \n3. Mild mitral valve leak.  \n4. Mild to moderate diastolic dysfunction (grade 2).  \n5. Mild pulmonary hypertension."
