  "medical": "CC: Headache HX: 37 y/o RHF presented to her local physician with a one month history of intermittent predominantly left occipital headaches which were awakening her in the early morning hours. The headachese were dull to throbbing in character. She was initially treated with Parafon-forte for tension type headaches, but the pain did not resolve. She subsequently underwent HCT in early 12/90 which revealed a right frontal mass lesion. PMH: 1)s/p tonsillectomy. 2)s/p elective abortion. FHX: Mother with breast CA, MA with &quot;bone cancer.&quot; AODM both sides of family. SHX: Denied tobacco or illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH. Married with 2 teenage children. EXAM: VItal signs unremarkable. MS: Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Lucid thought process per NSG note. CN: unremarkable. Motor: full strength with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: unremarkable. Coordination: unremarkable. Station/Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: unremarkable. Gen. Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: MRI Brain: large solid and cystic right frontal lobe mass with a large amount of surrounding edema. There is apparent tumor extension into the corpus callosum across the midline. Tumor extension is also suggested in the anterior limb of the interanl capsule on the right. There is midline mass shift to the left with effacement of the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. The MRI findings are most consistent with glioblastoma. The patient underwent right frontal lobectomy. The pathological diagnosis was xanthomatous astrocytoma. The literature at the time was not clear as to optimal treatment protocol. People have survived as long as 25 years after diagnosis with this type of tumor. XRT was deferred until 11/91 when an MRI and PET Scan suggested extension of the tumor. She then received 5580 cGy of XRT in divided segments. She developed olfactory auras shortly after lobectomy at was treated with PB with subsequent improvement. She was treated with BCNU chemotherapy protocol in 1992.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Headache  \n**History:** A 37‑year‑old woman with right‑hand heart failure came to her local doctor because she had been having headaches for about a month. The pain was mostly in the back of her left head and would wake her up early in the morning. The headaches were dull to throbbing. She first took a medication called Parafon‑forte for tension headaches, but it didn’t help. In early December 1990 she had a brain scan (HCT) that found a mass on the right side of her frontal lobe.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. Tonsil removal surgery.  \n2. Elective abortion.  \n\n**Family history:** Mother had breast cancer; a relative had “bone cancer.” Cancer runs in both sides of the family.  \n\n**Social history:** She does not smoke or use illegal drugs. She drinks alcohol only rarely. She is married and has two teenage children.  \n\n**Exam:**  \n- Vital signs normal.  \n- She is alert and knows who she is, where she is, and the time.  \n- Her thoughts are clear.  \n- No problems with her nerves.  \n- Muscle strength, size, and tone are normal.  \n- Sensation is normal.  \n- Coordination is normal.  \n- Walking and balance are normal.  \n- Reflexes are normal.  \n- General exam shows no abnormalities.  \n\n**Course:**  \nAn MRI of her brain showed a large solid and cystic tumor in the right frontal lobe with a lot of swelling around it. The tumor had spread into the corpus callosum (the bridge between the two brain halves) and also seemed to involve the right side of the internal capsule. The mass pushed the brain’s midline to the left and squeezed the front part of the right lateral ventricle. These findings most closely match a glioblastoma.  \n\nShe had surgery to remove the tumor from the right frontal lobe. The pathology report called it a xanthomatous astrocytoma. At that time doctors were not sure what the best treatment was. Some people have lived up to 25 years after being diagnosed with this type of tumor.  \n\nRadiation therapy was delayed until November 1991, when another MRI and PET scan showed the tumor had grown again. She then received 5,580 cGy of radiation in several parts. Shortly after the surgery she started having smells that weren’t there (olfactory auras); she was treated with phenobarbital, which helped. In 1992 she received BCNU chemotherapy."
