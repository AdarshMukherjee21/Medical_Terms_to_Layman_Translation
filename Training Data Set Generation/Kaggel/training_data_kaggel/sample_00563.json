  "medical": "DIAGNOSIS: Left knee osteoarthritis. HISTORY: The patient is a 58-year-old female, referred to therapy due to left knee osteoarthritis. The patient states that approximately 2 years ago, she fell to the ground and thereafter had blood clots in the knee area. The patient was transferred from the hospital to a nursing home and lived there for 1 year. Prior to this incident, the patient was ambulating independently with a pickup walker throughout her home. Since that time, the patient has only been performing transverse and has been unable to ambulate. The patient states that her primary concern is her left knee pain and they desire to walk short distances again in her home. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: High blood pressure, obesity, right patellar fracture with pin in 1990, and history of blood clots. MEDICATIONS: Naproxen, Plavix, and stool softener. MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS: The patient states that she had an x-ray of the knee in 2007 and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis. SUBJECTIVE: The patient reports that when seated and at rest, her knee pain is 0/10. The patient states that with active motion of the left knee, the pain in the anterior portion increases to 5/10. PATIENT'S GOAL: To transfer better and walk 5 feet from her bed to the couch. INSPECTION: The right knee has a large 8-inch long and very wide tight scar with adhesions to the underlying connective tissue due to her patellar fracture and surgery following an MVA in 1990, bilateral knees are very large due to obesity. There are no scars, bruising or increased temperature noted in the left knee. RANGE OF MOTION: Active and passive range of motion of the right knee is 0 to 90 degrees and the left knee, 0 to 85 degrees. Pain is elicited during active range of motion of the left knee. PALPATION: Palpation to the left knee elicits pain around the patellar tendon and to each side of this area. FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY: The patient reports that she transfers with standby to contact-guard assist in the home from her bed to her wheelchair and return. The patient is able to stand modified independent from wheelchair level and tolerates at least 15 seconds of standing prior to needing to sit down due to the left knee pain. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 58-year-old female with left knee osteoarthritis. Examination indicates deficits in pain, muscle endurance, and functional mobility. The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy to address these impairments. TREATMENT PLAN: The patient will be seen two times per week for an initial 4 weeks with re-assessment at that time for an additional 4 weeks if needed. INTERVENTIONS INCLUDE: 1. Modalities including electrical stimulation, ultrasound, heat, and ice. 2. Therapeutic exercise. 3. Functional mobility training. 4. Gait training. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED IN 4 WEEKS: 1. The patient is to have increased endurance in bilateral lower extremities as demonstrated by being able to perform 20 repetitions of all lower extremity exercises in seated and supine positions with minimum 2-pound weight. 2. The patient is to perform standby assist transfer using a pickup walker. 3. The patient is to demonstrate 4 steps of ambulation using forward and backward using a pickup walker or front-wheeled walker. 4. The patient is to report maximum 3/10 pain with weightbearing of 2 minutes in the left knee. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED IN 8 WEEKS: 1. The patient is to be independent with the home exercise program. 2. The patient is to tolerate 20 reps of standing exercises with pain maximum of 3/10. 3. The patient is to ambulate 20 feet with the most appropriate assistive device. PROGNOSIS TO THE ABOVE-STATED GOALS: Fair to good. The above treatment plan has been discussed with the patient. She is in agreement.",

About two years ago she fell and then developed blood clots around her knee. She was moved from the hospital to a nursing home and stayed there for one year. Before the fall she could walk around her house with a pickup walker. Since then she has only been able to move her legs in place and cannot walk. Her main worry is the pain in her left knee and she wants to walk short distances again at home.  \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: High blood pressure, obesity, a right knee fracture with a pin in 1990, and a history of blood clots.  \n\nMEDICATIONS: Naproxen, Plavix, and a stool softener.  \n\nMEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS: She had a knee X‑ray in 2007 that showed osteoarthritis.  \n\nSUBJECTIVE: When she is sitting or resting, her knee pain is 0/10.

Both knees are large because of her obesity. There are no scars, bruises, or warmth on the left knee.  \n\nRANGE OF MOTION: The right knee can move from 0 to 90 degrees, and the left knee from 0 to 85 degrees. Moving the left knee hurts.  \n\nPALPATION: Pressing on the left knee hurts around the patellar tendon and on both sides of it.  \n\nFUNCTIONAL MOBILITY: She uses a standby contact‑guard assist at home to get from her bed to her wheelchair and back. She can stand from the wheelchair with some help and can stand for at least 15 seconds before the left knee pain forces her to sit.  \n\nASSESSMENT: She is a 58‑year‑old woman with left knee osteoarthritis. She has pain, weak muscles, and limited mobility. Skilled physical therapy can help her.  \n\nTREATMENT PLAN: She will see a therapist twice a week for the first 4 weeks. After that, she will be reassessed and may continue for another 4 weeks if needed.  \n\nINTERVENTIONS INCLUDE:  \n1. Modalities such as electrical stimulation, ultrasound, heat, and ice.  \n2. Therapeutic exercise.  \n3. Functional mobility training.  \n4. Gait training.  \n\nLONG‑TERM GOALS IN 4 WEEKS:  \n1. She should be able to do 20 repetitions of all lower‑body exercises in seated and lying positions with at least a 2‑pound weight.  \n2. She should use a pickup walker for standby assist transfers.  \n3. She should walk 4 steps forward and backward with a pickup or front‑wheeled walker.  \n4. She should report no more than 3/10 pain when standing for 2 minutes on the left knee.  \n\nLONG‑TERM GOALS IN 8 WEEKS:  \n1. She should be able to do the home exercise program on her own.  \n2. She should do 20 repetitions of standing exercises with pain no more than 3/10.  \n3. She should walk 20 feet with the best assistive device.  \n\nPROGNOSIS: Fair to good.
