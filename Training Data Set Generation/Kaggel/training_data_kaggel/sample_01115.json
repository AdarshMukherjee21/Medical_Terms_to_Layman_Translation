  "medical": "CC: BLE weakness. HX: This 82y/o RHM was referred to the Neurology service by the Neurosurgery service for evaluation of acute onset paraplegia. He was in his usual state of health until 5:30PM on 4/6/95, when he developed sudden &quot;pressure-like&quot; epigastric discomfort associated with bilateral lower extremity weakness, SOB, lightheadedness and diaphoresis. He knelt down to the floor and &quot;went to sleep.&quot; The Emergency Medical Service was alert and arrived within minutes, at which time he was easily aroused though unable to move or feel his lower extremities. No associated upper extremity or bulbar dysfunction was noted. He was taken to a local hospital where an INR was found to be 9.1. He was given vitamin K 15mg, and transferred to UIHC to rule out spinal epidural hemorrhage. An MRI scan of the T-spine was obtained and the preliminary reading was &quot;normal.&quot; The Neurology service was then asked to evaluate the patient. MEDS: Coumadin 2mg qd, Digoxin 0.25mg qd, Prazosin 2mg qd. PMH: 1)HTN. 2)A-Fib on coumadin. 3)Peripheral vascular disease:s/p left Femoral-popliteal bypass (8/94) and graft thrombosis-thrombolisis (9/94). 4)Adenocarcinoma of the prostate: s/p TURP (1992). FHX: unremarkable. SHX: Farmer, Married, no Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP165/60 HR86 RR18 34.2C SAO2 98% on room air. MS: A&O to person, place, time. In no acute distress. Lucid. CN: unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength in BUE. Flaccid paraplegia in BLE Sensory: T6 sensory level to LT/PP, bilaterally. Decreased vibratory sense in BLE in a stocking distribution, distally. Coord: Intact FNF and RAM in BUE. Unable to do HKS. Station: no pronator drift. Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE, Absent in BLE, plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Rectal: decreased rectal tone. GEN EXAM: No carotid bruitts. Lungs: bibasilar crackles. CV: Irregular rate and rhythm with soft diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdomen: flat, soft, non-tender without bruitt or pulsatile mass. Distal pulses were strong in all extremities. COURSE: Hgb 12.6, Hct 40%, WBC 11.7, Plt 154k, INR 7.6, PTT 50, CK 41, the GS was normal. EKG showed A-Fib at 75BPM with competing junctional pacemaker, essentially unchanged from 9/12/94. It was suspected that the patient sustained an anterior-cervico-thoracic spinal cord infarction with resultant paraplegia and T6 sensory level. A CXR was done in the ER prior to admission. This revealed cardiomegaly and a widened mediastinum. He returned from the x-ray suite and suddenly became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitative measures failed. Pericardiocentesis was unremarkable. Autopsy revealed a massive aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the origin of the iliac arteries with extensive pericardial hematoma. The dissection was seen in retrospect on the MRI T-spine.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Weakness in both legs.  \n\n**History:**  \nAn 82‑year‑old man with a history of high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin), peripheral vascular disease, and prostate cancer (treated in 1992) was seen by neurosurgery for sudden paralysis of his legs. He was fine until about 5:30 p.m. on April 6, 1995, when he suddenly felt a “pressure‑like” pain in his upper belly and had weakness in both legs, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and sweating. He knelt down and “fell asleep.” Emergency responders arrived quickly. He could be woken up but could not move or feel his legs. His arms were fine. He was taken to a local hospital where his blood clotting test (INR) was 9.1. He was given vitamin K and sent to the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics (UIHC) to rule out a spinal bleed. An MRI of his thoracic spine looked normal at first. Neurology was then asked to evaluate him.  \n\n**Medications:**  \n- Coumadin 2 mg daily  \n- Digoxin 0.25 mg daily  \n- Prazosin 2 mg daily  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1. High blood pressure  \n2. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin  \n3. Peripheral vascular disease – had a left femoral‑popliteal bypass in August 1994 and a graft clot that was treated with clot‑breaking therapy in September 1994  \n4. Prostate cancer – had a transurethral resection of the prostate in 1992  \n\n**Family History:** Unremarkable.  \n**Social History:** Farmer, married, does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs.  \n\n**Physical Exam (at UIHC):**  \n- Blood pressure 165/60 mm Hg, heart rate 86 bpm, breathing 18 /min, temperature 34.2 °C, oxygen 98 % on room air.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time; not in acute distress; clear‑talking.  \n- Cranial nerves normal.  \n- Arms: 5/5 strength.  \n- Legs: flaccid paralysis (no movement).  \n- Sensation: loss of feeling below the T6 level (upper chest) on both sides; vibration sense reduced in a stocking‑like pattern in the legs.  \n- Coordination: fine hand movements and rapid alternating movements in arms were fine; could not do heel‑to‑toe test.  \n- Reflexes: normal in arms, absent in legs; plantar reflexes (foot) were normal.  \n- Rectal tone decreased.  \n- No carotid bruits.  \n- Lungs: crackles at the bases.  \n- Heart: irregular rhythm, soft diastolic murmur at the left sternal border.  \n- Abdomen: flat, soft, no tenderness or masses; pulses strong in all limbs.  \n\n**Laboratory Results:**  \n- Hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit 40 %, white cells 11.7 k/µL, platelets 154 k/µL.  \n- INR 7.6, PTT 50 s, CK 41 U/L.  \n- Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation at 75 bpm with a competing junctional pacemaker, unchanged from 1994.  \n\n**Course:**  \nDoctors suspected an anterior spinal cord stroke in the cervical‑thoracic area causing the leg paralysis and T6 sensory loss. A chest X‑ray taken in the emergency room before admission showed an enlarged heart and a widened mediastinum. After the X‑ray, the patient suddenly became unresponsive and stopped breathing and beating. CPR and other emergency measures did not revive him. A needle drainage of the pericardial sac (pericardiocentesis) was normal.  \n\n**Autopsy Findings:**  \nA large tear in the aorta (aortic dissection) ran from the aortic root all the way to the start of the iliac arteries, with a large blood collection around the heart. The tear could be seen on the earlier spinal MRI when it was looked at again."
