  "medical": "EXAM: Ultrasound left lower extremity, duplex venous REASON FOR EXAM: Swelling and rule out DVT. FINDINGS: Duplex and color Doppler interrogation of the left lower extremity deep venous system was performed. Compressibility, augmentation, and color flow as well as Doppler flow was demonstrated within the common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and popliteal vein. The posterior tibial vein also demonstrated flow along its proximal visualized extent. IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Ultrasound of the left leg, checking for blood clots\n\nREASON FOR EXAM: Swelling in the leg; want to see if there is a deep vein clot (DVT).\n\nFINDINGS: We used a duplex ultrasound and color Doppler to look at the deep veins in the left leg. The common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and popliteal vein all showed normal compressibility, good blood flow, and Doppler signals. The posterior tibial vein also had normal flow where we could see it.\n\nIMPRESSION: No signs of a deep vein clot in the left leg."
