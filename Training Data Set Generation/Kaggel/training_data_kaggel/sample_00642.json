  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hip osteoarthritis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hip osteoarthritis. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Total hip replacement on the right side using the following components: 1. Zimmer trilogy acetabular system 10-degree elevated rim located at the 12 o'clock position. 2. Trabecular metal modular acetabular system 48 mm in diameter. 3. Femoral head 32 mm diameter +0 mm neck length. 4. Alloclassic SL offset stem uncemented for taper. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the operating room and was placed on the operative table in a lateral decubitus position with the right side up. After review of allergies, antibiotics were administered and time out was performed. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A 15 cm to 25 cm in length, an incision was made over the greater trochanter. This was angled posteriorly. Access to the tensor fascia lata was performed. This was incised with the use of scissors. Gluteus maximus was separated. The bursa around the hip was identified, and the bleeders were coagulated with the use of Bovie. Hemostasis was achieved. The piriformis fossa was identified, and the piriformis fossa tendon was elevated with the use of a Cobb. It was detached from the piriformis fossa and tagged with 2-0 Vicryl. Access to the capsule was performed. The capsule was excised from the posterior and superior aspects. It was released also in the front with the use of a Mayo scissors. The hip was then dislocated. With the use of an oscillating saw, the femoral neck cut was performed. The acetabulum was then visualized and debrided from soft tissues and osteophytes. Reaming was initiated and completed for a 48 mm diameter cap without complications. The trial component was put in place and was found to be stable in an anatomic position. The actual component was then impacted in the acetabulum. A 10-degree lip polyethylene was also placed in the acetabular cap. Our attention was then focused to the femur. With the use of a cookie cutter, the femoral canal was accessed. The broaching process was initiated for No.4 trial component. Trialing of the hip with the hip flexed at 90 degrees and internally rotated to 30 degrees did not demonstrate any obvious instability or dislocation. In addition, in full extension and external rotation, there was no dislocation. The actual component was inserted in place and hemostasis was achieved again. The wound was irrigated with normal saline. The wound was then closed in layers. Before performing that the medium-sized Hemovac drain was placed in the wound. The tensor fascia lata was closed with 0 PDS and the wound was closed with 2-0 Monocryl. Staples were used for the skin. The patient recovered from anesthesia without complications. EBL: 50 mL. IV FLUIDS: 2 liters. DRAINS: One medium-sized Hemovac. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. She will be weightbearing as tolerated to the right lower extremity with posterior hip precautions. We will start the DVT prophylaxis after the removal of the epidural catheter.",

Zimmer Trilogy acetabular system with a 10‑degree raised rim at the top.  \n2. Trabecular metal modular acetabular system, 48 mm in diameter.  \n3. 32 mm femoral head with a neck length of 0 mm.  \n4. Uncemented Alloclassic SL offset stem for the femur.  \n\n**Anesthesia:** Spinal.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the table on her side with the right side up. After checking for allergies, antibiotics were given and a “time‑out” was done. The right leg was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A 15‑ to 25‑cm incision was made over the greater trochanter, angled toward the back. The tensor fascia lata was exposed and cut with scissors. The gluteus maximus muscle was separated. The bursa around the hip was found and any bleeding was stopped with a cautery device. Blood flow was controlled. The piriformis fossa was located, and its tendon was lifted with a Cobb elevator, then cut and tied with 2‑0 Vicryl suture. The joint capsule was cut from the back and top, and also from the front with Mayo scissors. The hip was then dislocated. An oscillating saw was used to cut the femoral neck. The acetabulum (hip socket) was cleaned of soft tissue and bone spurs. Reaming was done to fit a 48‑mm cup, with no problems. A trial cup was placed and found to be stable in the correct position. The final cup was then pressed into the acetabulum. A 10‑degree lip polyethylene liner was also placed in the cup.  \n\nAttention then turned to the femur. A cookie‑cutter tool accessed the femoral canal. Broaching was started for the No. 4 trial component. The hip was tested with 90° flexion and 30° internal rotation; it was stable. In full extension and external rotation, it also stayed in place. The final femoral component was inserted. Blood flow was checked again. The wound was washed with normal saline. Layers of the wound were closed. A medium‑sized Hemovac drain was placed before closing. The tensor fascia lata was closed with 0 PDS, the rest of the wound with 2‑0 Monocryl, and skin staples were used.  \n\nThe patient woke up from anesthesia without problems.  \n**Estimated blood loss:** 50 mL.  \n**IV fluids given:** 2 L.  \n**Drain:** One medium‑sized Hemovac.  \n**Complications:** None.  \n\n**Disposition:** The patient was moved to the post‑anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition. She can bear weight on the right leg as tolerated, but must keep the hip protected (posterior precautions). DVT prevention will start after the epidural catheter is removed."
