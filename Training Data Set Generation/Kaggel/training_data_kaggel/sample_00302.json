In addition, she felt spoke as though she &quot;was drunk.&quot; Nevertheless, she was able to comprehend what was being spoken around her. Her difficulty with speech completely resolved by 12:00 noon. She was brought to UIHC ETC at 8:30AM on 11/23/92 for evaluation. MEDS: none. ALLERGIES: ASA/ PCN both cause rash. PMH: 1)?HTN. 2)COPD. 3)h/o hepatitis (unknown type). 4)Macular degeneration. SHX: Widowed; lives alone. Denied ETOH/Tobacco/illicit drug use. FHX: unremarkable. EXAM: BP191/89 HR68 RR16 37.2C MS: A & O to person, place and time. Speech fluent; without dysarthria. Intact naming, comprehension, and repetition. CN: Central scotoma, OS (old). Mild upper lid ptosis, OD (old per picture). Lower left facial weakness. Motor: Mild Left hemiparesis (4+ to 5- strength throughout affected side). No mention of muscle tone in chart. Sensory: unremarkable. Coord: impaired FNF and HKS movement secondary to weakness. Station: Left pronator drift. No Romberg sign seen. Gait: Left hemiparetic gait with decreased LUE swing. Reflexes: 3/3+ biceps and triceps. 3/3+ patellae. 2/3+ ankles with 3-4beats of non-sustained ankle clonus on left. Plantars: Left babinski sign; and flexor on right. General Exam: 2/6 SEM at left sternal border. COURSE: GS, CBC, PT, PTT, CK, ESR were within normal limits. ABC 7.4/46/63 on room air. EKG showed a sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block. MRI brain, 11/23/95, revealed a right pontine pyramidal tract infarction. She was treated with Ticlopidine 250mg bid. On 11/26/92, her left hemiparesis worsened. A HCT, 11/27/92, was unremarkable. The patient was treated with IV Heparin. This was discontinued the following day when her strength returned to that noted on 11/23/95. On 11/27/92, she developed angina and was ruled out for MI by serial EKG and cardiac enzyme studies. Carotid duplex showed 0-15% bilateral ICA stenosis and antegrade vertebral artery flow bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed aortic insufficiency only. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, aortic valvular fibrosis. There was calcification and possible thrombus seen in the descending aorta. Cardiology did not feel the later was an indication for anticoagulation. She was discharged home on Isordil 20 tid, Metoprolol 25mg q12hours, and Ticlid 250mg bid.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Weakness on the left side of her body.  \n\n**History:** A 74‑year‑old woman with a history of right‑hand heart failure woke up from a nap at 11:00 AM on November 22, 1992. She felt weak on her left side and needed help walking on that side. She also felt as if she were “drunk,” but she could understand what people were saying. Her speech problems disappeared by noon. She was taken to the University of Illinois Hospital Emergency Treatment Center at 8:30 AM on November 23, 1992 for evaluation.  \n\n**Medications:** None.  \n**Allergies:** Rash with aspirin and penicillin.  \n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. High blood pressure  \n2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  \n3. History of hepatitis (type unknown)  \n4. Macular degeneration  \n\n**Social history:** Widowed, lives alone. She does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illegal drugs.  \n\n**Family history:** Unremarkable.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 191/89 mm Hg, heart rate 68 bpm, breathing 16 breaths/min, temperature 37.2 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  \n- Speech fluent, no slurred speech. She could name, understand, and repeat words.  \n- Vision: a central blind spot in the left eye (old). Mild drooping of the upper eyelid on the right (old).  \n- Facial weakness on the lower left side.  \n- Muscle strength: mild weakness on the left side (4+ to 5‑ on a scale of 0‑5). No mention of muscle tone.  \n- Sensation: normal.  \n- Coordination: difficulty with finger‑to‑nose and heel‑to‑shin tests on the left because of weakness.  \n- Left arm drift when standing. No balance problems.  \n- Walking: left‑side weakness, left arm swings less.  \n- Reflexes: normal in arms and knees; ankles a little brisk with brief clonus on the left.  \n- Plantar reflex: Babinski sign on the left, normal on the right.  \n- Heart: a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  \n\n**Course:**  \n- Blood tests (complete blood count, clotting studies, creatine kinase, ESR) were normal.  \n- Blood gases: pH 7.4, PaCO₂ 46 mm Hg, PaO₂ 63 mm Hg on room air.  \n- ECG showed normal rhythm with a right bundle‑branch block.  \n- MRI of the brain on November 23, 1995 showed a small stroke in the right side of the brainstem (pontine pyramidal tract).  \n- She was started on ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily.  \n- On November 26, 1992 her left‑side weakness got worse. A head CT on November 27, 1992 was normal. She received IV heparin, which was stopped the next day when her strength returned to the level seen on November 23, 1995.  \n- On November 27, 1992 she had chest pain; serial ECGs and heart enzyme tests ruled out a heart attack.  \n- Carotid ultrasound showed 0‑15 % narrowing of both internal carotid arteries and normal flow in the vertebral arteries.  \n- A transthoracic echo showed only aortic valve leakage.  \n- A transesophageal echo showed minor leaking of the mitral and tricuspid valves, aortic valve scarring, and some calcium and possible clot in the descending aorta. Cardiology decided this did not need blood thinners.  \n\n**Discharge medications:** Isordil 20 mg three times a day, metoprolol 25 mg twice a day, and ticlopidine 250 mg twice a day."
