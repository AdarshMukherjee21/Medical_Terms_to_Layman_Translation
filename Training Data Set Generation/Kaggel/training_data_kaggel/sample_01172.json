FLUIDS: 1200 cc of crystalloids. URINE OUTPUT: No Foley catheter. SPECIMENS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 50 cc. INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION: This is a case of a very pleasant 38-year-old Caucasian female who has been complaining over the last eight years of neck pain and shoulder pain radiating down across the top of her left shoulder and also across her shoulder blades to the right side, but predominantly down the left upper extremity into the wrist. The patient has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and subsequently, has been treated with pain medications, anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The patient's symptoms continued to persist and subsequently, an MRI of the C-spine was done, which showed disc desiccation, spondylosis and herniated disk at C5-C6, an EMG and CV revealed a presence of mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient is now being recommended to undergo decompression and spinal instrumentation and fusion at C5-C6. The patient understood the risks and benefits of the surgery. Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection. Bleeding can be in the form of soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway for which she can be brought emergently back to the operating room for emergent evacuation of the hematoma as this may cause weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function. This could also result in dural tear with its attendant symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and posterior neck pain as well as the development of pseudomeningocele. Should the symptoms be severe or the pseudomeningocele be large, she can be brought back to the operating room for repair of the CSF leak and evacuation of the pseudomeningocele. There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and nonfusion, for which she may require redo surgery at this level. There is also the possibility of nonimprovement of her symptoms in about 10% of cases. The patient understands this risk on top of the potential injury to the esophagus and trachea as well as the carotid artery. There is also the risk of stroke, should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled into the right cerebral circulation. The patient also understands that there could be hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. She understood these risks on top of the risks of anesthesia and gave her consent for the procedure. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension and the head supported on a foam doughnut. A marker was placed. This verified the level to be at the C5-C6 level and incision was then marked in a transverse fashion starting from the midline extending about 5 mm beyond the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The area was then prepped with DuraPrep after the head was turned 45 degrees to the left. After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and the platysma was cut using a hot knife in a transverse fashion. Dissection was then carried underneath the platysma superiorly inferiorly. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried out lateral to the esophagus to trachea as well as medial to the carotid sheath in the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The prevertebral fascia was noted to be taken her case with a lot of fat deposition. Bipolar coagulation of bleeders was done; however, branch of the superior thyroid artery was ligated with Hemoclips x4. After this was completed, a localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 level. We proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of the C5 and C6. Self-retaining retractor was then laid down. An anterior osteophyte was carefully drilled using a Midas 5-mm bur and the disk together with the inferior endplate of C5 and the superior endplate of C6 was also drilled down with the Midas 5-mm bur. This was later followed with a 3-mm bur and the disk together with posterior longitudinal ligament was removed using Kerrison's ranging from 1 to 4 mm. The herniation was noted on the right. However, there was significant neuroforaminal stenosis on the left. Decompression on both sides was done and after this was completed, a Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. The area was then irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution. A 7 mm implant with its inferior packed with Vitoss was then laid down and secured in place with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws and plate 18 mm, all of which were titanium. X-ray after this placement showed excellent position of all these implants and screws and _____ and the patient's area was also irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution. A round French 10 JP drain was then laid down and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly. The catheter was then anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch and connected to a sterile draining system. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl subcuticular 4-0 Stitch for the dermis, and the wound was reinforced with Dermabond. Dressing was placed only at the exit site of the catheter. C-collar was placed. The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. Neck pain with tingling and weakness in both arms, worse on the left.  \n2. Age‑related wear of the neck bones with a herniated disc at the C5‑C6 level.  \n\n**Post‑operative diagnoses**  \n1. Same neck pain and arm symptoms as before.  \n2. Same cervical wear and herniated disc at C5‑C6.  \n\n**Operative procedures**  \n1. Removed the herniated disc and relieved pressure at C5‑C6.  \n2. Joined the C5 and C6 vertebrae together (fusion).  \n3. Placed a titanium plate (18 mm) and four titanium screws (14 × 4.0 mm) across C5‑C6.  \n4. Inserted a 7 mm PEEK cage.  \n5. Filled the cage with a bone‑graft substitute (Vitoss).  \n\n**Drains** – a round 10 French JP drain was placed.  \n**Fluids** – 1200 cc of crystalloid solution was given.  \n**Urine output** – no Foley catheter was used.  \n**Specimens** – none taken.  \n**Complications** – none.  \n**Anesthesia** – general endotracheal anesthesia.  \n**Estimated blood loss** – less than 50 cc.  \n\n**Indications for the operation**  \nA 38‑year‑old woman had been dealing with neck and shoulder pain for eight years. The pain radiated from her left shoulder, across the shoulder blades, and down her left arm to the wrist. She had been treated for fibromyalgia with pain medicines, anti‑inflammatories, and muscle relaxants, but the symptoms persisted. An MRI showed disc dehydration, bone wear, and a herniated disc at C5‑C6. An EMG and nerve conduction study revealed mild‑to‑moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. She was advised to have a decompression, fusion, and instrumentation at C5‑C6. She understood the risks and benefits, including possible bleeding, infection, nerve injury, and the need for possible future surgery if the fusion does not heal. She gave informed consent.  \n\n**Description of the procedure**  \nThe patient was awake, alert, and comfortable. After anesthesia was started and the airway secured, she was laid on her back with her neck slightly extended and her head supported. The surgeon marked the C5‑C6 level and made a horizontal incision about 5 mm beyond the front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The area was cleaned with DuraPrep and covered with sterile drapes. A #10 scalpel blade was used to cut the skin and underlying tissue. Bleeding was controlled with bipolar cautery, and the platysma muscle was cut with a hot knife. The surgeon dissected under the platysma, staying between the esophagus and trachea on the left and the carotid sheath on the right. Fat around the prevertebral fascia was removed, and a branch of the superior thyroid artery was tied off with clips. A localizing X‑ray confirmed the correct level. The longus colli muscles were stripped from the C5 and C6 vertebrae. A self‑retaining retractor was placed. The surgeon drilled away the bony spur with a 5‑mm bur, then removed the disc and the lower part of the C5 endplate and the upper part of the C6 endplate with the same bur. A 3‑mm bur and a Kerrison rongeur removed the disc and posterior longitudinal ligament. The herniation was on the right, but the left side had more narrowing of the nerve passage. Both sides were decompressed. A Valsalva test showed no cerebrospinal fluid leak. The area was washed with saline and bacitracin solution.  \n\nA 7‑mm cage was placed, packed with Vitoss, and secured with four 14 × 4.0 mm screws and an 18‑mm titanium plate. X‑ray confirmed proper placement. A round 10‑French JP drain was inserted and brought out through a small stab incision on the right side. The drain was tied to the skin with a nylon stitch and connected to a sterile drainage system. The wound was closed in layers: Vicryl 3‑0 for the platysma, Vicryl 4‑0 subcuticular for the skin, and Dermabond for extra support. Only the drain exit site received a dressing. A cervical collar was applied. The patient was taken off the breathing tube and moved to recovery."
