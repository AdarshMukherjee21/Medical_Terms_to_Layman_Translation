  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion, and potentially unstable cervical spine. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Application of PMT large halo crown and vest. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. ANESTHESIA: Local, conscious sedation with Morphine and Versed. COMPLICATIONS: None. Post-fixation x-rays, nonalignment, no new changes. Post-fixation neurologic examination normal. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy. She was referred to me by Dr. X. The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate. Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days. She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities. No airway issues. It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller. She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest. The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1. I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure. I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine. A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic. Excellent fixation achieved. It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae. I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck. The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected. Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline. All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened. During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain. Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout. X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes. The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on. The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days. Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery. She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course. The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:**  \nThe patient had cervical spondylosis (spine degeneration in the neck) and had already had a complex surgery that removed parts of the neck bones, relieved pressure on the spinal cord, and fused the spine.\n\n**Post‑operative diagnosis:**  \nThe same conditions, plus the possibility that the neck spine might be unstable after surgery.\n\n**Procedure performed:**  \nA large halo crown and vest (PMT type) were attached to the patient’s skull to keep the neck still.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:**  \nNone.\n\n**Anesthesia used:**  \nLocal anesthesia with conscious sedation using Morphine and Versed.\n\n**Complications:**  \nNone. X‑rays after the halo was put on showed no misalignment or new problems. A neurological exam after the halo was normal.\n\n**Clinical history:**  \nA 41‑year‑old woman came to the doctor with severe neck degeneration and spinal cord compression. She was referred by Dr. X. She had a complicated surgery that removed two levels of the neck bone, relieved pressure on the spinal cord, and fused the spine with a fibular strut and a machine allograft in a large cervical plate. The surgery went well and she has been doing well for the last two days. She can move all four limbs and her nerves are improving. There were no breathing problems. Because the chance of needing another operation was low, the doctor decided she was a good candidate for a halo vest. She gave consent and the doctor chose a PMT halo instead of a Bremer halo. The halo was applied at the bedside in the intensive care unit (room #1). The doctor used 1 mg of Morphine, 2 mg of Versed, and local anesthetic (1 % Xylocaine with epinephrine) totaling 15–20 cc.\n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient’s head was positioned on towels. The area behind the ears was shaved and the forehead and sides of the head were cleaned with Betadine. A large PMT crown was fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthesia. The pins were placed just below the eyebrows and behind the ears, avoiding the supraorbital nerves. The vest was then put on by sitting the patient up and stabilizing the neck. The vest was brought in from the front and connected. The head was tilted slightly forward, extended a little, and kept in the middle line. All connections were secured and the pins tightened. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no significant pain. Afterward she remained neurologically intact. X‑rays (AP, lateral, and swimmer views) showed the hardware was in good alignment with no new changes. A CT scan will be done later to confirm alignment. If everything is fine, she will walk with the halo on. Pin‑site care will follow the usual protocol, and she is expected to leave the hospital in the next 2–3 days. Her outlook is excellent; she is about 90 % better after surgery. She is on a short course of Decadron, which will be tapered off. The plan was discussed with the patient and her family."
