  "medical": "This is a middle-aged female with moderate pain, severe swelling and a growth on the arm which is reportedly enlarging with limited range of motion for three months. FINDINGS: There is diffuse subcutis space edema extending along the posteromedial aspect of the elbow adjacent to the medial epicondyle, extending to the olecranon process and along the superficial aspect of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. There is no demonstrated solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion. There is enlargement with hyperintense signal of the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel. There is inflammation with mild laxity of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. The combined findings are most consistent with a ulnar nerve neuritis possibly secondary to a subluxing ulnar nerve however the ulnar nerve at this time is within the cubital tunnel. There is no accessory muscle within the cubital tunnel. The common flexor tendon origin is normal. Normal ulnar collateral ligamentous complex. There is mild epimysial sheath edema of the pronator teres muscle consistent with a mild epimysial sheath sprain but no muscular tear. There is minimal intratendinous inflammation of the common extensor tendon origin consistent with a mild tendinitis. There is no demonstrated common extensor tendon tear. Normal radial collateral ligamentous complex. Normal radiocapitellum and ulnotrochlear articulations. Normal triceps and biceps tendon insertions. There is peritendinous inflammation of the brachialis tendon insertion but an intrinsically normal tendon. IMPRESSION: Edema of the subcutis adipose space overlying the posteromedial aspect of the elbow with interstitial inflammation of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. Enlarged edematous ulnar nerve most compatible with ulnar nerve neuritis. The above combined findings suggest a subluxing ulnar nerve. Mild epimysial sheath strain of the pronator teres muscle but no muscular tear. Mild lateral epicondylitis with focal tendinitis of the origin of the common extensor tendon. Peritendinous edema of the brachialis tendon insertion. No solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion.",
  "layman": "This is a middle‑aged woman who has had moderate pain, severe swelling, and a growing lump on her arm for three months. The lump is getting bigger and limits how far she can move her elbow.\n\n**Findings**\n\n- The tissue just under the skin around the back‑middle part of her elbow is swollen and has fluid. The swelling extends from the inside of the elbow near the medial epicondyle (the bony bump on the inside of the elbow) all the way to the olecranon (the bony tip of the elbow) and along the outer part of the epicondylo‑olecranon ligament.\n- No solid lump, cyst, or fatty mass was seen.\n- The ulnar nerve (a major nerve that runs down the arm) is enlarged and shows a bright signal on the scan, indicating swelling. It is still inside the cubital tunnel (the space the nerve normally travels through).\n- The epicondylo‑olecranon ligament shows mild inflammation and a little looseness.\n- The overall picture fits with ulnar nerve neuritis, possibly because the nerve is slipping out of its normal spot (subluxation). At this time the nerve is still inside the tunnel.\n- No extra muscle is found in the cubital tunnel.\n- The common flexor tendon origin (where several tendons that bend the elbow attach) looks normal.\n- The ulnar collateral ligament (the ligament on the inside of the elbow) is normal.\n- The pronator teres muscle (a muscle that helps rotate the forearm) has mild swelling of its outer sheath, suggesting a mild strain, but the muscle itself is intact.\n- The common extensor tendon origin (where tendons that straighten the elbow attach) shows a little inflammation, indicating mild tendinitis. No tear is seen.\n- The radial collateral ligament (the ligament on the outside of the elbow) is normal.\n- The joint surfaces of the radius and ulna (the two forearm bones) are normal.\n- The triceps and biceps tendon attachments are normal.\n- The brachialis tendon (a muscle that helps bend the elbow) shows some swelling around its attachment, but the tendon itself is normal.\n\n**Impression**\n\n- Swelling of the tissue under the skin over the back‑middle part of the elbow and inflammation of the epicondylo‑olecranon ligament.\n- An enlarged, swollen ulnar nerve that fits with ulnar nerve neuritis, likely due to the nerve slipping out of place.\n- Mild strain of the outer sheath of the pronator teres muscle, but no muscle tear.\n- Mild inflammation of the common extensor tendon origin (lateral epicondylitis).\n- Swelling around the brachialis tendon attachment.\n- No solid lump, cyst, or fatty mass was found."
