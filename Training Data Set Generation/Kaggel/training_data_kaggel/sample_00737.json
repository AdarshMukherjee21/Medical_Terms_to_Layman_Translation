  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Alternating hard and soft stools. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Sigmoid diverticulosis. Sessile polyp of the sigmoid colon. Pedunculated polyp of the sigmoid colon. PROCEDURE: Total colonoscopy with biopsy and snare polypectomy. PREP: 4/4. DIFFICULTY: 1/4. PREMEDICATION AND SEDATION: Fentanyl 100, midazolam 5. INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: A 64-year-old male who has developed alternating hard and soft stools. He has one bowel movement a day. FINDINGS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of inflammation or bleeding. There was a small, sessile polyp in the sigmoid colon, and a larger pedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon, both appeared adenomatous. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Preoperative counseling, including an explicit discussion of the risk and treatment of perforation was provided. Preoperative physical examination was performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Premedications were given slowly by intravenous push. Rectal examination was performed, which was normal. The scope was introduced and passed with minimal difficulty to the cecum. This was verified anatomically and video photographs were taken of the ileocecal valve and appendiceal orifice. The scope was slowly withdrawn, the mucosa carefully visualized. It was normal in its entirety until reaching the sigmoid colon. Sigmoid colon had extensive diverticular disease, small-mouth, without inflammation or bleeding. In addition, there was a small sessile polyp, which was cold biopsied and recovered, and approximately an 8 mm pedunculated polyp. A snare was placed on the stalk of the polyp and divided with electrocautery. The polyp was recovered and sent for pathologic examination. Examination of the stalk showed good hemostasis. The scope was slowly withdrawn and the remainder of the examination was normal. ASSESSMENT: Diverticular disease. A diverticular disease handout was given to the patient's wife and a high fiber diet was recommended. In addition, 2 polyps, one of which is assuredly an adenoma. Patient needs a repeat colonoscopy in 3 years.",
  "layman": "**Pre‑operative diagnosis:** Stools that are sometimes hard and sometimes soft.  \n**Post‑operative diagnosis:** Diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon (the lower part of the large intestine). Two polyps were found in the sigmoid colon: one flat (sessile) and one on a stalk (pedunculated).  \n\n**Procedure:** A full colonoscopy with biopsy and removal of the polyps using a snare.  \n**Preparation:** 4/4 (complete).  \n**Difficulty:** 1/4 (very easy).  \n**Pre‑medication and sedation:** Fentanyl 100 mcg and midazolam 5 mg.  \n\n**Reason for the procedure:** A 64‑year‑old man who has alternating hard and soft stools and has one bowel movement per day.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- Extensive diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon, but no inflammation or bleeding.  \n- A small flat polyp and a larger polyp on a stalk, both looking like adenomas (pre‑cancerous).  \n\n**Procedure description:**  \nThe patient was told about the risks, especially perforation, and gave consent. He was positioned on his left side. Medications were given slowly through a vein. A normal rectal exam was done. The colonoscope was inserted and reached the cecum with little difficulty; pictures were taken. While withdrawing, the entire colon looked normal until the sigmoid colon, where diverticulosis was seen. The flat polyp was removed with a cold biopsy forceps. The larger stalked polyp (about 8 mm) was snared and cut with a small electric current. The polyp was retrieved and sent for pathology. The stalk was checked and bleeding was controlled. The rest of the colon was normal.  \n\n**Assessment:** Diverticular disease. A handout about diverticulosis was given to the wife, and a high‑fiber diet was suggested. Two polyps were found, one confirmed as an adenoma. A repeat colonoscopy is recommended in 3 years."
