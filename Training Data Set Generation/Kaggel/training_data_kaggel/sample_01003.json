  "medical": "CC: Episodic confusion. HX: This 65 y/o RHM reportedly suffered a stroke on 1/17/92. He presented locally at that time with complaint of episodic confusion and memory loss lasting several minutes per episode. The &quot;stroke&quot; was reportedly verified on MRI scan dated 1/17/92. He was subsequently placed on ASA and DPH. He admitted that there had been short periods (1-2 days duration) since then, during which he had forgotten to take his DPH. However, even when he had been taking his DPH regularly, he continued to experience the spells mentioned above. He denied any associated tonic/clonic movement, incontinence, tongue-biting, HA, visual change, SOB, palpitation, weakness or numbness. The episodes of confusion and memory loss last 1-2 minutes in duration, and have been occurring 2-3 times per week. PMH: Bilateral Hearing Loss of unknown etiology, S/P bilateral ear surgery many years ago. MEDS: DPH and ASA SHX/FHX: 2-4 Beers/day. 1-2 packs of cigarettes per day. EXAM: BP 111/68, P 68BPM, 36.8C. Alert and Oriented to person, place and time, 30/30 on mini-mental status test, Speech fluent and without dysarthria. CN: Left superior quandranopia only. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout. Sensory: unremarkable except for mild decreased vibration sense in feet. Coordination: unremarkable. Gait and station testing were unremarkable. He was able to tandem walk without difficulty. Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric throughout. Flexor plantar responses bilaterally. LAB: Gen Screen, CBC, PT, PTT all WNL. DPH 4.6mcg/ml. Review of outside MRI Brain done 1/17/92 revealed decreased T1 and increased T2 signal in the Right temporal lobe involving the uncus and adjacent hippocampus. The area did not enhance with gadolinium contrast. CXR: 8/31/92: 5 x 6 mm spiculated opacity in apex right lung. EEG: 8/24/92: normal awake and asleep MRI Brain with/without contrast: 8/31/92: Decreased T1 and increased T2 signal in the right temporal lobe. The lesion increased in size and enhances more greatly when compared to the 1/17/92 MRI exam. There is also edema surrounding the affected area and associated mass effect. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING: Low-average digit symbol substitution, mildly impaired verbal learning, and severely defective delayed recall. There was relative preservation of other cognitive functions. The findings were consistent with left mesiotemporal dysfunction. COURSE: Patient underwent right temporal lobectomy on 9/16/92 following initial treatment with Decadron. Pathologic analysis was consistent with a Grade 2 astrocytoma. GFAP staining positive. Following surgery he underwent 5040 cGy radiation therapy in 28 fractions to the tumor bed.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:**  \nThe patient, a 65‑year‑old man, has been having brief episodes of confusion and memory loss.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nHe had a stroke on January 17, 1992. At that time he was taken to a local hospital where he complained of short periods of confusion and memory loss that lasted a few minutes each time. An MRI on that day confirmed the stroke. He was started on aspirin (ASA) and dipyridamole (DPH). He has sometimes missed doses of DPH for 1–2 days, but even when he takes it regularly he still has the confusion spells. He denies any seizures, loss of bladder control, tongue biting, headaches, vision changes, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, weakness, or numbness. The confusion episodes last 1–2 minutes and occur 2–3 times a week.\n\n**Past medical history:**  \n- Bilateral hearing loss of unknown cause, treated with ear surgery many years ago.  \n- Smokes 1–2 packs of cigarettes a day.  \n- Takes aspirin and dipyridamole.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 111/68 mm Hg, pulse 68 bpm, temperature 36.8 °C.  \n- Alert, oriented to person, place, and time.  \n- Mini‑mental status score 30/30.  \n- Speech fluent, no slurring.  \n- Left superior quadrantanopia (loss of a quarter of the visual field).  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 everywhere.  \n- Sensation normal except slightly reduced vibration sense in the feet.  \n- Coordination normal.  \n- Walks normally, can walk heel‑to‑toe without difficulty.  \n- Reflexes 2+ and symmetrical.  \n- Plantar reflexes normal.\n\n**Laboratory tests:**  \n- Complete blood count, PT, PTT all within normal limits.  \n- DPH level 4.6 µg/mL.\n\n**Imaging and other studies:**  \n- MRI (Jan 17, 1992): low T1, high T2 signal in the right temporal lobe (uncus and nearby hippocampus) with no contrast enhancement.  \n- Chest X‑ray (Aug 31, 1992): 5 × 6 mm spiculated spot in the right lung apex.  \n- EEG (Aug 24, 1992): normal while awake and asleep.  \n- MRI (Aug 31, 1992): the right temporal lesion had grown, enhanced more with contrast, had surrounding swelling (edema) and pressed on nearby brain tissue (mass effect).  \n- Neuropsychological testing: average speed on digit‑symbol test, mild trouble learning new words, very poor delayed recall; other cognitive functions were relatively preserved. Findings suggested left mesiotemporal dysfunction.\n\n**Course of treatment:**  \n- Underwent right temporal lobectomy on Sep 16, 1992 after a course of Decadron (a steroid).  \n- Pathology showed a Grade 2 astrocytoma (a type of brain tumor) with positive GFAP staining.  \n- Received 5,040 cGy of radiation therapy in 28 fractions to the tumor bed."
