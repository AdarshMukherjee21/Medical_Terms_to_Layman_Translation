  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula). OPERATION PERFORMED: Surgical closure of gastrostomy. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This 1-year-old child had a gastrostomy placed due to feeding difficulties. Since then, he has reached a point where he is now eating completely by mouth and no longer needed the gastrostomy. The tube was, therefore, removed, but the tract has not shown signs of spontaneous closure. He, therefore, comes to the operating room today for surgical closure of his gastrostomy. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner. An elliptical incision was made around the gastrostomy site and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection. The tract and the stomach were freed. Stay sutures were then placed on either side of the tract. The tract was amputated. The intervening stomach was then closed with interrupted #4-0 Lembert, Nurolon sutures. The fascia was then closed over the stomach using #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl. A dressing was applied, and the child was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",

He has now learned to eat entirely by mouth, so the tube was removed. The hole left by the tube has not closed on its own, so the child is having surgery to close it.\n\n**Operative procedure:**  \nAfter the child was put under general anesthesia, the belly was cleaned and covered in the usual way. An oval cut was made around the old tube site, cutting through the skin and the fat beneath it. The tube tract and the stomach were freed. Stitches were placed on either side of the tract to hold the area. The tract was cut out. The remaining part of the stomach was stitched closed with interrupted #4‑0 Lembert, Nurolon stitches. The muscle layer (fascia) was stitched over the stomach with #3‑0 Vicryl stitches. The skin was stitched closed with #5‑0 subcuticular Monocryl stitches. A dressing was applied, and the child was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition."
