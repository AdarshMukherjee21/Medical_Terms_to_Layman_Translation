  "medical": "EXAM:MRI CERVICAL SPINE CLINICAL: A57-year-old male. Received for outside consultation is an MRI examination performed on 11/28/2005. FINDINGS: Normal brainstem-cervical cord junction. Normal cisterna magna with no tonsillar ectopia. Normal clivus with a normal craniovertebral junction. Normal anterior atlantoaxial articulation. C2-3: Normal intervertebral disc with no spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina with no cord or radicular impingement. C3-4: There is disc desiccation with minimal annular bulging. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 10mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. C4-5: There is disc desiccation with endplate spondylosis and mild uncovertebral joint arthrosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 8mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft producing a borderline central canal stenosis but no cord distortion or cord edema. There is minimal uncovertebral joint arthrosis. C5-6: There is disc desiccation with minimal posterior annular bulging and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion measuring approximately 2 x 8mm (AP x transverse). The disc protrusion produces minimal rightward ventral thecal sac flattening but no cord impingement. C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild loss of disc space height and posterior endplate spondylosis and annular bulging producing central canal stenosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 8 mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. There is a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex encroaching upon the left intervertebral neural foramen with probable radicular impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root. C7-T1, T1-2: Minimal disc desiccation with no disc displacement or endplate spondylosis. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc disease as described above. C4-5 borderline central canal stenosis with mild bilateral foraminal compromise. C5-6 disc desiccation with a borderline central canal stenosis and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion producing thecal sac distortion. C6-7 degenerative disc disease and endplate spondylosis with a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex producing probable neural impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root with a borderline central canal stenosis. Normal cervical cord.",
  "layman": "**MRI of the cervical spine**\n\n**Patient:** 57‑year‑old man.  \n**Date of exam:** 11/28/2005.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The brainstem and the start of the spinal cord look normal.  \n- The space behind the brain (cisterna magna) is normal and the tonsils are in the right place.  \n- The skull base (clivus) and the junction where the skull meets the spine are normal.  \n- The joint between the first two cervical vertebrae (C1‑C2) is normal.  \n\n**Cervical vertebrae:**\n\n- **C2‑C3:** The disc is normal, with no bone changes or joint wear. The spinal canal and the openings for nerves are clear, with no pressure on the cord or nerves.  \n- **C3‑C4:** The disc is slightly dry and has a small bulge. The spinal canal is about 10 mm wide, and fluid still surrounds the cord.  \n- **C4‑C5:** The disc is dry, the bone edges show mild wear, and there is a small joint wear. The canal is about 8 mm wide, and the fluid space is almost closed, giving a borderline narrowing of the canal but no damage to the cord.  \n- **C5‑C6:** The disc is dry with a small bulge at the back and a small disc protrusion on the right side (about 2 mm front‑to‑back by 8 mm wide). This pushes the front of the fluid space slightly to the right but does not press on the cord.  \n- **C6‑C7:** The disc is dry, the space between the vertebrae is a little lower, and the bone edges show wear and a bulge. The canal is 8 mm wide and the fluid space is almost closed. A bone‑disc growth on the left side presses into the left nerve opening, likely irritating the left C7 nerve root.  \n- **C7‑T1 and T1‑T2:** The discs are slightly dry but show no displacement or bone wear.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n- Degenerative disc disease at several levels.  \n- Mild narrowing of the spinal canal at C4‑C5 and C6‑C7, with some narrowing of the nerve openings.  \n- A small disc bulge at C5‑C6 that slightly changes the shape of the fluid space.  \n- A bone‑disc growth at C6‑C7 that probably irritates the left C7 nerve root.  \n- The cervical spinal cord itself looks normal."
