  "medical": "EXAM:MRI LEFT KNEE CLINICAL:This is a 41 -year-old-male with knee pain, mobility loss and swelling. The patient had a twisting injury one week ago on 8/5/05. The examination was performed on 8/10/05 FINDINGS: There is intrasubstance degeneration within the medial meniscus without a discrete surfacing tear. There is intrasubstance degeneration within the lateral meniscus, and there is a probable small tear in the anterior horn along the undersurface at the meniscal root. There is an interstitial sprain/partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. There is no complete tear or discontinuity, and the ligament has a celery stick appearance. Normal posterior cruciate ligament. Normal medial collateral ligament. There is a sprain of the femoral attachment of the fibular collateral ligament, without complete tear or discontinuity. The fibular attachment is intact. Normal biceps femoris tendon, popliteus tendon and iliotibial band. Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons. There are no fractures. There is arthrosis, with high-grade changes in the patellofemoral compartment, particularly along the midline patellar ridge and lateral facet. There are milder changes within the medial femorotibial compartments. There are subcortical cystic changes subjacent to the tibial spine, which appear chronic. There is a joint effusion. There is synovial thickening. IMPRESSION: Probable small tear in the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus at the meniscal root. Interstitial sprain/partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. Arthrosis, joint effusion and synovial hypertrophy. There are several areas of focal prominent medullary fat within the medial and lateral femoral condyles.",
  "layman": "EXAM: MRI of the left knee  \nCLINICAL: A 41‑year‑old man has knee pain, trouble moving it, and swelling. He twisted his knee a week ago on 8/5/05. The MRI was done on 8/10/05.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n- The middle part of the inner (medial) meniscus is worn out, but there is no clear tear on the surface.  \n- The middle part of the outer (lateral) meniscus is also worn out, and there is a likely small tear at the front part of the meniscus near its root.  \n- The front (anterior) cruciate ligament (ACL) is stretched and has a partial tear inside it. It is not completely torn; it looks like a “celery stick.”  \n- The back cruciate ligament (PCL) is normal.  \n- The inner knee ligament (MCL) is normal.  \n- The outer knee ligament (LCL) is stretched at the point where it attaches to the femur, but it is not completely torn. The attachment point itself is intact.  \n- The biceps femoris tendon, popliteus tendon, and iliotibial band are normal.  \n- The quadriceps and patellar tendons are normal.  \n- No fractures are seen.  \n- There is arthritis (arthrosis). The changes are severe in the joint between the kneecap and the thigh bone (patellofemoral compartment), especially along the middle ridge of the kneecap and the outer side. The changes in the inner part of the knee (medial femorotibial compartment) are milder.  \n- There are small cyst‑like changes under the bone near the tibial spine that look old (chronic).  \n- The joint has fluid buildup (effusion).  \n- The lining of the joint (synovium) is thickened.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n- Small tear in the front part of the outer meniscus near its root.  \n- Partial tear inside the ACL.  \n- Arthritis, joint fluid buildup, and thickened joint lining.  \n- Several spots of prominent fat inside the inner and outer thigh bone (medial and lateral femoral condyles)."
