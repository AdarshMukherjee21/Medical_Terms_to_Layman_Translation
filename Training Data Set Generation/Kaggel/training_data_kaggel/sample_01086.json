  "medical": "TITLE OF OPERATION: Youngswick osteotomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hallux limitus deformity of the right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hallux limitus deformity of the right foot. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with 15 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. HEMOSTASIS: Right ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg for 35 minutes. MATERIALS USED: 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and two partially threaded cannulated screws from 3.0 OsteoMed System for internal fixation. INJECTABLES: Ancef 1 g IV 30 minutes preoperatively. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site. The right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmHg. The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated. The right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique. Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe. The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint. All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal. Once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered. Gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient. Using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions. Using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe. Although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present. The decision was thus made to perform a Youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal. The osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a V-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal. The two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation. The wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to Pathology for further examination. The head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the OsteoMed System. The wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy. The wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the OsteoMed System. The 2 screws were inserted using AO technique. Upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed. Fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent. The area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction. The cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation. The capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues. Steri-Strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges. At this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated. Immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. The patient's surgical site was then covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage. The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home. The patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain. The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.",
  "layman": "**Operation Title:** Youngswick osteotomy with screw fixation of the first right toe joint.  \n\n**Pre‑ and Post‑operative Diagnosis:** Limited motion of the big toe joint on the right foot (hallux limitus).  \n\n**Anesthesia:** Sedation with a mix of 0.5 % Marcaine and 1 % lidocaine (15 mL total).  \n\n**Estimated Blood Loss:** < 10 mL.  \n\n**Tourniquet:** 18‑inch cuff on the right ankle, set to 250 mmHg for 35 minutes.  \n\n**Materials Used:**  \n- 3‑0 and 4‑0 Vicryl sutures  \n- Two partially threaded cannulated screws (3.0 mm) from the OsteoMed System  \n\n**Injectables:** 1 g of Ancef IV given 30 minutes before surgery.  \n\n**Procedure Summary:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, laid on her back, and sedated. The anesthetic mix was injected into the right foot to numb the area. The right ankle was padded and a tourniquet was applied and inflated. The foot was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n\nA 6‑cm incision was made on the top of the right big‑toe joint, just below the tendon that lifts the toe. The incision was deepened through skin and tissue, stopping any bleeding. The joint capsule and bone covering the joint were exposed. Tendons and nerves were carefully moved aside to keep them safe.  \n\nThe surgeon removed bone spurs (osteophytes) from the top, middle, and side of the first metatarsal head and the base of the big‑toe bone. Some gouty deposits (tophi) were also removed. After removing the spurs, the toe still had some tightness, so a Youngswick osteotomy was performed.  \n\nThe osteotomy involved two cuts on the top of the bone and one cut on the bottom, forming a V shape. The wedge of bone between the top cuts was removed and sent to pathology. The remaining bone was repositioned and temporarily held with two wires. These wires guided the placement of two 16‑mm screws that fixed the bone in place. The wires were removed after the screws were in.  \n\nThe joint surfaces were lightly scored to encourage new cartilage growth. The capsule and outer bone layer were stitched together with 3‑0 Vicryl, the skin layers with 4‑0 Vicryl, and the skin edges were reinforced with Steri‑Strips.  \n\nThe tourniquet was released, causing a brief redness in the leg. The wound was cleaned with saline, and the toe’s range of motion was checked and found to be much better than before surgery. The foot was covered with Xeroform, gauze, and a bandage. A surgical shoe was placed on the foot.  \n\nThe patient was moved to recovery with stable vital signs and normal foot function. She received instructions on foot care and pain medication. She was discharged from the hospital and scheduled to see Dr. X in one week for a follow‑up appointment."
