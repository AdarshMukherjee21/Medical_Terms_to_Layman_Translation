  "medical": "CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Motor vehicle collision. CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained. FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection. The ventricles and cortical sulci are normal in shape and configuration. The gray/white matter junctions are well preserved. There is no calvarial fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: Negative for acute intracranial disease. CT CERVICAL SPINE TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained. Sagittal and coronal images were obtained. FINDINGS: Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis is compatible with patient position versus muscle spasms. No fracture or subluxation is seen. Anterior and posterior osteophyte formation is seen at C5-C6. No abnormal anterior cervical soft tissue swelling is seen. No spinal compression is noted. The atlanto-dens interval is normal. There is a large retention cyst versus polyp within the right maxillary sinus. IMPRESSION: 1. Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis compatible with patient positioning versus muscle spasms. 2. Degenerative disk and joint disease at C5-C6. 3. Retention cyst versus polyp of the right maxillary sinus.",
  "layman": "CT scan of the head (no contrast) and CT scan of the cervical spine (no contrast)\n\n**Reason for the exam:** You were in a car accident.\n\n**Head CT – How it was done:** Images were taken without contrast.\n\n**Findings – Head:**  \n- No bleeding, swelling, or shift of the brain.  \n- The brain’s shape and the spaces around it look normal.  \n- The gray and white parts of the brain are clear.  \n- No skull fracture.  \n- The sinuses and ear air cells that were seen are clear.\n\n**Impression – Head:**  \n- No new brain problems.\n\n**Cervical spine CT – How it was done:** Images were taken without contrast, plus side‑view and front‑view images.\n\n**Findings – Spine:**  \n- The normal curve of the neck is a bit straightened, probably because of how you were positioned or muscle tension.  \n- No broken bones or dislocations.  \n- There are bone spurs on the front and back of the C5‑C6 vertebrae.  \n- No swelling of the soft tissues in front of the spine.  \n- No pressure on the spinal cord.  \n- The space between the top of the skull and the first cervical vertebra is normal.  \n- A large cyst or polyp is present in the right maxillary sinus.\n\n**Impression – Spine:**  \n1. Straightened neck curve likely due to positioning or muscle tension.  \n2. Degenerative changes (bone spurs) at C5‑C6.  \n3. Cyst or polyp in the right maxillary sinus."
