  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes, bilateral intraabdominal testes. PROCEDURE: Examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 110 mL of crystalloid. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Atrophic bilateral testes, right is larger than left. The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis. TUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes. Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable. Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected. We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage. We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors. Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens. Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg. We then evaluated. There was no bleeding noted. He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized. The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring. So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side. Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas. We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised. The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors. We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring. We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery. We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch. Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation. Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction. Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic. We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short. The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent. We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present. We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions. At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed. The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS  \nBoth testes have not moved into the scrotum.  \n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS  \nBoth testes are still inside the abdomen.  \n\nPROCEDURE  \nThe boy was put under anesthesia, examined, and the right testis was moved into the scrotum using a laparoscopic (small‑incision) technique.  \n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  \nLess than 5 mL.  \n\nFLUIDS GIVEN  \n110 mL of crystalloid solution.  \n\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS  \nBoth testes were smaller than normal; the right one was larger than the left. The left testis had a very small or abnormal blood vessel and epididymis.  \n\nTUBES AND DRAINS  \nNone were placed.  \n\nINDICATIONS FOR OPERATION  \nA 7‑month‑old boy had two testes that could not be felt under the skin. The plan was to look inside the abdomen and, if possible, move a testis into the scrotum.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION  \nThe boy was taken to the operating room. The surgeon checked the patient’s identity, the surgical site, and obtained consent. After the boy was anesthetized, the surgeon tried to feel the testes again and could not find them. Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was chosen.  \n\nThe area was cleaned and covered. A small feeding tube was inserted into the urethra for drainage. An incision was made below the belly button with a 15‑blade knife and extended with cautery and clamps to the rectus muscle. Stay sutures were placed on the front and back of the muscle, and the muscle was cut with scissors.  \n\nThe belly cavity was entered and a 5‑mm port was placed with a 0‑degree lens. Carbon dioxide was pumped in to create space, raising pressure to 10‑12 mmHg. The surgeon looked inside. No bleeding was seen.  \n\nThe left side had a closed ring and a small testis with short vessels and an almost absent vas. The right side also had a testis inside the abdomen, but it was larger, had better vessels, a clearer vas, and was closer to the internal ring. The surgeon decided to move the right testis into the scrotum.  \n\nUsing laparoscopic scissors, the surgeon opened the internal ring and dissected the tissue along the vas and vessels toward the kidney and bladder. A Maryland dissector was used to gently separate the tissue. The gubernaculum was cut with cautery and scissors. The surgeon continued to dissect the peritoneum, vessels, and vas until the testis could be pulled across the abdomen to the left side of the ring.  \n\nA curved incision was made on the upper right scrotum with a 15‑blade knife and extended down with cautery. Curved scissors made a pocket under the dartos layer. A mosquito clamp was used to grasp the testis from the internal ring opening and pull it into the scrotum in the correct orientation. The surgeon further dissected the internal ring tissue to relieve tension on the vessels and vas.  \n\nTwo stay sutures of 4‑0 chromic were used to secure the testis to the base of the scrotum. The upper part of the dartos pocket was closed with 4‑0 chromic, and the pocket and skin were closed with subcutaneous 4‑0 chromic.  \n\nThe left side was examined again; the vessels were very short, the testis was more atrophic, and the vas was almost absent. The surgeon decided to postpone moving the left testis because it would be difficult and could cause more atrophy.  \n\nThe ports were removed. The muscle layer was closed with a figure‑of‑eight 3‑0 Monocryl suture. The belly‑button incision was closed with two Monocryl stay sutures, and the skin was closed with 4‑0 Rapide. Dermabond adhesive was applied to all incisions.  \n\nAt the end, the right testis was in the scrotum, the feeding tube was removed, and the boy received IV Toradol. He was stable when transferred to recovery."
