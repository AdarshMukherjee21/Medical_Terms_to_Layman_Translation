  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is a 46-year-old right-handed gentleman with a past medical history of a left L5-S1 lumbar microdiskectomy in 1998 with complete resolution of left leg symptoms, who now presents with a four-month history of gradual onset of right-sided low back pain with pain radiating down into his buttock and posterior aspect of his right leg into the ankle. Symptoms are worsened by any activity and relieved by rest. He also feels that when the pain is very severe, he has some subtle right leg weakness. No left leg symptoms. No bowel or bladder changes. On brief examination, full strength in both lower extremities. No sensory abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the patellas and absent at both ankles. Positive straight leg raising on the right. MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals a right paracentral disc at L5-S1 encroaching upon the right exiting S1 nerve root. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, and conduction velocities are normal in the lower extremities. The right common peroneal F-wave is minimally prolonged. The right tibial H reflex is absent. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg, left gastrocnemius medialis muscle, and right lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in the right gastrocnemius medialis, gluteus maximus, and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There was evidence of chronic denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis and gluteus maximus muscles. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals an acute right S1 radiculopathy. There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy or left or right L5 radiculopathy. Results were discussed with the patient and he is scheduled to follow up with Dr. X in the near future.",
  "layman": "HISTORY: A 46‑year‑old right‑handed man had a left L5‑S1 microdiskectomy in 1998, which stopped his left leg pain. He now has had gradual right‑side low back pain for four months. The pain goes down into his buttock, back of the right leg, and ankle. It gets worse with any activity and eases when he rests. When the pain is very bad, he notices a slight weakness in his right leg. He has no left leg pain and no bowel or bladder problems. On a quick exam he has full strength in both legs, no sensory loss, knee reflexes are normal (2+), ankle reflexes are absent, and a straight‑leg‑raise test is positive on the right. An MRI shows a disc on the right side at L5‑S1 that is pressing on the right S1 nerve root.\n\nNERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory timing, response size, and speed are normal in both legs. The right common peroneal F‑wave is only a little slower than normal, and the right tibial H‑reflex is missing.\n\nNEEDLE EMG: A needle test was done on the right leg, the left calf muscle (gastrocnemius medialis), and the right lower back muscles. It found abnormal spontaneous muscle activity in the right calf, right gluteus maximus, and lower back muscles. There is evidence of long‑term nerve loss in the right calf and gluteus maximus.\n\nIMPRESSION: The electrical tests are abnormal and show an acute S1 nerve root problem on the right. There is no sign of a peripheral nerve disease or an L5 nerve root issue on either side. The results were explained to the patient, and he will see Dr. X again soon."
