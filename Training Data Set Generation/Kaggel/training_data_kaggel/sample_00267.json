  "medical": "HISTORY: The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety. The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills. She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals. The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time. The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation. STUDY: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair. To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1). The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation. ORAL STAGE: The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport. No spillage out lips. The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars. The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state. Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation. We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid. PHARYNGEAL STAGE: No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation. The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits. Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits. She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow. CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus. DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation. She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars. Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician. PLAN: Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended: 1. The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids. She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux. 2. The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars. The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately. Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care. She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services.",
  "layman": "**History:**  \nA 71‑year‑old woman was sent for an outpatient barium swallow test to check how she swallows and to see if it is safe. She said she feels a lump high in her throat, especially when eating solid foods or taking pills. She does not cough or choke while eating. I do not know her full medical history. She was cooperative during the test.\n\n**Study:**  \nThe barium swallow was done in the Radiology Suite with Dr. X. She sat upright in a video chair. We gave her small amounts of food and liquid that had barium in them:  \n- Thin liquid (teaspoon ×3, cup sip ×4)  \n- Thick liquid (cup sip ×3)  \n- Puree (teaspoon ×3)  \n- Solid (¼ cracker ×1)  \nAfter the puree and solid, she had 2 more cup sips of thin liquid.\n\n**Oral Stage:**  \nShe could control and move the food in her mouth without spilling. However, she had a pocket of food that stayed between her right tonsil area (faucial pillars) when eating puree and solid food. She had her tonsil removed as a child, so this pocket looks like a diverticulum. We could not clear the leftover food with extra sips. An ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor should look at this area because of the residual food.\n\n**Pharyngeal Stage:**  \nNo food went into her airway (no aspiration or penetration). Her throat muscles moved normally, and the epiglottis worked properly. There was no leftover food in her throat after swallowing.\n\n**Cervical Esophageal Stage:**  \nHer upper esophageal opening worked well and let the food pass through.\n\n**Diagnostic Impression:**  \nShe did not aspirate or penetrate during the test. She appears to have a diverticulum between her right faucial pillars. An ENT evaluation is needed.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. She should eat regular‑consistency foods and thin liquids. Taking small bites and sips can help reduce the risk of choking, aspiration, or reflux.  \n2. She should be referred to an ENT doctor to examine the area between her faucial pillars.  \nThese recommendations and the test results were discussed with her and her daughter, who understood them. She does not need speech therapy and is discharged from my care."
