  "medical": "PROCEDURES PERFORMED: C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy, allograft fusion, and anterior plating. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 57-year-old gentleman with refractory neck pain with single-level degeneration of the cervical spine and there was also some arm pain. We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion. The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication. The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut. He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded. The tape was placed and his arms were well padded. He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region. We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space. We then marked the disc space. We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space. We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates. We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well. We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone. We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space. We then sized a 23-mm plate. We inserted the screws nicely above and below. We tightened down the lock-nuts. We irrigated the wound. We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate. We then assured hemostasis once again. We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion. The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this. We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs. I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.",
  "layman": "**Procedures Done:**  \n- Removed the disc between the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae (C5‑C6) from the front of the neck.  \n- Placed a bone graft from a donor (allograft) to fuse the two vertebrae.  \n- Added a metal plate and screws to hold the bones together.\n\n**Estimated Blood Loss:** 10 mL.\n\n**Clinical Note:**  \nA 57‑year‑old man had severe neck pain that did not improve with other treatments. He also had pain in one arm. The doctors explained that the surgery might not relieve all pain and could cause complications such as paralysis, hoarseness, nerve damage, or infection. He agreed to have the surgery.\n\n**Procedure Description:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia through a breathing tube. He was positioned with his neck slightly extended, and his head was secured with a doughnut‑shaped device. Tape was placed over his shoulders for X‑ray imaging, and his elbows were padded. The surgical area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.\n\nA straight cut was made near the larynx, from the middle of the neck to the side of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The outer layer of the neck (platysma) was separated from the tissue underneath and then cut along the muscle’s edge. The surgeon carefully moved tissues to the side of the carotid artery, which was felt near the spine. Retractors were used to expose the C5‑C6 disc space, confirmed with a lateral X‑ray that showed a small needle in the disc.\n\nThe disc space was marked, and the surgeon removed the front bone spurs and any bony bumps that made the space uneven. Under magnification, all disc material was taken out until the bone surfaces (endplates) were visible. The posterior longitudinal ligament was also removed. A 6‑mm bone piece was placed into the disc space. A 23‑mm metal plate was sized and positioned over the vertebrae. Screws were inserted above and below the plate, and lock‑nuts were tightened. The wound was washed, and bleeding was stopped with bone wax before the plate was secured. The surgeon checked again to ensure no bleeding.\n\nThe outer neck layer (platysma) was stitched closed with 3‑0 Vicryl in simple stitches. The deeper tissue was closed with buried 3‑0 Vicryl stitches. The skin was closed with a running 3‑0 Monocryl stitch, and Steri‑Strips were applied. A dry sterile dressing with Telfa was placed over the wound.\n\nAn X‑ray taken during surgery confirmed the correct level and proper placement of the plate and screws. The patient was moved to the recovery room with all four limbs moving normally and stable vital signs. The primary surgeon was present for the entire operation."
