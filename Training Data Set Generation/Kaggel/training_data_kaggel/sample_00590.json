Anterior spine fusion from T11-L3. 2. Posterior spine fusion from T3-L5. 3. Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 500 mL. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a severe scoliosis. This was found to be moderately corrected. Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy. INDICATIONS: The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis. He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression. Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits. They wished to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. General anesthesia was induced without incident. He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics. Appropriate lines were then placed. He had a neuromonitoring performed as well. He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up. An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib. Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision. The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed. The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later. The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally. This allowed for entry into the pleural space. The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap. The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine. Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies. This required cauterization of the segmental vessels. Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed. These were performed from T11-L3. This was over 5 levels. Disks and endplates were then removed. Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces. The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine. This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature. The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity. The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well. Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl. This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape. The patient was then rotated into a prone position. The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion. Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5. The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision. Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis. The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split. This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes. Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine. These were placed at L4 and L5. The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum. This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur. Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft. Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed. These were placed from L3-T3. Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned. This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side. The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine. This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature. Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin. This was done using pulsed lavage. The wound was then closed in layers. The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed. The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition. All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated.",

Fusion of the front part of the spine from T11 to L3.  \n2. Fusion of the back part of the spine from T3 to L5.  \n3. Placement of back‑side screws and rods from T3 to L5, with bone grafts taken from the patient’s own rib and from a donor.\n\n**Estimated blood loss:** about 500 mL.\n\n**Findings:** The surgeon confirmed a severe curvature of the spine that was partially corrected during surgery. All hardware (screws and rods) was in good position when checked with X‑ray imaging.\n\n**Indications:** The patient has a long‑standing severe neurogenic scoliosis. Surgery was planned to straighten the curve and stop it from getting worse. The risks and benefits were explained many times to the family, and they chose to proceed.\n\n---\n\n### Surgical steps\n\n**Front‑side (anterior) part of the operation**\n\n1. The patient was taken to the operating room, laid on his back, and given general anesthesia. Antibiotics were given based on his weight. Lines were placed and the nervous system was monitored.\n2. The surgeon turned the patient onto his left side. A curved cut was made in the flank over the 10th rib. The rib was removed and saved for later bone grafting.\n3. The lining of the lung (pleura) was split to enter the chest cavity. The lung was gently lifted. The diaphragm was split to reach the lower spine.\n4. The surgeon exposed the spine from T11 to L3, cutting away soft tissue and cauterizing small blood vessels. The discs between the vertebrae were removed (discectomy) at five levels.\n5. The rib bone that had been removed was chopped into small pieces and placed into the spaces where the discs had been removed.\n6. The table was bent to help straighten the spine, then straightened again to compress and correct the curve. The diaphragm and pleura were repaired. The ribs were stitched together with #1 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were closed with running #2‑0 PDS sutures, and the skin was closed with running #2‑0 PDS and #4‑0 Monocryl sutures. The wound was covered with sterile dressings and tape.\n\n**Back‑side (posterior) part of the operation**\n\n1. The patient was turned onto his stomach. The back was cleaned and draped. A long cut was made from T2 to L5. Soft tissue was cut away, and bleeding was controlled with electrocautery.\n2. The spinous processes (the bony bumps on the back of each vertebra) and surrounding joints were exposed. A C‑arm X‑ray machine was used to place screws at L4 and L5.\n3. The spaces between the spinous processes were cleared of soft tissue and ligament. The spinous processes were also cut into small pieces for bone graft.\n4. Wire rods (Songer wires) were passed from L3 up to T3. A rod was then placed and secured to the screws at the lower end. The wires were tightened from top to bottom, first on the left side, then on the right, which helped straighten the curve.\n5. The bone surfaces were roughened (decortication) and the small bone pieces from the rib and from a donor were placed into the spaces. The wound was irrigated with 4 L of saline mixed with bacitracin using a pulsed lavage device.\n6. The wound was closed in layers: deep fascia with running #1 PDS, subcutaneous tissue with running #2‑0 PDS, and skin with #4‑0 Monocryl. Steri‑Strips, Xeroform dressings, and tape were applied.\n\nThe patient was awakened from anesthesia and moved to the intensive care unit in stable condition. All surgical instruments, sponges, and needles were counted correctly. He will continue to be cared for in the ICU and then on the regular floor as needed."
