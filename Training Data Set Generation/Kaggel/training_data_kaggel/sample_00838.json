  "medical": "PROCEDURES: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsy and polypectomy. REASON FOR PROCEDURE: Child with abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. Rule out inflammatory bowel disease, allergic enterocolitis, rectal polyps, and rectal vascular malformations. CONSENT: History and physical examination was performed. The procedure, indications, alternatives available, and complications, i.e. bleeding, perforation, infection, adverse medication reaction, the possible need for blood transfusion, and surgery should a complication occur were discussed with the parents who understood and indicated this. Opportunity for questions was provided and informed consent was obtained. MEDICATION: General anesthesia. INSTRUMENT: Olympus GIF-160. COMPLICATIONS: None. FINDINGS: With the patient in the supine position and intubated, the endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx. The esophageal mucosa and vascular pattern appeared normal. The lower esophageal sphincter was located at 25 cm from the central incisors. It appeared normal. A Z-line was identified within the lower esophageal sphincter. The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which distended with excess air. Rugal folds flattened completely. Gastric mucosa appeared normal throughout. No hiatal hernia was noted. Pyloric valve appeared normal. The endoscope was advanced into the first, second, and third portions of duodenum, which had normal mucosa, coloration, and fold pattern. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of duodenum, antrum, and distal esophagus at 22 cm from the central incisors for histology. Additional 2 biopsies were obtained for CLO testing in the antrum. Excess air was evacuated from the stomach. The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of procedure well. The patient was turned and the scope was advanced with some difficulty to the terminal ileum. The terminal ileum mucosa and the colonic mucosa throughout was normal except at approximately 10 cm where a 1 x 1 cm pedunculated juvenile-appearing polyp was noted. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum. Then, the polyp was snared right at the base of the polyp on the stalk and 20 watts of pure coag was applied in 2-second bursts x3. The polyp was severed. There was no bleeding at the stalk after removal of the polyp head. The polyp head was removed by suction. Excess air was evacuated from the colon. The patient tolerated that part of the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition. Estimated blood loss approximately 5 mL. IMPRESSION: Normal esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon as well as terminal ileum except for a 1 x 1-cm rectal polyp, which was removed successfully by polypectomy snare. PLAN: Histologic evaluation and CLO testing. I will contact the parents next week with biopsy results and further management plans will be discussed at that time.",
  "layman": "**Procedures:**  \n- An upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) and a colonoscopy were done.  \n- Biopsies were taken and a small growth (polyp) was removed.\n\n**Reason for the procedures:**  \nThe child had belly pain and bleeding from the rectum. The doctors wanted to check for inflammatory bowel disease, allergic inflammation of the intestines, rectal polyps, or abnormal blood vessels in the rectum.\n\n**Consent:**  \nThe child’s history and physical exam were reviewed. The doctors explained the purpose of the tests, other options, and possible risks such as bleeding, a hole in the intestine, infection, a bad reaction to medicine, the need for a blood transfusion, or surgery if something went wrong. The parents asked questions, understood the information, and gave permission.  \n\n**Medication:**  \nThe child was given general anesthesia.\n\n**Equipment:**  \nAn Olympus GIF‑160 endoscope was used.\n\n**Complications:**  \nNone.\n\n**Findings:**  \nThe child lay on their back and the scope was passed easily into the throat.  \n- The esophagus looked normal.  \n- The lower esophageal sphincter (the muscle that closes the esophagus) was at 25 cm from the front teeth and looked normal.  \n- A normal “Z‑line” was seen.  \n- The stomach filled with air, the folds flattened, and the lining looked normal. No hiatal hernia was seen.  \n- The pyloric valve (the opening to the small intestine) was normal.  \n- The first, second, and third parts of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) all looked normal.  \nBiopsies were taken from the second part of the duodenum, the antrum (lower stomach), and the lower esophagus at 22 cm from the front teeth. Two more biopsies were taken from the antrum for a CLO test (to look for H. pylori).  \nAir was removed from the stomach and the scope was taken out. The child tolerated this well.  \n\nThe child was turned and the scope was advanced to the terminal ileum (the last part of the small intestine). The lining of the ileum and the colon were normal except for a 1 × 1 cm growth on the rectum that looked like a juvenile polyp. Biopsies were taken from the terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum.  \nThe polyp was cut off at its base with a snare and 20 watts of pure coagulation was applied in short bursts three times. The polyp was removed without bleeding. The polyp head was suctioned out. Air was removed from the colon. The child tolerated the rest of the procedure well and was sent to recovery in good condition. Estimated blood loss was about 5 mL.\n\n**Impression:**  \nThe esophagus, stomach, duodenum, colon, and terminal ileum all looked normal except for a 1 × 1 cm rectal polyp, which was successfully removed.\n\n**Plan:**  \nThe biopsies and CLO test will be examined. The parents will be called next week with the results, and further steps will be discussed then."
