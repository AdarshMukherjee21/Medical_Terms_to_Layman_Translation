  "medical": "EXAM: Modified barium swallow. SYMPTOM: Dysphagia with possible aspiration. FINDINGS: A cookie deglutition study was performed. The patient was examined in the direct lateral position. Patient was challenged with thin liquids, thick liquid, semisolids and solids. Persistently demonstrable is the presence of penetration with thin liquids. This is not evident with thick liquids, semisolids or solids. There is weakness in the oral phase of deglutition. Subglottic region appears normal. There is no evidence of aspiration demonstrated. IMPRESSION: Penetration demonstrated with thin liquids with weakness of the oral phase of deglutition.",
  "layman": "Exam: Modified barium swallow test.  \nSymptom: Trouble swallowing and possible aspiration.  \n\nFindings: A swallow study using a cookie‑like test was done while the patient lay on their side. The patient was asked to swallow thin liquids, thick liquids, semi‑solid foods, and solid foods. Thin liquids consistently entered the airway (penetration). This did not happen with thick liquids, semi‑solids, or solids. The muscles used to start swallowing in the mouth are weak. The area below the vocal cords looks normal. No food or liquid went below the vocal cords (no aspiration).  \n\nImpression: Thin liquids cause airway penetration, and the mouth phase of swallowing is weak."
