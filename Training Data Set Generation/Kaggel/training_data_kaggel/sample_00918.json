TITLE OF PROCEDURE 1. Carpal tunnel release. 2. de Quervain's release. ANESTHESIA: MAC COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was made in line with the 4th ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease. The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis. The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially from 2-3 mm and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf. The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat. The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat. The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with scissors. After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl. Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture. A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed. The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches. The first dorsal compartment was addressed through a transverse incision at the level of the radial styloid tip. Dissection was carried down with care taken to avoid and protect the superficial radial nerve branches. I released the compartment in a separate subsheath for the EPB on the dorsal side. Both ends of the sheath were released to lengthen them, and then these were repaired with 4-0 Vicryl. It was checked to make sure that there was significant room remaining for the tendons. This was done to prevent postoperative subluxation. I then irrigated and closed the wounds in layers. Marcaine with epinephrine was placed into all wounds, and dressings and splint were placed. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",

De Quervain’s stenosing tenosynovitis.  \n\nTITLE OF PROCEDURE  \n1. Carpal tunnel release.  \n2. De Quervain’s release.  \n\nANESTHESIA: MAC (monitored anesthesia care)  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None  \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL  \nAfter giving the patient antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. The arm was drained of blood with an Esmarch band and a tourniquet was set to 250 mmHg. A long cut was made along the fourth finger line, from the top of the arm down to about 1 cm below the wrist crease. The surgeon went down to the thin outer layer of tissue. The fat under the skin was pulled away a few millimeters, and the outer layer was cut on the side closer to the thumb to leave a longer piece on the side toward the little finger. That longer piece was pulled toward the little finger, and the edge of the transverse carpal ligament was found with a clamp. The clamp was gently placed under the ligament to protect the nerves and tendons inside the tunnel, and the ligament was cut on the little‑finger side right onto the clamp. The forearm fascia was cut up close to the skin with scissors. The wound was washed well with normal saline. The cut edge of the ligament on the thumb side was sewn to the cut outer layer on the little‑finger side with 4‑0 Vicryl stitches, taking care not to trap the motor branch of the median nerve. A clamp was put under the repair to make sure the median nerve was not squeezed. The skin was closed with 5‑0 nylon stitches.  \n\nThe first dorsal compartment (the space that holds the thumb tendons) was treated through a short cut at the tip of the radial styloid. The tissue was carefully cut away while protecting the small branches of the radial nerve. The compartment was released in a separate layer for the extensor pollicis brevis tendon on the back of the hand. Both ends of the sheath were cut to lengthen it, then sewn back together with 4‑0 Vicryl. The surgeon checked that there was plenty of space left for the tendons, to avoid them slipping out after surgery. The wounds were irrigated again and closed in layers. A local anesthetic with epinephrine (Marcaine) was injected into all the wounds, and dressings and a splint were applied. The patient went to recovery in good condition and tolerated the procedure well."
