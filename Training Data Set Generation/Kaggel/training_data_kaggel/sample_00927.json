  "medical": "REASON FOR VISIT: Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy. I had last seen her on 06/21/07. At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy. She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07. At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI. I did not have any recent images. I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today. She states that her symptoms are unchanged. She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y. She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist. She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note. No significant right upper extremity symptoms. No bowel, bladder dysfunction. No difficulty with ambulation. FINDINGS: On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities. Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus. Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally. Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities. Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder. An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity. Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed. It is relatively limited study due to artifact. He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change. There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis. I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery. With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with. I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections. The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery. I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine. I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:** Follow‑up for a torn left rotator cuff and narrowing of the neck spine.\n\n**History of present illness:** Ms. ABC came back today to check on her left shoulder pain and the pain that radiates down her left arm (C6 nerve pain). I last saw her on 06/21/07. At that time, she was referred to Dr. X and Dr. Y to look at her left C6 nerve pain. She also has a large rotator cuff tear and is being considered for surgery on the left shoulder, probably around 07/20/07. During our last visit I only had her old cervical spine MRI report; I did not have new images. I sent her for a new cervical spine MRI and she returned today. She says her symptoms are the same. She still has strong pain in her left shoulder and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y. She also has pain that travels down her left arm to the wrist in a C6 pattern. She has a little weakness that was described in our earlier note. She has no problems on the right side, no bowel or bladder issues, and can walk normally.\n\n**Findings:** On exam, her left biceps and triceps are 4+ out of 5, her left deltoid is 4 out of 5, and all other upper‑arm muscles are 5 out of 5. Light touch is slightly reduced in the left C6 area; otherwise sensation is fine. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1+. Hoffmann sign is normal on both sides. Lower‑leg muscles are 5 out of 5. The Hawkins and Neer tests are positive for shoulder impingement on the left. An EMG done on 06/08/07 showed no nerve root or plexus problems on the left. The cervical MRI from 06/28/07 is limited because of motion, but it shows mild‑to‑moderate narrowing at C5‑C6 without pressure on the spinal cord. There is a left disc bulge at C5‑C6, though the images are not clear.\n\n**Assessment and plan:** Ms. ABC’s history, exam, and imaging all point to pain in her left shoulder and left arm caused by a torn rotator cuff and moderate neck spine narrowing. I agree that she should go ahead with the shoulder surgery. For the nerve pain, I think we can try non‑surgical treatment first. I will refer her for cervical epidural steroid injections, which may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery. I will see her again in 3 months, after her shoulder surgery, to see if she still needs treatment for her neck. I will also contact Dr. Y before her surgery in a few weeks to share this information."
