  "medical": "INDICATIONS: Abnormal EKG. STRESS TECHNIQUE: Dobutrex was infused at 10 &micro;g/kg/minute increasing in three-minute intervals. Maximum heart rate was 113. No significant EKG changes noted. NARRATIVE: Uptake of radioisotope was adequate in all views. There was an inferior abnormality noted in the short axis view from 4:00-6:30. In the vertical long axis view, there was an inferior abnormality with minimal improvement. The horizontal long axis view had a lateral apical abnormality with no change. WALL MOTION: The left ventricle was of normal size and motion. All wall segments moved normally. EJECTION FRACTION: 72%. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Negative Dobutrex stress test. 2. Normal wall motion and ejection fraction. 3. Abnormal nuclear scan consistent with possible underlying ischemic heart disease. Clinical correlation suggested.",
  "layman": "**INDICATIONS:** Abnormal EKG.  \n\n**STRESS TEST:** Dobutrex was given at 10 µg/kg/min and increased every 3 minutes. The highest heart rate reached was 113. The EKG did not show any major changes.  \n\n**NARRATIVE:** The radioactive tracer was taken up well in all views. In the short‑axis view (4:00‑6:30), there was an abnormal area at the bottom of the heart. In the vertical long‑axis view, the same bottom abnormality showed only a little improvement. In the horizontal long‑axis view, there was an abnormal area at the side of the heart’s tip that did not change.  \n\n**WALL MOTION:** The left ventricle is the normal size and moves normally. All wall segments are moving normally.  \n\n**EJECTION FRACTION:** 72%.  \n\n**CONCLUSIONS:**  \n1. The Dobutrex stress test was negative.  \n2. The heart’s wall motion and pumping ability are normal.  \n3. The nuclear scan shows an abnormal area that could be due to heart disease, and further clinical evaluation is recommended."
