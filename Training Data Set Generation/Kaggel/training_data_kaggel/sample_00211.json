  "medical": "FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Herniated nucleuses pulposus, C5-6 greater than C6-7, left greater than C4-5 right with left radiculopathy. 2. Moderate stenosis C5-6. OPERATION: On 06/25/07, anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-5, C5-6, C6-7 using Bengal cages and Slimlock plate C4 to C7; intraoperative x-ray. This is a 60-year-old white male who was in the office on 05/01/07 because of neck pain with left radiculopathy and &quot;tension headaches.&quot; In the last year or so, he has had more and more difficulty and more recently has developed tingling and numbness into the fingers of the left hand greater than right. He has some neck pain at times and has seen Dr. X for an epidural steroid injection, which was very helpful. More recently he saw Dr. Y and went through some physical therapy without much relief. Cervical MRI scan was obtained and revealed a large right-sided disc herniation at C4-5 with significant midline herniations at C5-6 and a large left HNP at C6-7. In view of the multiple levels of pathology, I was not confident that anything short of surgical intervention would give him significant relief. The procedure and its risk were fully discussed and he decided to proceed with the operation. HOSPITAL COURSE: Following admission, the procedure was carried out without difficulty. Blood loss was about 125 cc. Postop x-ray showed good alignment and positioning of the cages, plate, and screws. After surgery, he was able to slowly increase his activity level with assistance from physical therapy. He had some muscle spasm and soreness between the shoulder blades and into the back part of his neck. He also had some nausea with the PCA. He had a low-grade fever to 100.2 and was started on incentive spirometry. Over the next 12 hours, his fever resolved and he was able to start getting up and around much more easily. By 06/27/07, he was ready to go home. He has been counseled regarding wound care and has received a neck sheet for instruction. He will be seen in two weeks for wound check and for a followup evaluation/x-rays in about six weeks. He has prescriptions for Lortab 7.5 mg and Robaxin 750 mg. He is to call if there are any problems.",
  "layman": "**FINAL DIAGNOSES**  \n1. Herniated discs in the neck: the disc between C5 and C6 is more damaged than the one between C6 and C7, and the left side is worse than the right side at C4‑C5. This is causing pain and tingling on the left side of the body.  \n2. Moderate narrowing of the spinal canal at C5‑C6.  \n\n**OPERATION**  \nOn June 25 2007 the patient had a front‑side neck surgery. The surgeon removed the damaged discs at C4‑C5, C5‑C6, and C6‑C7 and then fused those levels together using special cages and a plate that runs from C4 to C7. X‑rays were taken during the operation.  \n\n**PATIENT BACKGROUND**  \nThe 60‑year‑old man came to the office on May 1 2007 with neck pain, tingling in his left hand, and “tension headaches.” Over the past year his symptoms worsened, especially tingling and numbness in his left fingers. He had tried an epidural steroid injection that helped a bit, but physical therapy did not relieve his pain. An MRI showed a large disc bulge on the right at C4‑C5, big bulges at C5‑C6, and a large left bulge at C6‑C7. Because the problems were at several levels, the doctor explained that only surgery could likely give him relief. The patient agreed to the operation.  \n\n**HOSPITAL COURSE**  \nAfter admission the surgery went smoothly. About 125 cc of blood was lost. X‑rays after the operation showed the cages, plate, and screws were in good place.  \n\nPost‑op, the patient slowly started moving with help from physical therapy. He had muscle spasms and soreness between the shoulder blades and at the back of his neck. He also felt nauseous from the pain‑control medication. He had a low fever (100.2 °F) and was given incentive spirometry to help his breathing. The fever went away within 12 hours, and he was able to get up and walk more easily.  \n\nBy June 27 2007 he was ready to go home. He was taught how to care for his wound and was given a neck sheet with instructions. He will return in two weeks for a wound check and in about six weeks for a follow‑up visit and X‑rays. He was given prescriptions for Lortab 7.5 mg and Robaxin 750 mg. He was told to call if he has any problems."
