  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy. INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla. MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia. The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn. FINDINGS: 1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken. 2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained. 3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. NPO except ice chips today. 2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy. 3. Follow up biopsies and cytology.",
  "layman": "**Procedure:** Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with brush cytology and biopsy.\n\n**Why the procedure was done:** The patient has long‑standing abdominal pain and a CT scan that shows chronic pancreatitis. A recent upper endoscopy found an abnormal ampulla (the opening where the bile and pancreatic ducts enter the small intestine).\n\n**Medications:** The patient was given general anesthesia. The doctor explained the risks, which include reactions to medication, bleeding, a hole in the intestine, inhaling food or liquid into the lungs, and pancreatitis after the ERCP.\n\n**What was done:**  \n1. After the patient gave consent and was sedated, a duodenoscope was passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach.  \n2. The scope was moved through the pylorus into the duodenum to reach the ampulla.  \n3. The ampulla looked very abnormal – it was enlarged, bulging, and almost like a polyp. The tip had a growth‑like surface and an ulcer.  \n4. The openings for the bile and pancreatic ducts were found, but they were located toward the base of the ampulla, not the tip.  \n5. A Wilson‑Cooke TriTome sphincterotome was used to open the bile duct easily.  \n6. The common bile duct was slightly enlarged (about 12 mm). The small ducts inside the liver were only mildly enlarged. No blockages were seen. A possible narrowing in the lower part of the bile duct was noted, but this may just be an anatomical variation because of the ampulla’s shape.  \n7. Because the patient had no signs of blockage, the doctor still took a brush sample from this area. This was done safely.  \n8. The bile duct drained well during the procedure.  \n9. Attempts were made to reach the pancreatic duct, but the shape of the ampulla made it impossible, even with a longer scope.  \n10. Four biopsies were taken from the ampulla away from the bile duct opening. A little bleeding stopped by the end of the procedure.  \n11. The stomach was emptied and the scope was removed.\n\n**Findings:**  \n1. The ampulla is abnormal, bulging, polyp‑like, with growth‑like tissue and an ulcer; biopsies were taken.  \n2. The bile duct is mildly enlarged (12 mm) and may have a narrowing in the lower part, likely an anatomical variant; a brush sample was taken.  \n3. The pancreatic duct could not be accessed.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n1. No food or drink today except ice chips.  \n2. An MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) will be done to better see the pancreatic ducts.  \n3. The biopsy and cytology results will be followed up."
