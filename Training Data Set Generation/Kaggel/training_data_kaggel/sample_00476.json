  "medical": "CC: Progressive lower extremity weakness. HX: This 52y/o RHF had a h/o right frontal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection, on 1/15/1991. She had been healthy until 1/6/91, when she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure during the night. She subsequently underwent an MRI brain scan and was found to have a right frontal enhancing lesion in the mesial aspect of the right frontal lobe at approximately the level of the coronal suture. There was minimal associated edema and no mass effect. Following extirpation of the tumor mass, she underwent radioactive Iodine implantation and 6020cGy radiation therapy in 35 fractions. In 11/91 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy protocols. This was followed by four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (3/92, 6/92, 9/92 ,10/92) chemotherapy. On 10/12/92 she presented for her 4th course of 5FU/Carboplatin and complained of non-radiating dull low back pain, and proximal lower extremity weakness, but was still able to ambulate. She denied any bowel/bladder difficulty. PMH: s/p oral surgery for wisdom tooth extraction. FHX/SHX: 1-2 ppd cigarettes. rare ETOH use. Father died of renal CA. MEDS: Decadron 12mg/day. EXAM: Vitals unremarkable. MS: Unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE, LE: 4+/5- prox, 5/5 distal to hips. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: No deficits appreciated. Coord: Unremarkable. Station: No mention in record of being tested. Gait: Mild difficulty climbing stairs. Reflexes: 1+/1+ throughout and symmetric. Plantar responses were down-going bilaterally. INITIAL IMPRESSION: Steroid myopathy. Though there was enough of a suspicion of &quot;drop&quot; metastasis that an MRI of the L-spine was obtained. COURSE: The MRI L-spine revealed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. No focal mass or cord compression was visualized. CSF examination revealed: 19RBC, 22WBC, 17 Lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, Glucose 56, Protein 150. Cytology (negative). The patient was discharged home on 10/17/92, but experienced worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness and became predominantly wheelchair bound within 4 months. She was last seen on 3/3/93 and showed signs of worsening weakness (left hemiplegia: R &gt; L) as her tumor grew and spread. She then entered a hospice.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: progressive weakness in her legs.\n\nHistory: A 52‑year‑old right‑handed woman had a brain tumor called glioblastoma in the right frontal lobe. It was found by biopsy and partially removed on January 15, 1991. She was healthy until January 6, 1991, when she had a generalized seizure at night. An MRI showed a tumor in the right frontal lobe with only a little swelling and no pressure on the brain. After the tumor was removed, she received radioactive iodine treatment and 6,020 cGy of radiation in 35 sessions. In November 1991 she was given BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy. She then had four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (March, June, September, and October 1992). On October 12, 1992, during her fourth chemotherapy session, she reported dull low back pain and weakness in the upper part of her legs, but she could still walk. She had no bowel or bladder problems. Past medical history: wisdom‑tooth extraction. Family/social history: smokes 1–2 cigarettes a day, drinks alcohol rarely. Father died of kidney cancer. Medications: Decadron 12 mg daily.\n\nExam: Vital signs normal. Mental status normal. Muscle strength: arms 5/5, legs 4+/5‑ in the upper part, 5/5 in the lower part. Muscle tone and size normal. Sensation normal. Coordination normal. Gait: slight trouble climbing stairs. Reflexes 1+/1+ everywhere, symmetrical. Plantar reflexes normal.\n\nInitial impression: muscle weakness from steroids. Because of concern that the tumor might have spread to the spine, an MRI of the lower spine was done. The MRI showed a thin line of enhancement along the back of the spinal cord tip, suggesting tumor cells in the fluid around the spinal cord. No mass or compression was seen. CSF test: 19 red cells, 22 white cells, 17 lymphocytes, 5 histiocytes, glucose 56, protein 150. No tumor cells were found. She was sent home on October 17, 1992, but her back pain and leg weakness worsened and she became mostly wheelchair‑bound within four months. She was last seen on March 3, 1993, with worsening weakness (right side stronger than left) as the tumor grew and spread. She then entered hospice care."
