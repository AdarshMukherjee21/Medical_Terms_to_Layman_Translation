  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal both-bone forearm fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal both-bone forearm fracture. PROCEDURE: Closed reduction with splint application with use of image intensifier. INDICATIONS: Mr. ABC is an 11-year-old boy who sustained a fall on 07/26/2008. Evaluation in the emergency department revealed both-bone forearm fracture. Considering the amount of angulation, it was determined that we should proceed with conscious sedation and closed reduction. After discussion with parents, verbal and written consent was obtained. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was induced with propofol for conscious sedation via the emergency department staff. After it was confirmed that appropriate sedation had been reached, a longitudinal traction in conjunction with re-creation of the injury maneuver was applied reducing the fracture. Subsequently, this was confirmed with image intensification, a sugar-tong splint was applied and again reduction was confirmed with image intensifier. The patient was aroused from anesthesia and tolerated the procedure well. Post-reduction plain films revealed some anterior displacement of the distal fragment. At this time, it was determined this fracture proved to be unstable. DISPOSITION: After review of the reduction films, it appears that there is some element of fracture causing displacement. We will proceed to the operating room for open reduction and internal fixation versus closed reduction and percutaneous pinning as our operative schedule allows.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The boy’s left forearm was broken in both bones near the wrist.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The same left forearm break.  \n\nPROCEDURE: We straightened the broken bones without surgery and put a splint on the arm while using X‑ray guidance.  \n\nINDICATIONS: Mr. ABC is an 11‑year‑old boy who fell on July 26, 2008. In the emergency room we saw that both bones in his left forearm were broken. Because the bones were angled too much, we decided to use conscious sedation and try to straighten them without surgery. After talking with his parents, we got verbal and written permission.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The boy was given propofol by the emergency staff to keep him calm but awake. Once we confirmed he was properly sedated, we pulled on the arm and used the same motion that caused the break to try to line up the bones. X‑ray images showed the bones were straightened, so we put a sugar‑tong splint on the arm and checked again with X‑ray. The boy woke up from the sedation and handled the procedure well. After the straightening, X‑ray films showed that the lower part of the broken bone was still a little pushed forward. This means the break is unstable.  \n\nDISPOSITION: After reviewing the X‑ray images, we see that the break is still displaced. We will take the boy to the operating room for either open surgery to fix the bones or a less invasive procedure with pins, depending on when we can schedule the operation."
