He states he has not had any treatment for this problem. He just does take Aleve. He states that he began to wear a back brace, which only helps him some. He says his pain is pretty manageable and low when he is not active, but it does increase with more activity that he does.

Cranial nerves II, III, IV, and VI, vision intact, visual fields full to confrontation, EOMs full bilaterally, and pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Cranial nerves V and VII, normal facial sensation and symmetrical facial movements. Cranial nerve VIII, hearing is intact. Cranial nerves IX, X, and XII, tongue protrudes midline and palate elevates symmetrically. Cardiac, regular rate, a holosystolic murmur is also noted which is about grade 1 to 2. Chest and lungs are clear bilaterally. Skin is warm and dry, normal turgor and texture. No rashes or lesions are noted. Peripheral vascular, no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema is noted.

He is able to ambulate on his toes and his heels without any weakness noted. He has negative straight leg raising bilaterally. FINDINGS: The patient brings in lumbar spine MRI for 11/15/2007, which demonstrates degenerative disc disease throughout. At L4-L5 and L5-S1 he has severe disc space narrowing. At L3-L4, he has degenerative changes of the facet with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and annular disc bulge, which caused moderate neuroforaminal narrowing. At L4-L5, degenerative changes within the facets with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy as well causing neuroforaminal narrowing and central stenosis. At L5-S1, there is an annular disc bulge more to the right causing right-sided neuroforaminal stenosis, which is quite severe compared to that on the left. ASSESSMENT: Low back pain, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, diabetes, and history of prostate cancer status post radiation. PLAN: We discussed treatment options with this patient including: 1. Do nothing. 2. Conservative therapies. 3. Surgery. The patient states that his pain is very well tolerated by minimizing his activity and would like to do just pain management with some pain pills only as needed. We went ahead and obtained an EKG in the office today due to the fact that I heard a murmur on exam. I did phone the patient's primary care doctor, Dr. O. Unfortunately Dr. O is out of the country, and I did speak with Dr. K, who is covering for Dr. O. I informed Dr. K that the patient had a new-onset murmur and that I did have some concerns for the patient does not recollect having this diagnosis before, so I obtained an EKG. A copy was provided to the patient and the patient was referred back to his primary care physician for workup. He was also released from our care at this time to a p.r.n. basis, but the patient does not wish to proceed with any neurosurgical intervention nor any conservative measures besides medications, which he will receive from his primary doctor. All questions and concerns were addressed. If he should have any further questions, concerns, or complications, he will contact our office immediately. Otherwise, we will see him p.r.n. Warning signs and symptoms were gone over with him. Case was reviewed and discussed with Dr. L.",
  "layman": "Mr. X is an 84‑year‑old retired man who was sent to our office by Dr. O. He came in because he has had lower back pain for about six to eight months. He lives in the area but also travels to Iowa where he spends a lot of time with his grandchildren, does shopping, walks a lot, and recently cut down some trees. He says the pain started in his back and hips and makes it hard to get up from a chair. He has not had any treatment except taking Aleve and wearing a back brace, which only helps a little. The pain is usually low when he is resting but gets worse when he is more active. He is very reluctant to have surgery because his brother died from complications of back surgery. The pain comes and goes; on a 1‑to‑10 scale he rates it a 2. He only gets relief when lying down. Walking or exercising makes it worse. He has no pain that shoots down his legs.\n\n**Family history**  \nBoth parents are deceased. He has two brothers, ages 68 and 77, who are healthy. He had twin siblings who died at birth. He has two sons, ages 54 and 57, who are healthy. His family has a history of diabetes and heart attacks.\n\n**Social history**  \nHe is married and has family support at home. He does not smoke or use illegal drugs. He drinks two to three alcoholic drinks a day, up to four to nine drinks a week.\n\n**Allergies**  \nGaramycin.\n\n**Current medications**  \n- Insulin 20‑25 units twice a day  \n- Lorazepam 0.05 mg (he stopped it recently)  \n- Glipizide 5 mg with each meal  \n- Advair 250 µg as needed  \n- Aspirin once a day  \n- Cod liver oil twice a day  \n- Centrum AZ once a day  \n\n**Past medical history**  \nHe has had diabetes for 35 years and has been on insulin for the last 20 years. He also had prostate cancer that was treated with radiation; his PSA is 0.01. In 1985 he had a testicle removed because it was enlarged, not cancer.\n\n**Review of systems**  \nHe is right‑handed. He reports shortness of breath, frequent urination, but no bowel or bladder problems. He has no loss of sensation or erectile problems. All other systems are normal.\n\n**Physical exam**  \n- Height 5’10”, weight 204 lb (down from 212 lb a year ago)  \n- Blood pressure 130/66, pulse 78  \n- Alert, oriented, speaks normally, not in pain at the moment  \n- Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat normal  \n- Mild heart murmur (grade 1‑2)  \n- Lungs clear  \n- Skin warm and dry, no swelling  \n- Walks normally with no limp  \n- Lower back not tender  \n- Reflexes normal  \n- Slight loss of pin‑prick sensation on the right lower leg, but strength 5/5 in both legs  \n- Straight‑leg raise negative  \n\n**Imaging**  \nAn MRI from 2007 shows degenerative disc disease throughout the lumbar spine. The discs at L4‑L5 and L5‑S1 are severely narrowed. There are changes in the facet joints and thickening of the ligament that narrow the spaces where nerves exit. The right side at L5‑S1 is especially narrowed.\n\n**Assessment**  \nLower back pain, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, diabetes, and a history of prostate cancer treated with radiation.\n\n**Plan**  \nWe talked about three options: do nothing, conservative treatments, or surgery. The patient prefers to keep activity low and use pain medication only as needed. He does not want surgery or other conservative measures. We did an ECG because of the new heart murmur and sent the results to his primary doctor. He was given a prescription for pain medication and told to call us if he has any problems. He will see us only as needed. We reviewed warning signs of serious problems and discussed the case with Dr. L."
