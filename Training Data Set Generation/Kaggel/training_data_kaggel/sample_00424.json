  "medical": "REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Hematuria and urinary retention. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 82-year-old, who was admitted with the history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, presented with urinary retention and pneumonia. The patient had hematuria, and unable to void. The patient had a Foley catheter, which was not in the urethra, possibly inflated in the prostatic urethra, which was removed. Foley catheter was repositioned 18 Coude was used. About over a liter of fluids of urine was obtained with light pink urine, which was irrigated. The bladder and the suprapubic area returned to normal after the Foley placement. The patient had some evidence of clots upon irrigation. The patient has had a chest CT, which showed possible atelectasis versus pneumonia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Parkinson's, and CHF. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: Married and lives with wife. HABITS: No smoking or drinking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies any chest pain, denies any seizure disorder, denies any nausea, vomiting. Does have suprapubic tenderness and difficulty voiding. The patient denies any prior history of hematuria, dysuria, burning, or pain. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile. Vitals are stable. GENERAL: The patient is a thin gentleman GENITOURINARY: Suprapubic area was distended and bladder was palpated very easily. Prostate was 1+. Testes are normal. LABORATORY DATA: The patient's white counts are 20,000. Creatinine is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Pneumonia. 2. Dehydration. 3. Retention. 4. BPH. 5. Diabetes. 6. Hyperlipidemia. 7. Parkinson's. 8. Congestive heart failure. About 30 minutes were spent during the procedure and the Foley catheter was placed, Foley was irrigated and significant amount of clots were obtained. Plan is for urine culture, antibiotics. Plan is for renal ultrasound to rule out any pathology. The patient will need cystoscopy and evaluation of the prostate. Apparently, the patient's PSA is 0.45, so the patient is at low to no risk of prostate cancer at this time. Continued Foley catheter at this point. We will think about starting the patient on alpha-blockers once the patient's over all medical condition is improved and stable.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:** Blood in urine and trouble urinating.  \n\n**Brief history:**  \nAn 82‑year‑old man with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease was admitted because he could not urinate and had pneumonia. He had blood in his urine and could not empty his bladder. A Foley catheter was inserted but was not in the correct spot, probably stuck in the prostate area, so it was removed. The catheter was then put back in correctly using a 18‑French Coude tip. About one liter of light pink urine was drained and the bladder and lower abdomen returned to normal. Some blood clots were seen during the drainage. A chest CT scan showed either collapsed lung tissue or pneumonia.  \n\n**Past medical history:** Coronary artery disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Parkinson’s disease, and congestive heart failure.  \n\n**Family history:** Not significant.  \n\n**Social history:** Married, lives with wife. Does not smoke or drink.  \n\n**Review of systems:** No chest pain, seizures, nausea, or vomiting. Has tenderness below the belly button and difficulty urinating. No previous blood in urine, painful urination, or burning.  \n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Vitals: No fever, stable.  \n- General: Thin man.  \n- Genitourinary: Lower abdomen was swollen and the bladder was easy to feel. Prostate was slightly enlarged (1+). Testes normal.  \n\n**Labs:** White blood cell count 20,000; creatinine normal.  \n\n**Assessment and plan:**  \n1. Pneumonia.  \n2. Dehydration.  \n3. Urinary retention.  \n4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  \n5. Diabetes.  \n6. High cholesterol.  \n7. Parkinson’s.  \n8. Congestive heart failure.  \n\nThe catheter procedure took about 30 minutes. The catheter was flushed and many blood clots were removed. The plan is to do a urine culture and give antibiotics. A kidney ultrasound will be done to check for any problems. The patient will need a cystoscopy to look at the bladder and prostate. His PSA level is 0.45, indicating low risk for prostate cancer. The catheter will stay in place for now. We will consider starting alpha‑blocker medication once his overall health improves and is stable."
