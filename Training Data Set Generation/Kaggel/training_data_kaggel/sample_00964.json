  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Achilles tendon rupture, left lower extremity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Achilles tendon rupture, left lower extremity. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Primary repair left Achilles tendon. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 40 minutes at 325 mmHg. POSITION: Prone. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 26-year-old African-American male who states that he was stepping off a hilo at work when he felt a sudden pop in the posterior aspect of his left leg. The patient was placed in posterior splint and followed up at ABC orthopedics for further care. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, the operative surgeon, Department Of Anesthesia, and nursing staff. While in this hospital, the Department Of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient. The patient was then transferred to the operative table and placed in the prone position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time. Left lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Once this was done, the left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept up for a total of 40 minutes. After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal. Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon. Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally. Next, retractor was placed. All neurovascular structures were protected. A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon. There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point. The plantar tendon was noted to be intact. The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon. Wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair. Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed. Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon. The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection. Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon. The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried. A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin. Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position. At this time, the Department of anesthesia reversed the anesthetic. The patient was transferred back to hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.",

He was put in a posterior splint and later came to ABC Orthopedics for further treatment.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nAfter explaining all possible risks, complications, and benefits, the patient gave informed consent. The surgical team confirmed the leg to be operated on. The anesthesiology team gave the patient general anesthesia. The patient was moved to the operating table and lay face‑down with all bony points padded. A tourniquet was placed on the upper left thigh but not yet inflated. The leg was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The leg was then raised and blood was removed with an Esmarch bandage, after which the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept for 40 minutes.  \n\nA 6‑cm long cut was made just beside the Achilles tendon, starting from where it attaches to the heel and moving upward. The surgeon carefully cut down to the protective layer around the tendon (peritenon). Full‑thickness flaps were made on both sides, and a retractor was used to keep the area clear. All nerves and blood vessels were protected. A cut was made in the peritenon to expose the tendon. The tendon was completely torn about 4 cm above its attachment to the heel. The plantaris tendon was still intact. The torn ends and any blood clots were cleaned out. The wound was washed thoroughly and dried.  \n\nBecause enough tendon remained, the surgeon performed a primary repair. A #0 PDS suture on a taper needle was used to make a Krackow stitch, tying two sutures individually to bring the tendon ends together tightly. The peritenon was closed over the tendon with a #2‑0 Vicryl suture. The wound was washed and dried again. The skin and underlying tissue were closed with #2‑0 Vicryl sutures, followed by a #4‑0 subcuticular stitch on the skin. Steri‑Strips were applied, and a sterile dressing (4×4 gauze, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix) and a short fiberglass cast in a plantar (downward) position were placed.  \n\nAfter the anesthesia was reversed, the patient was moved to the recovery area. He tolerated the surgery well and had no complications."
