Fluent speech without dysarthria. CN II-XII: Unremarkable MOTOR: 5/5 throughout, including intrinsic muscles of hands. No atrophy or abnormal muscle tone. SENSORY: Decreased PP in third digit of left hand only (palmar and dorsal sides). STATION/GAIT/COORD: Unremarkable. REFLEXES: 1+ throughout, plantar responses were downgoing bilaterally. GEN EXAM: Unremarkable. Tinel's manuever elicited pain and numbness on the left. Phalens sign present on the left. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Left Carpal Tunnel Syndrome EMG/NCV: Unremarkable. MRI C-spine, 12/1/92: Congenitally small spinal canal is present. Superimposed on this is mild spondylosis and disc bulge at C6-7, C5-6, C4-5, and C3-4. There is moderate central spinal stenosis at C3-4. Intervertebral foramina at these levels appear widely patent. COURSE: The MRI findings did not correlate with the clinical findings and history. The patient was placed on Elavil and was subsequently lost to follow-up.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Numbness in the left middle finger and pain in the left wrist.  \n\n**History:** A 44‑year‑old man with a history of left hand pain came in with one month of numbness and pain in his left middle finger and wrist. The numbness started in the finger and spread to the wrist within a day. A few days later he began to feel pain in the wrist. He works as a cook and often cuts fish for long periods, which makes the symptoms worse. He has no problems with bowel or bladder, no neck pain, and no weakness.

The patient was started on Elavil (an antidepressant sometimes used for nerve pain) and was lost to follow‑up."
