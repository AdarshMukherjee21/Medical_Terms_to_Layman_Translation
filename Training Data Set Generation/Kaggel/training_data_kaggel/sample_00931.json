  "medical": "CC: Intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical, and torsional diplopia. HX: 70y/o RHM referred by Neuro-ophthalmology for evaluation of neuromuscular disease. In 7/91, he began experiencing intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical and torsional diplopia which was worse and frequent at the end of the day, and was eliminated when closing one either eye. An MRI Brain scan at that time was unremarkable. He was seen at UIHC Strabismus Clinic in 5/93 for these symptoms. On exam, he was found to have intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze, and consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze. This was felt to possibly represent Grave's disease. Thyroid function studies were unremarkable, but orbital echography suggested Graves orbitopathy. The patient was then seen in the Neuro-ophthalmology clinic on 12/23/92. His exam remained unchanged. He underwent Tensilon testing which was unremarkable. On 1/13/93, he was seen again in Neuro-ophthalmology. His exam remained relatively unchanged and repeat Tensilon testing was unremarkable. He then underwent a partial superior rectus resection, OD, with only mild improvement of his diplopia. During his 8/27/96 Neuro-ophthalmology clinic visit he was noted to have hypertropia OD with left pseudogaze palsy and a right ptosis. The ptosis improved upon administration of Tensilon and he was placed on Mestinon 30mg tid. His diplopia subsequently improved, but did not resolve. The dosage was increased to 60mg tid and his diplopia worsened and the dose decreased back to 30mg tid. At present he denied any fatigue on repetitive movement. He denied dysphagia, SOB, dysarthria, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or muscle atrophy. MEDS: Viokase, Probenecid, Mestinon 30mg tid. PMH: 1) Gastric ulcer 30 years ago, 2) Cholecystectomy, 3) Pancreatic insufficiency, 4) Gout, 5) Diplopia. FHX: Mother died age 89 of &quot;old age.&quot; Father died age 89 of stroke. Brother, age 74 with CAD, Sister died age 30 of cancer. SHX: Retired insurance salesman and denies history of tobacco or illicit drug us. He has no h/o ETOH abuse and does not drink at present. EXAM: BP 155/104. HR 92. RR 12. Temp 34.6C. WT 76.2kg. MS: Unremarkable. Normal speech with no dysarthria. CN: Right hypertropia (worse on rightward gaze and less on leftward gaze). Minimal to no ptosis, OD. No ptosis, OS. VFFTC. No complaint of diplopia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. SENSORY: No deficits appreciated on PP/VIB/LT/PROP/TEMP testing. Coordination/Station/Gait: Unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor on the right and withdrawal on the left. HEENT and GEN EXAM: Unremarkable. COURSE: EMG/NCV, 9/26/96: Repetitive stimulation studies of the median, facial, and spinal accessory nerves showed no evidence of decrement at baseline, and at intervals up to 3 minutes following exercise. The patient had been off Mestinon for 8 hours prior to testing. Chest CT with contrast, 9/26/96, revealed a 4x2.5x4cm centrally calcified soft tissue anterior mediastinal mass adjacent to the aortic arch. This was highly suggestive of a thymoma. There were diffuse emphysematous disease with scarring in the lung bases. A few nodules suggestive of granulomas and few calcified perihilar lymph nodes. He underwent thoracotomy and resection of the mass. Pathologic analysis was consistent with a thymoma, lymphocyte predominant type, with capsular and pleural invasion, and extension to the phrenic nerve resection margin. Acetylcholine Receptor-binding antibody titer 12.8nmol/L (normal&lt;0.7), Acetylcholine receptor blocking antibody &lt;10% (normal), Acetylcholine receptor modulating antibody 42% (normal&lt;19), Striated muscle antibody 1:320 (normal&lt;1:10). Striated muscle antibody titers tend to be elevated in myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma. He was subsequently treated with XRT and continued to complain of fatigue at his 4/18/97 Oncology visit.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint**  \nThe patient has double vision that comes and goes. It can be side‑to‑side, up‑and‑down, or twisted.  \n\n**History**  \nA 70‑year‑old man was referred for a possible neuromuscular problem. In July 1991 he began having intermittent double vision that got worse by the end of the day and disappeared when he closed one eye. A brain MRI at that time was normal.  \n\nIn May 1993 he was seen at a strabismus clinic. The exam showed the right eye looking slightly upward (right hypertropia) when looking straight ahead, and double vision when looking down or to the right. The doctors thought this might be related to Graves disease. Thyroid blood tests were normal, but an eye ultrasound suggested Graves eye disease.  \n\nHe was seen again in December 1992; the exam was unchanged. A Tensilon test (used to check for myasthenia gravis) was normal. In January 1993 the exam was still the same and a repeat Tensilon test was normal.  \n\nHe had surgery to shorten the right superior rectus muscle, which only slightly helped the double vision.  \n\nIn August 1996 he had right eye misalignment, a left eye “pseudo‑gaze” palsy, and right eyelid droop. The droop improved with Tensilon, so he was started on Mestinon 30 mg three times a day. The double vision improved but did not go away. Increasing Mestinon to 60 mg three times a day made the double vision worse, so the dose was lowered back to 30 mg.  \n\nHe reports no fatigue when moving his eyes repeatedly. He denies trouble swallowing, shortness of breath, speech problems, facial weakness, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or muscle wasting.  \n\n**Medications**  \n- Viokase  \n- Probenecid  \n- Mestinon 30 mg three times a day  \n\n**Past medical history**  \n- Gastric ulcer (30 years ago)  \n- Gallbladder removal  \n- Pancreatic insufficiency  \n- Gout  \n- Double vision  \n\n**Family history**  \n- Mother died at 89 of “old age”  \n- Father died at 89 of stroke  \n- Brother (74) has coronary artery disease  \n- Sister died at 30 of cancer  \n\n**Social history**  \nRetired insurance salesman. No tobacco or illicit drug use. No alcohol abuse and does not drink now.  \n\n**Physical exam**  \n- Blood pressure 155/104  \n- Heart rate 92  \n- Respirations 12  \n- Temperature 34.6 °C  \n- Weight 76.2 kg  \n\nMuscle strength 5/5 everywhere, normal tone. Speech normal.  \nRight eye misalignment worse when looking right, less when looking left. Minimal or no drooping of the right eyelid; none on the left. No double vision reported. All other cranial nerves normal.  \nSensation normal. Coordination, stance, and gait normal. Reflexes 2/2. Plantar responses normal. Head, neck, and general exam normal.  \n\n**Course of investigation and treatment**  \n- EMG/NCV on 26 Sept 1996 showed no weakness after exercise; the patient had stopped Mestinon 8 hours before the test.  \n- Chest CT on the same day revealed a 4 × 2.5 × 4 cm calcified mass in the front of the chest near the aortic arch, highly suggestive of a thymoma. There was also lung scarring, small nodules, and calcified lymph nodes.  \n- He had surgery to remove the mass. Pathology confirmed a lymphocyte‑predominant thymoma that had invaded the capsule, pleura, and reached the phrenic nerve margin.  \n- Blood tests:  \n  - Acetylcholine receptor binding antibody 12.8 nmol/L (high)  \n  - Blocking antibody <10 % (normal)  \n  - Modulating antibody 42 % (high)  \n  - Striated muscle antibody 1:320 (high)  \n\nThese antibodies are often elevated in myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma.  \n- He received radiation therapy and still had fatigue at his oncology visit on 18 Apr 1997."
