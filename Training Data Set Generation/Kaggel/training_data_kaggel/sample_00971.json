  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Trigger finger release. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was made over the digit's A1 pulley. Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles. The sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release it under direct vision from the proximal extent of the A1 pulley to just proximal to the proximal digital crease. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The tendons were identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained. The patient then actively moved the digit, and no triggering was noted. After irrigating out the wound with copious amounts of sterile saline, the skin was closed with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures. The wound was dressed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURE: Trigger finger release. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After giving the right antibiotics and local anesthesia, the arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. The arm was drained of blood with an Esmarch bandage, and a tourniquet was tightened to 250 mmHg. A long cut was made over the A1 pulley of the finger. The surgeon carefully cut down to the flexor sheath, making sure to protect the nerves and blood vessels. The sheath was opened with a scalpel, and then scissors were used to cut it from the start of the A1 pulley to just before the first crease of the finger. Bleeding was controlled with a bipolar cautery device. The tendons were gently pulled to make sure the finger no longer caught. The patient then moved the finger, and it moved smoothly. After washing the wound with plenty of sterile salt water, the skin was stitched closed with 5-0 nylon simple stitches. The wound was dressed and the patient was taken to recovery in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
