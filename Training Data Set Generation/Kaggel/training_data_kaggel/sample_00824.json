  "medical": "PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following premedication with Vistaril 50 mg and Atropine 0.4 mg IM, the patient received Versed 5.0 mg intravenously after Cetacaine spray to the posterior palate. The Olympus video gastroscope was then introduced into the upper esophagus and passed by direct vision to the descending duodenum. The upper, mid and lower portions of the esophagus; the lesser and greater curves of the stomach; anterior and posterior walls; body and antrum; pylorus; duodenal bulb; and duodenum were all normal. No evidence of friability, ulceration or tumor mass was encountered. The instrument was withdrawn to the antrum, and biopsies taken for CLO testing, and then the instrument removed.",
  "layman": "Procedure in detail: After the patient was given Vistaril 50 mg and Atropine 0.4 mg by injection into the muscle, they received Versed 5 mg through a vein after a spray of Cetacaine on the back of the mouth. A video scope (Olympus) was then inserted into the upper esophagus and guided by sight all the way to the lower part of the duodenum. The scope examined the upper, middle, and lower esophagus; the inner and outer curves of the stomach; the front and back walls; the body and lower part (antrum); the opening to the small intestine (pylorus); the first part of the small intestine (duodenal bulb); and the rest of the duodenum. All of these areas looked normal. No signs of bleeding, sores, or tumors were found. The scope was pulled back to the antrum, where tissue samples were taken for a CLO test, and then the scope was removed."
