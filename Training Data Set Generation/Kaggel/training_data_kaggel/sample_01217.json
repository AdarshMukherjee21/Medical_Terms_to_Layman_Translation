  "medical": "CC: Bilateral lower extremity numbness. HX: 21 y/o RHM complained of gradual onset numbness and incoordination of both lower extremities beginning approximately 11/5/96. The symptoms became maximal over a 12-24 hour period and have not changed since. The symptoms consist of tingling in the distal lower extremities approximately half way up the calf bilaterally. He noted decreased coordination of both lower extremities which he thought might be due to uncertainty as to where his feet were being placed in space. He denied bowel/bladder problems, or weakness or numbness elsewhere. Hot showers may improve his symptoms. He has suffered no recent flu-like illness. Past medical and family histories are unremarkable. He was on no medications. EXAM: Unremarkable except for mild distal vibratory sensation loss in the toes (R&gt;L). LAB: CBC, Gen Screen, TSH, FT4, SPE, ANA were all WNL. MRI L-SPINE: Normal. COURSE: Normal exam and diminished symptoms at following visit 4/23/93.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: numbness in both legs.  \nHistory: A 21‑year‑old man noticed numbness and trouble moving his legs that started around November 5, 1996.

He has no bowel or bladder problems, no weakness or numbness elsewhere, and no recent flu‑like illness. Warm showers seem to help. He has no other medical problems and no family history of similar issues. He is not taking any medications.  \n\nExam: normal except for a slight loss of vibration sense in his toes, worse on the right than the left.  \n\nLabs: complete blood count, general screen, thyroid tests, protein electrophoresis, and ANA were all normal.  \n\nMRI of the lower spine was normal.  \n\nCourse: At his next visit on April 23, 1993, his exam was normal and his symptoms had lessened."
