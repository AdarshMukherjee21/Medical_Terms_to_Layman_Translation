  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rotated cuff tear, right shoulder. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Rotated cuff tear, right shoulder. 2. Glenoid labrum tear. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopy with arthroscopic glenoid labrum debridement. 2. Subacromial decompression. 3. Rotator cuff repair, right shoulder. SPECIFICATIONS: Intraoperative procedure was done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #1 at ABCD Hospital. This was done under interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beach chair position. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: The patient is a 48-year-old with male who has been suffering increasing right shoulder pain for a number of months prior to surgical intervention. He was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. After discussing the alternative care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above stated procedure on this date. Intraarticularly, the joint was observed. There was noted to be a degenerative glenoid labrum tear. The biceps complex was otherwise intact. There were minimal degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint. Rotator cuff tear was appreciated on the inner surface. Subacromially, the same was true. This was an elliptical to V-type tear. The patient has a grossly positive type III acromion. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine on the operating table after receiving interscalene and then general anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department. He was safely placed in modified beach chair position. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Portals were created outside to end, posterior to anterior, and ultimately laterally in the typical fashion. Upon complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint, a 4.2 meniscus shaver was placed anteriorly with the scope posteriorly. Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum. The biceps was probed and noted to be intact. Undersurface of the rotator cuff was debrided with the shaver along with debridement of the subchondral region of the greater tuberosity attachment. After this, instrumentation was removed. The scope was placed subacromially and a lateral portal created. Gross bursectomy was carried out in a stepwise fashion to the top part of the cuff as well as in the gutters. An anterolateral portal was created. Sutures were placed via express silk as well as other sutures with a #2 fiber wire. With passing of the suture, they were tied with a slip-tight knot and then two half stitches. There was excellent reduction of the tear. Superolateral portal was then created. A #1 Mitek suture anchor was then placed in the posterior cuff to bring this over to bleeding bone. _______ suture was placed. The implant was put into place. The loop was grabbed and it was impacted in the previously drilled holes. There was excellent reduction of the tear. Trial range of motion was carried out and seemed to be satisfactory. Prior to this, a subacromial decompression was accomplished after release of CA ligament with the vapor Bovie. A 4.8 motorized barrel burr was utilized to sequentially take this down from the type III acromion to a flat type I acromion. After all was done, copious irrigation was carried out throughout the joint. Gross bursectomy lightly was carried out to remove all bony elements. A pain buster catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length. 0.5% Marcaine was instilled after portals were closed with #4-0 nylon. Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing. The patient was ultimately transferred to his cart and PACU in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis of this patient is fair.",

Glenoid labrum tear.  \n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:  \n1. Arthroscopy with removal of damaged tissue from the glenoid labrum.  \n2. Subacromial decompression (removal of bone and tissue that were pressing on the rotator cuff).  \n3. Repair of the rotator cuff in the right shoulder.  \n\nSPECIFICATIONS: The surgery was done in the inpatient operating room #1 at ABCD Hospital.  \nThe patient was given an interscalene block followed by general anesthesia and was positioned in a modified beach‑chair position.  \n\nHISTORY AND FINDINGS:  \nThe patient is a 48‑year‑old man who has had increasing pain in his right shoulder for several months. Outpatient treatments did not help. After discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives, he chose to have the surgery.  \nDuring the arthroscopy, the surgeon saw a degenerative tear of the glenoid labrum. The biceps tendon was intact. There were only mild wear changes in the shoulder joint. The rotator cuff tear was on the inner surface of the joint and was elliptical to V‑shaped. The patient also had a type III acromion (a bony projection on the shoulder blade).  \n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was laid on his back on the operating table after receiving the nerve block and general anesthesia. He was positioned safely in the beach‑chair position. The surgical area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \nThree arthroscopic portals were made: one at the back, one at the front, and one on the side.  \nA diagnostic arthroscopy was performed inside the joint. A 4.2‑mm shaver was used to remove damaged tissue from the glenoid labrum. The biceps tendon was checked and found to be intact. The undersurface of the rotator cuff was cleaned with the shaver, including the bone where the cuff attaches.  \nThe arthroscope was then moved to the space under the acromion (subacromial space) and a lateral portal was made. A bursectomy (removal of the bursa) was done in steps to clear the top of the cuff and the gutters. An anterolateral portal was created.  \nSutures were passed through the cuff using a silk suture and a #2 fiber wire. The sutures were tied with a slip‑tight knot followed by two half‑hitches, which restored the tear to its normal position.  \nA superolateral portal was made and a #1 Mitek suture anchor was placed in the posterior cuff to secure it to the bone. The anchor was inserted, the loop was pulled into the drilled holes, and the tear was again well reduced.  \nA trial range of motion was performed and was satisfactory.  \nA subacromial decompression was then performed by releasing the coracoacromial ligament with a vapor Bovie and using a 4.8‑mm motorized burr to reshape the type III acromion into a flat type I shape.  \nThroughout the procedure, the joint was irrigated with large amounts of fluid. A light bursectomy was done to remove any remaining bony fragments.  \nA pain‑control catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length. 0.5% Marcaine (local anesthetic) was injected after the portals were closed with #4‑0 nylon sutures.  \nDressings were applied with Adaptic, 4×4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape.  \nThe patient was moved to the recovery area in good condition. The expected surgical outcome for this patient is fair."
