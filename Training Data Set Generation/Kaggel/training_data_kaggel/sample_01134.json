  "medical": "CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Motor vehicle collision. CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained. FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection. The ventricles and cortical sulci are normal in shape and configuration. The gray/white matter junctions are well preserved. There is no calvarial fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: Negative for acute intracranial disease. CT CERVICAL SPINE TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained. Sagittal and coronal images were obtained. FINDINGS: Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis is compatible with patient position versus muscle spasms. No fracture or subluxation is seen. Anterior and posterior osteophyte formation is seen at C5-C6. No abnormal anterior cervical soft tissue swelling is seen. No spinal compression is noted. The atlanto-dens interval is normal. There is a large retention cyst versus polyp within the right maxillary sinus. IMPRESSION: 1. Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis compatible with patient positioning versus muscle spasms. 2. Degenerative disk and joint disease at C5-C6. 3. Retention cyst versus polyp of the right maxillary sinus.",
  "layman": "CT of the head and cervical spine were done without contrast after a car accident.\n\n**Head scan**  \n- No bleeding, swelling, or shift of brain structures.  \n- Brain ventricles and grooves look normal.  \n- The gray‑white brain border is clear.  \n- No skull fracture.  \n- Sinuses and ear air cells are clear.  \n**Conclusion:** No acute brain problems.\n\n**Cervical spine scan**  \n- The normal curve of the neck is straight, likely because of how the patient was positioned or muscle tension.  \n- No broken bones or dislocations.  \n- Small bone spurs (osteophytes) are present at the C5‑C6 level.  \n- No swelling of the soft tissues in front of the neck.  \n- No spinal cord compression.  \n- The space between the first cervical vertebra and the skull (atlanto‑dens interval) is normal.  \n- A large fluid‑filled cyst or polyp is seen in the right maxillary sinus.  \n**Conclusion:**  \n1. Straight neck curve due to positioning or muscle tension.  \n2. Degenerative changes (bone spurs) at C5‑C6.  \n3. Cyst or polyp in the right maxillary sinus."
