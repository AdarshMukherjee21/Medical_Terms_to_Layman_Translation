  "medical": "EXAM: Modified barium swallow. SYMPTOM: Dysphagia with possible aspiration. FINDINGS: A cookie deglutition study was performed. The patient was examined in the direct lateral position. Patient was challenged with thin liquids, thick liquid, semisolids and solids. Persistently demonstrable is the presence of penetration with thin liquids. This is not evident with thick liquids, semisolids or solids. There is weakness in the oral phase of deglutition. Subglottic region appears normal. There is no evidence of aspiration demonstrated. IMPRESSION: Penetration demonstrated with thin liquids with weakness of the oral phase of deglutition.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Modified barium swallow.  \nSYMPTOM: Trouble swallowing and possible inhalation of food.  \nFINDINGS: A swallow test was done. The patient was tested while lying on their side. They were asked to swallow thin liquids, thick liquids, semi‑solid foods, and solid foods. The test showed that thin liquids sometimes entered the airway (penetration). This did not happen with thick liquids, semi‑solids, or solids. The patient has weakness in the mouth part of swallowing. The area below the vocal cords looks normal. No food was seen to go into the lungs.  \nIMPRESSION: Thin liquids cause penetration into the airway, and the mouth part of swallowing is weak."
