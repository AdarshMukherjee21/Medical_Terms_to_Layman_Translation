  "medical": "CC: Headache. HX: 63 y/o RHF first seen by Neurology on 9/14/71 for complaint of episodic vertigo. During that evaluation she described a several year history of &quot;migraine&quot; headaches. She experienced her first episode of vertigo in 1969. The vertigo (clockwise) typically began suddenly after lying down, and was not associated with nausea/vomiting/headache. The vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hours to days. On 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity AD. She complained of associated tinnitus which she described as a &quot;whistle.&quot; In addition, her symptoms appeared to worsen with changes in head position (i.e. looking up or down). The symptoms gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. She was seen 9/14/71, in Neurology, and admitted for evaluation. Her neurologic exam at that time was unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. Cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm AVM in the right parietal region. The AVM was primarily fed by the right MCA. Otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from Meniere's disease. On 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for SAH secondary to right parietal AVM. On 11/23/91 she was admitted for left sided weakness (LUE &gt; LLE), headache, and transient visual change. Neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the LUE only. Brain CT confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. She underwent unsuccessful embolization. Neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left MCA, they were unable to cannulate many of the AVM vessels and abandoned the procedure. She recovered with residual left hemisensory loss. In 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and was managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention. In 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: Headache.  \nHistory: A 63‑year‑old woman first saw a neurologist on September 14, 1971 because she had episodes of vertigo. She said she had had “migraine” headaches for several years. Her first vertigo episode was in 1969. The vertigo, which moved clockwise, usually started suddenly after she lay down. It did not come with nausea, vomiting, or a headache. The vertigo was not always linked to changes in position and could last from hours to days.  \n\nOn March 15, 1971, after a five‑day period of vertigo, right‑ear pain, and trouble walking (caused by the vertigo), she went to the doctor. An audiogram showed a 20 % drop in her ability to hear low‑frequency sounds. She also had tinnitus that sounded like a whistle. Her symptoms worsened when she moved her head up or down. The vertigo and other symptoms gradually improved, and she was fine until August 1971, when she had a 19‑day episode of vertigo, tinnitus, and occasional headaches.  \n\nShe was seen again on September 14, 1971, and admitted for evaluation. Her neurological exam was normal except for loud heart‑beat sounds in both carotid arteries. A cerebral angiogram found a large, 7 × 6 cm arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right parietal part of her brain that could not be operated on. The AVM was mainly supplied by the right middle cerebral artery. An ear, nose, and throat doctor thought she also had Meniere’s disease.  \n\nOn October 14, 1974, she was hospitalized for 21 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by the right‑parietal AVM.  \n\nOn November 23, 1991, she was admitted with weakness on the left side (more in the left arm than the left leg), a headache, and brief visual changes. Neurological exam confirmed left‑side weakness and numbness only in the left arm. A brain CT scan showed a 3 × 4 cm bleed in the left parietal area. She had an attempted embolization that was not successful. The radiology team had planned three separate embolizations, but during the first one, through the left middle cerebral artery, they could not access many of the AVM vessels and stopped the procedure. She recovered but still had some loss of sensation on the left side.  \n\nIn December 1992 she had a hemorrhage between the brain’s ventricles and was treated without surgery; she declined future radiologic procedures. In January 1993 she reconsidered an interventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona."
