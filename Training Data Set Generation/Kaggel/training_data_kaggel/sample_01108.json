  "medical": "Month DD, YYYY XYZ RE: ABC MEDICAL RECORD#: 123 Dear Dr. XYZ: I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today. He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma. Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion. The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent. It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective. Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time. After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen. They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks. They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation. From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him. This is very worrisome. Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well. Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor. It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future. Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation. Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible. It is not that he does not want treatment, however. Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen. We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days. In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day. If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us. At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point. While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval. In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later. I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term. I will keep you apprised of followups. If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me. Sincerely,",

He came because he is unsure about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma. Over the past few days he has met with you and again asked whether he should have radiation for his left temporal lesion. He has been very unsure about this treatment for reasons that are not clear. His MRI shows the tumor is getting bigger, and it looks like radiation is the only therapy that could help right now. I have explained this many times, but he still worries about long‑term side effects that seem unnecessary at this point.\n\nAfter seeing you, he and his friend wanted to talk about changing his chemotherapy. They brought a list of eight drugs they would like to try in the next two weeks. They also asked for another MRI, hoping that this approach might bring another remission and avoid radiation. I noticed that his speech has gotten worse since I last saw him, and today I saw a right facial droop for the first time. This shows he is becoming symptomatic from the growing tumor. It suggests that his ability to follow treatment plans may decline soon.\n\nI again tried to convince him to get radiation, but he still could not agree. He does want treatment, but I told him it would not be ethical to start the aggressive regimen he and his friend suggested. We decided to go back to a low‑dose daily Temodar schedule: 75 mg/m² every day for 21 days out of 28. We will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day. If he tolerates this for one week, we will add one of the other drugs he listed. We are thinking of using Accutane then. I am uncomfortable with this plan, but I believe close monitoring will allow us to keep him on it for a reasonable time.\n\nIn the spirit of compromise, he agreed to be evaluated for radiation and now seems more willing to have it sooner rather than later. I view this as a positive sign because radiation is the treatment that can give him a good long‑term response. I will keep you updated on follow‑ups. If you have any questions or need more information, please contact me.\n\nSincerely,"
