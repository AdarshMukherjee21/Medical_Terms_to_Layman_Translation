  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gross hematuria. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gross hematuria. OPERATIONS: Cystopyelogram, clot evacuation, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor x2 on the dome and on the left wall of the bladder. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. FINDINGS: Significant amount of bladder clots measuring about 150 to 200 mL, two cupful of clots were removed. There was papillary tumor on the left wall right at the bladder neck and one on the right dome near the bladder neck on the right side. The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs. The patient had hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy. The patient came in again with gross hematuria. The first biopsy was done about a month ago. The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria. The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed. Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed. Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed. The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder. There was a tight bladder neck contracture. The prostate was not enlarged. Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed. It took about half an hour to just remove the clots. After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected. This was lateral to the left ureteral opening. The base was coagulated for hemostasis. Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized. The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal. Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal. The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots. The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening. A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation. The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal. At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started. The patient was brought to Recovery room in stable condition.",

Two cupfuls of clots were removed.  \n- A small, finger‑like tumor on the left wall near the bladder neck and another on the right dome near the bladder neck.  \n- The opening of the right ureter (tube from the kidney) was hard to see; the left ureter opening was normal.\n\n**Brief history:**  \nThe patient is a 78‑year‑old man who has had visible blood in his urine and repeated urinary tract infections. He had a cystoscopy (scope into the bladder) that found an abnormal biopsy. About a month ago he had a biopsy, but before it could be repeated he came to the hospital again with visible blood in his urine. The doctors discussed options: watchful waiting, removing clots, and doing more biopsies. They explained the risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, heart attack, blood clots in the legs, and lung clots. They also talked about the chances of complications and death from the procedure. The patient’s daughter‑in‑law, who has power of attorney in Florida, gave consent.\n\n**Description of the procedure:**  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and given spinal anesthesia. He was positioned on his back with legs up (dorsal lithotomy position). The area was cleaned and covered in a sterile way. He had stopped taking Coumadin (a blood thinner) about four days earlier and his blood clotting level had been reversed. When the bladder was opened, a lot of clots were seen. The bladder neck was tight. The prostate was not enlarged.\n\nUsing a 24‑French sheath and irrigation, about two cupfuls of clots were removed. This took about 30 minutes. After the clots were cleared, a 24‑French cutting loop resectoscope was used to remove the tumor on the left upper wall near the dome (about the 2 o’clock position). The base of the tumor was cauterized to stop bleeding. The same was done at the 10 o’clock position on the right side where a tumor was seen. The back wall and the rest of the bladder looked normal.\n\nAn 8‑French cone‑tip catheter was used to take a left‑side pyelogram; it was normal. The right‑side pyelogram was hard to get because the mucosa (inner lining) was irritated by the clots. Contrast dye went up to the right ureter opening, but it was hard to see the opening clearly. A little contrast leaked out, but the force was not increased to avoid causing a scar that could block the tube later. A CT scan with contrast had already shown that the kidneys were normal.\n\nAfter the procedure, a #24 three‑way irrigation tube was started. The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
