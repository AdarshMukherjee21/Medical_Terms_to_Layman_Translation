For one year prior to the diagnosis, the patient experienced staggering gait, falls and episodes of lightheadedness. She also noticed that she was slowly &quot;losing&quot; her voice, and that her handwriting was becoming smaller and smaller. Two months prior to diagnosis, she began experienced bradykinesia, but denied any tremor. She noted no improvement on Sinemet, which was started in 9/95. At the time of presentation, 2/13/96, she continued to have problems with coordination and staggering gait. She felt weak in the morning and worse as the day progressed. She denied any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, HA, change in vision, seizures or stroke like events, or problems with upper extremity coordination. MEDS: Sinemet CR 25/100 1tab TID, Lopressor 25mg qhs, Vitamin E 1tab TID, Premarin 1.25mg qd, Synthroid 0.75mg qd, Oxybutynin 2.5mg has, isocyamine 0.125mg qd. PMH: 1) Hysterectomy 1965. 2) Appendectomy 1950's. 3) Left CTR 1975 and Right CTR 1978. 4) Right oophorectomy 1949 for &quot;tumor.&quot; 5) Bladder repair 1980 for unknown reason. 6) Hypothyroidism dx 4/94. 7) HTN since 1973. FHX: Father died of MI, age 80. Mother died of MI, age73. Brother died of Brain tumor, age 9. SHX: Retired employee of Champion Automotive Co. Denies use of TOB/ETOH/Illicit drugs. EXAM: BP (supine)182/113 HR (supine)94. BP (standing)161/91 HR (standing)79. RR16 36.4C. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. No comment regarding hypophonia. CN: Pupils 5/5 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Disks flat. Remainder of CN exam unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout. NO tremor noted at rest or elicited upon movement or distraction Sensory: Unremarkable PP/VIB testing. Coord: Did not show sign of dysmetria, dyssynergia, or dysdiadochokinesia. There was mild decrement on finger tapping and clasping/unclasping hands (right worse than left). Gait: Slow gait with difficulty turning on point. Difficulty initiating gait. There was reduced BUE swing on walking (right worse than left). Station: 3-4step retropulsion. Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout BUE and patellae. 1/1 Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor. Gen Exam: Inremarkable. HEENT: unremarkable. COURSE: The patient continued Sinemet CR 25/100 1tab TID and was told to monitor orthostatic BP at home. The evaluating Neurologist became concerned that she may have Parkinsonism plus dysautonomia. She was seen again on 5/28/96 and reported no improvement in her condition. In addition she complained of worsening lightheadedness upon standing and had an episode, 1 week prior to 5/28/96, in which she was at her kitchen table and became unable to move. There were no involuntary movements or alteration in sensorium/mental status. During the episode she recalled wanting to turn, but could not. Two weeks prior to 5/28/96 she had an episode of orthostatic syncope in which she struck her head during a fall. She discontinued Sinemet 5 days prior to 5/28/96 and felt better. She felt she was moving slower and that her micrographia had worsened. She had had recent difficulty rolling over in bed and has occasional falls when turning. She denied hypophonia, dysphagia or diplopia. On EXAM: BP (supine)153/110 with HR 88. BP (standing)110/80 with HR 96. (+) Myerson's sign and mild hypomimia, but no hypophonia. There was normal blinking and EOM. Motor strength was full throughout. No resting tremor, but mild postural tremor present. No rigidity noted. Mild decrement on finger tapping noted. Reflexes were symmetric. No Babinski signs and no clonus. Gait was short stepped with mild anteroflexed posture. She was unable to turn on point. 3-4 step Retropulsion noted. The Parkinsonism had been unresponsive to Sinemet and she had autonomic dysfunction suggestive of Shy-Drager syndrome. It was recommended that she liberalize dietary salt use and lie with head of the bed elevate at 20-30 degrees at night. Indomethacin was suggested to improve BP in future.",
  "layman": "**Chief Complaint:** Falling.\n\n**History:**  \nA 67‑year‑old woman was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease on September 1, 1995 by a local doctor. For the year before that she had an unsteady, staggering walk, fell often, and felt light‑headed. She also noticed her voice was getting softer and her handwriting was shrinking. Two months before the diagnosis she began to move slowly (bradykinesia) but did not have tremor. She started Sinemet in September 1995 but it did not help. On February 13, 1996 she still had coordination problems and a staggering gait. She felt weak in the morning and worse later in the day. She denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, vision changes, seizures, stroke‑like events, or arm coordination problems.\n\n**Medications:**  \n- Sinemet CR 25/100, 1 tablet three times a day  \n- Lopressor 25 mg at bedtime  \n- Vitamin E 1 tablet three times a day  \n- Premarin 1.25 mg daily  \n- Synthroid 0.75 mg daily  \n- Oxybutynin 2.5 mg as needed  \n- Isocyamine 0.125 mg daily  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n1) Hysterectomy 1965.  \n2) Appendectomy 1950s.  \n3) Left coronary artery bypass 1975 and right 1978.  \n4) Right oophorectomy 1949 for a tumor.  \n5) Bladder repair 1980 for an unknown reason.  \n6) Hypothyroidism diagnosed April 1994.  \n7) Hypertension since 1973.  \n\n**Family History:**  \nFather died of a heart attack at 80. Mother died of a heart attack at 73. Brother died of a brain tumor at 9.\n\n**Social History:**  \nRetired employee of Champion Automotive Co. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- Blood pressure lying down 182/113, heart rate 94.  \n- Blood pressure standing 161/91, heart rate 79.  \n- Respiratory rate 16, temperature 36.4 °C.  \n- Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  \n- Speech fluent and normal; no difficulty speaking.  \n- Eyes: pupils equal 5 mm, constrict to 2 mm with light. Rest of cranial nerve exam normal.  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 in all limbs. No tremor at rest or when moving.  \n- Sensation normal.  \n- Coordination: no mis‑aimed movements, lack of coordination, or difficulty with rapid alternating movements. Mild slowing of finger tapping and hand clasping, worse on the right.  \n- Gait: slow, trouble turning on one foot, difficulty starting to walk, reduced arm swing, especially on the right. She could be pushed back 3–4 steps.  \n- Reflexes 2/2 in all arms and knees, 1/1 in ankles. Plantar reflexes flexor.  \n- Genital exam normal. Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat normal.\n\n**Course:**  \nShe kept taking Sinemet CR 25/100 three times a day and was told to check her standing blood pressure at home. The neurologist suspected Parkinsonism plus autonomic dysfunction. She was seen again on May 28, 1996 and reported no improvement. She said her light‑headedness when standing had worsened and she had an episode a week before that date where she was at her kitchen table, could not move, and had no involuntary movements or confusion. She remembered wanting to turn but could not. Two weeks before May 28 she had a fainting episode while standing, fell and hit her head. She stopped Sinemet five days before May 28 and felt better. She felt she was moving slower and her small handwriting had gotten worse. She had trouble rolling over in bed and sometimes fell when turning. She denied soft voice, trouble swallowing, or double vision.  \n\nExamination on May 28:  \n- Blood pressure lying 153/110, heart rate 88; standing 110/80, heart rate 96.  \n- Positive Myerson’s sign and mild facial masking, but no soft voice. Normal blinking and eye movements.  \n- Muscle strength full. No resting tremor, but mild tremor when holding a posture. No stiffness. Mild slowing of finger tapping. Reflexes symmetrical. No abnormal reflexes.  \n- Gait short‑stepped with a slightly forward‑leaning posture. She could not turn on one foot. She could be pushed back 3–4 steps.  \n\nThe Parkinsonism did not respond to Sinemet and she had autonomic problems suggestive of Shy‑Drager syndrome. She was advised to increase salt in her diet, raise the head of her bed 20–30 degrees at night, and was told that indomethacin might help her blood pressure in the future."
