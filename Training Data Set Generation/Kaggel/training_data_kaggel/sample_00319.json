  "medical": "EXAM: Lexiscan Nuclear Myocardial Perfusion Scan. INDICATION: Chest pain. TYPE OF TEST: Lexiscan, unable to walk on a treadmill. INTERPRETATION: Resting heart rate of 96, blood pressure of 141/76. EKG, normal sinus rhythm, nonspecific ST-T changes, left bundle branch block. Post Lexiscan 0.4 mg injected intravenously by standard protocol. Peak heart rate was 105, blood pressure of 135/72. EKG remains the same. No symptoms are noted. SUMMARY: 1. Nondiagnostic Lexiscan. 2. Nuclear interpretation as below. NUCLEAR MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION SCAN WITH STANDARD PROTOCOL: Resting and stress images were obtained with 10.4, 32.5 mCi of tetrofosmin injected intravenously by standard protocol. Myocardial perfusion scan demonstrates homogeneous and uniform distribution of the tracer uptake. There is no evidence of reversible or fixed defect. Gated SPECT revealed mild global hypokinesis, more pronounced in the septal wall possibly secondary to prior surgery. Ejection fraction calculated at 41%. End-diastolic volume of 115, end-systolic volume of 68. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal nuclear myocardial perfusion scan. 2. Ejection fraction 41% by gated SPECT.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** Lexiscan nuclear heart scan.  \n**Reason for test:** Chest pain.  \n**How the test was done:** Because I couldn’t walk on a treadmill, we used Lexiscan instead.  \n\n**What we saw:**  \n- At rest my heart beat 96 times a minute and my blood pressure was 141/76.  \n- The EKG showed a normal rhythm but had some non‑specific changes and a left bundle branch block.  \n- After giving 0.4 mg of Lexiscan through a vein, my peak heart rate was 105 and blood pressure was 135/72. The EKG stayed the same and I had no symptoms.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n1. The Lexiscan part of the test didn’t give clear results.  \n2. The nuclear scan results are described below.  \n\n**Nuclear heart scan (standard protocol):**  \n- We took images while resting and while stressed, injecting 10.4 mCi and then 32.5 mCi of a radioactive tracer called tetrofosmin.  \n- The tracer spread evenly throughout the heart muscle.  \n- There were no areas that looked damaged or had poor blood flow.  \n- A gated SPECT scan showed the heart was moving a little less than normal, especially in the septal wall, probably because of a previous surgery.  \n- The ejection fraction (the percentage of blood pumped out with each beat) was 41%.  \n- The heart’s end‑diastolic volume (size when full) was 115 mL and the end‑systolic volume (size after pumping) was 68 mL.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. The nuclear heart scan is normal.  \n2. The ejection fraction is 41% as measured by gated SPECT."
