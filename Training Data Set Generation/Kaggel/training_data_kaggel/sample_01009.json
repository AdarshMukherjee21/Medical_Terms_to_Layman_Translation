  "medical": "CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST, CT FACIAL BONES WITHOUT CONTRAST, AND CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Motor vehicle collision. CT HEAD TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained without contrast. FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection. The ventricles and cortical sulci are normal in shape and configuration. The gray/white matter junctions are well preserved. No calvarial fracture is seen. IMPRESSION: Negative for acute intracranial disease. CT FACIAL BONES WITHOUT CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the facial bones were obtained with coronal reconstructions. FINDINGS: There is no facial bone fracture. The maxilla and mandible are intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The temporomandibular joints are intact. The nasal bone is intact. The orbits are intact. The extra-ocular muscles and orbital nerves are normal. The orbital globes are normal. IMPRESSION: No evidence for a facial bone fracture. CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained with sagittal and coronal reconstructions. FINDINGS: There is a normal lordosis of the cervical spine, no fracture or subluxation is seen. The vertebral body heights are normal. The intervertebral disk spaces are well preserved. The atlanto-dens interval is normal. No abnormal anterior cervical soft tissue swelling is seen. There is no spinal compression deformity. IMPRESSION: Negative for a facial bone fracture.",
  "layman": "CT scan of the head, facial bones, and neck (no contrast) was done after a car accident.\n\n**Head scan**  \nTechnique: Images taken without contrast.  \nFindings: No bleeding, swelling, or shift inside the skull. The brain’s shape and the spaces around it look normal. The brain tissue looks healthy. No skull fracture.  \nImpression: No new brain problems.\n\n**Facial bones scan**  \nTechnique: Images taken without contrast, with side‑view reconstructions.  \nFindings: No broken facial bones. Upper and lower jaws are fine. Sinuses are clear. Jaw joints, nose bone, and eye sockets are normal. Eye muscles and nerves are normal.  \nImpression: No broken facial bones.\n\n**Neck scan**  \nTechnique: Images taken without contrast, with side and front‑view reconstructions.  \nFindings: Normal neck curve. No broken or misaligned vertebrae. The vertebrae and discs look normal. The space between the top vertebrae is normal. No swelling in the front neck tissues. No spinal compression.  \nImpression: No neck bone problems."
