  "medical": "REPORT: The electroencephalogram shows background activity at about 9-10 cycle/second bilaterally. Little activity in the beta range is noted. Waves of 4-7 cycle/second of low amplitude were occasionally noted. Abundant movements and technical artifacts are noted throughout this tracing. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation reveals no important changes. CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: The electroencephalogram is essentially normal.",
  "layman": "REPORT: The EEG shows normal background activity at about 9‑10 cycles per second on both sides. There is little beta activity. Occasionally, low‑amplitude waves at 4‑7 cycles per second appear. The recording has many movements and technical glitches. We did not do hyperventilation. Light stimulation did not change anything. CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: The EEG is basically normal."
