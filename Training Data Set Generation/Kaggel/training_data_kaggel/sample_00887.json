  "medical": "INDICATIONS: Peripheral vascular disease with claudication. RIGHT: 1. Normal arterial imaging of right lower extremity. 2. Peak systolic velocity is normal. 3. Arterial waveform is triphasic. 4. Ankle brachial index is 0.96. LEFT: 1. Normal arterial imaging of left lower extremity. 2. Peak systolic velocity is normal. 3. Arterial waveform is triphasic throughout except in posterior tibial artery where it is biphasic. 4. Ankle brachial index is 1.06. IMPRESSION: Normal arterial imaging of both lower extremities.",
  "layman": "**Indications:**  \nThe patient has peripheral vascular disease that causes pain when walking (claudication).\n\n**Right leg:**  \n1. The artery images look normal.  \n2. The speed of blood flow at the peak of each heartbeat is normal.  \n3. The blood flow pattern has three distinct phases (triphasic).  \n4. The ankle‑brachial index (a measure of blood flow to the ankle) is 0.96.\n\n**Left leg:**  \n1. The artery images look normal.  \n2. The peak blood‑flow speed is normal.  \n3. The blood‑flow pattern is triphasic everywhere except in the posterior tibial artery, where it is biphasic (two phases).  \n4. The ankle‑brachial index is 1.06.\n\n**Impression:**  \nBoth lower legs have normal arterial imaging."
