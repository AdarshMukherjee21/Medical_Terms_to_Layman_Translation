  "medical": "EXAM:MRI CERVICAL SPINE CLINICAL: A57-year-old male. Received for outside consultation is an MRI examination performed on 11/28/2005. FINDINGS: Normal brainstem-cervical cord junction. Normal cisterna magna with no tonsillar ectopia. Normal clivus with a normal craniovertebral junction. Normal anterior atlantoaxial articulation. C2-3: Normal intervertebral disc with no spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina with no cord or radicular impingement. C3-4: There is disc desiccation with minimal annular bulging. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 10mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. C4-5: There is disc desiccation with endplate spondylosis and mild uncovertebral joint arthrosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 8mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft producing a borderline central canal stenosis but no cord distortion or cord edema. There is minimal uncovertebral joint arthrosis. C5-6: There is disc desiccation with minimal posterior annular bulging and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion measuring approximately 2 x 8mm (AP x transverse). The disc protrusion produces minimal rightward ventral thecal sac flattening but no cord impingement. C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild loss of disc space height and posterior endplate spondylosis and annular bulging producing central canal stenosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 8 mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. There is a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex encroaching upon the left intervertebral neural foramen with probable radicular impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root. C7-T1, T1-2: Minimal disc desiccation with no disc displacement or endplate spondylosis. IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative disc disease as described above. C4-5 borderline central canal stenosis with mild bilateral foraminal compromise. C5-6 disc desiccation with a borderline central canal stenosis and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion producing thecal sac distortion. C6-7 degenerative disc disease and endplate spondylosis with a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex producing probable neural impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root with a borderline central canal stenosis. Normal cervical cord.",
  "layman": "**MRI of the cervical spine**\n\n**Patient:** 57‑year‑old man.  \n**Date of study:** 11/28/2005.  \n\n**Findings**\n\n- The brainstem and the start of the spinal cord look normal.  \n- The space behind the brain (cisterna magna) is normal and the tonsils are in the right place.  \n- The skull base (clivus) and the junction where the skull meets the spine are normal.  \n- The joint between the first two cervical vertebrae (C1‑C2) is normal.  \n\n**Cervical vertebrae**\n\n- **C2‑C3:** The disc is normal, with no bone changes or joint arthritis. The spinal canal and the openings for nerves are clear, with no pressure on the cord or nerves.  \n- **C3‑C4:** The disc is slightly dry and has a small bulge. The spinal canal is about 10 mm wide; fluid around the cord is still visible.  \n- **C4‑C5:** The disc is dry, the bone edges show mild wear, and the joint has a little arthritis. The canal is about 8 mm wide, with a borderline narrowing but no cord swelling.  \n- **C5‑C6:** The disc is dry with a small bulge behind it and a small disc protrusion on the right side (about 2 mm front‑to‑back by 8 mm wide). This pushes the outer layer of the spinal cord slightly to the right but does not press on the cord.  \n- **C6‑C7:** The disc is dry, the space between the vertebrae is a little lower, and the bone edges show wear and a bulge that narrows the canal. The canal is 8 mm wide and the fluid space is reduced. A bony growth on the left side presses into the left nerve opening, likely affecting the left C7 nerve root.  \n- **C7‑T1 and T1‑T2:** The discs are slightly dry but show no displacement or bone wear.  \n\n**Impression**\n\n- Degenerative changes in several discs (multilevel).  \n- Mild narrowing of the spinal canal at C4‑C5 with slight narrowing of the nerve openings on both sides.  \n- At C5‑C6, disc wear and a small bulge on the right side cause slight distortion of the outer spinal cord layer.  \n- At C6‑C7, disc wear, bone wear, and a bony growth on the left side likely press on the left C7 nerve root, with borderline narrowing of the spinal canal.  \n- The cervical spinal cord itself is normal."
