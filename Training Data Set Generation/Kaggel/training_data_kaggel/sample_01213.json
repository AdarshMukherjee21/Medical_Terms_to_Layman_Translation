  "medical": "EXAM: Cervical, lumbosacral, thoracic spine flexion and extension. HISTORY: Back and neck pain. CERVICAL SPINE FINDINGS: AP, lateral with flexion and extension, and both oblique projections of the cervical spine demonstrate alignment and soft tissue structures to be unremarkable. The vertebral bodies and the disc spaces appear normal. Oblique views demonstrate the intervertebral foramina to be of normal size and appearance. The odontoid view demonstrates the C1-2 structures to be in anatomical alignment. Additional flexion and extension views in the lateral position demonstrate normal physiologic movement with no evidence of subluxation or fixation. IMPRESSION: Negative cervical spine study including flexion-extension views. THORACIC SPINE FINDINGS: AP and lateral views of the thoracic spine, including a &quot;swimmer's&quot; projection for the upper thoracic spine, demonstrate satisfactory bony alignment. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc spaces. No fractures or loss of normal bony architecture is seen. No paravertebral masses are identified. IMPRESSION: Negative thoracic spine. LUMBAR SPINE FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the lumbar spine demonstrate satisfactory bony alignment with no fractures or loss of normal bony architecture. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc spaces. No paravertebral masses are evident. There is no fracture. IMPRESSION: Negative.",
  "layman": "EXAM: X‑rays of the neck, upper back, and lower back while bending forward and backward.  \nHISTORY: Pain in the back and neck.  \n\nCERVICAL (NECK) FINDINGS:  \n- Front, side, and angled X‑rays show the neck bones and soft tissues look normal.  \n- The vertebrae and the spaces between them look normal.  \n- Angled views show the openings where nerves exit are normal.  \n- The view of the top two neck bones (C1‑C2) shows they are properly aligned.  \n- Extra side‑view X‑rays while bending show normal movement with no slipping or stuck joints.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Neck X‑rays are normal, including the bending views.  \n\nTHORACIC (UPPER BACK) FINDINGS:  \n- Front, side, and a special “swimmer’s” view of the upper back show the bones line up well.  \n- The heights of the vertebrae and the spaces between them are preserved.  \n- No fractures or abnormal bone changes are seen.  \n- No abnormal masses near the spine.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Upper back X‑rays are normal.  \n\nLUMBAR (LOWER BACK) FINDINGS:  \n- Front and side views show the lower back bones line up well.  \n- No fractures or abnormal bone changes.  \n- The heights of the vertebrae and the spaces between them are preserved.  \n- No abnormal masses near the spine.  \n\nIMPRESSION: Lower back X‑rays are normal."
