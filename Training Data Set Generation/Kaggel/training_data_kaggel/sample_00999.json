TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiogram. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine upon the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion. Marcaine was injected through the umbilicus. A small incision was made in the umbilicus, and a Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg, and a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed into the umbilicus. I then placed a 5-mm port in the midline just subxiphoid, another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal, and another 5-mm port in the mid-axillary line just subcostal. I grasped the fundus of the gallbladder and pulled it superiorly over the liver. The gallbladder was inflamed and did appear to have acute cholecystitis. There were some adhesions from the omentum, which were taken down. I grabbed the infundibulum of the gallbladder and pulled it inferolaterally, and thereby splayed out the cystic duct. The cystic duct was bluntly dissected. I put a clip distally against the gallbladder. I then cut a small hole in the cystic duct. I passed an Arrow catheter into the cystic duct and inflated the balloon. I injected dye under fluoroscopy, and I could feel the hepatic duct and the common bile duct. There were no stones in the common bile duct. The dye easily passed into the intestine. I then removed the Arrow catheter. I placed 2 clips proximally on the cystic duct, and I put an extra stitch through the duct at the very end with a Vicryl stitch to be sure that it was secured. I put 2 clips on the cystic artery, and 1 distally, and it was divided. I then took the gallbladder off the hepatic fossa using electrocautery. I placed it in an Endocatch bag and removed it through the umbilicus. I copiously irrigated out the abdomen. I then closed the fascia of the umbilicus with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture. I closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.",

She was put under general anesthesia and a breathing tube was inserted. The belly was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. A local anesthetic (Marcaine) was injected around the belly button. A small cut was made at the belly button and a needle was used to create a small space inside the abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas was pumped in to lift the belly wall, and a 12‑mm surgical port was placed at the belly button. Three additional 5‑mm ports were inserted: one just below the sternum, one just below the ribs on the mid‑clavicle line, and one just below the ribs on the mid‑axillary line.\n\nThe surgeon lifted the top of the gallbladder up over the liver. The gallbladder was swollen and looked like it had acute inflammation. Some scar tissue from the omentum was cut away. The surgeon pulled the lower part of the gallbladder down and to the side to spread out the cystic duct. The cystic duct was carefully cut. A clip was placed on the end of the gallbladder side of the duct. A small hole was made in the duct, and a catheter with a balloon (Arrow catheter) was inserted and inflated. Dye was injected while the surgeon watched with a fluoroscope. The dye showed the hepatic duct and the common bile duct, and no stones were seen in the common bile duct. The dye flowed easily into the intestine. The catheter was removed. Two more clips were placed on the cystic duct, and an extra stitch was added at the very end to make sure it was secure. Two clips were placed on the cystic artery, one more clip was placed further down, and the artery was cut.\n\nThe gallbladder was then detached from the liver using electrocautery. It was placed in a retrieval bag and taken out through the belly‑button incision. The abdomen was washed thoroughly. The belly‑button incision was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl stitches. All other incisions were closed with running Monocryl stitches. All sponges, instruments, and needles were counted and accounted for. The patient tolerated the surgery well and had no complications."
