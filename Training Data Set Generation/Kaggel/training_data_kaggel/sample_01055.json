FHX: Not noted. SHX: Cigar smoker. Truck driver. EXAM: BP 193/73. HR 71. RR 21. Temp 37.2C. MS: A&O to person, place and time. No note regarding speech or thought process. CN: Subhyaloid hemorrhages, OU. Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Face symmetric. Tongue midline. Gag response difficult to elicit. Corneal responses not noted. MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout. Sensory: Intact PP/VIB. Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout. Plantars were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: The patient underwent Cerebral Angiography on 10/13/92. This revealed a lobulated aneurysm off the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery close to the origin of the posterior communication artery. The patient subsequently underwent clipping of this aneurysm. He recovery was complicated severe vasospasm and bacterial meningitis. HCT on 10/19/92 revealed multiple low density areas in the left hemisphere in the LACA-LPCA watershed, left fronto-parietal area and left thalamic region. He was left with residual right hemiparesis, urinary incontinence, some (unspecified) degree of mental dysfunction. He was last seen 2/26/93 in Neurosurgery clinic and had stable deficits.",

Since then, his wife reports he has had repeated headaches and his consciousness has been fluctuating. He went to the local hospital on the morning of October 13, 1992. A head CT scan there showed bleeding in the space around the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage). He was then transferred to UIHC. He was not on any medications.\n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. He had fractures of the right hip and clavicle many years ago.  \n2. All of his teeth have been removed.\n\n**Family history:** Not mentioned.  \n**Social history:** He smokes cigars and works as a truck driver.\n\n**Physical exam (at UIHC):**  \n- Blood pressure 193/73 mm Hg, heart rate 71 bpm, breathing 21 breaths/min, temperature 37.2 °C.  \n- He was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Speech and thought were not noted.  \n- Eye exam: small blood spots under the lens in both eyes; pupils were 4 mm and became 2 mm when light was shone. Face was symmetrical; tongue was in the middle. Gag reflex was hard to get. Corneal reflexes were not recorded.  \n- Muscle strength 5/5 in all limbs.  \n- Sensation to pain and vibration was normal.  \n- Reflexes 2+ in all limbs. Plantar reflexes flexed.  \n- Genital exam was normal.\n\n**Course:**  \nOn October 13, 1992, he had a cerebral angiogram that found a lobulated aneurysm on the left internal carotid artery near the start of the posterior communicating artery. He had the aneurysm clipped. His recovery was complicated by severe narrowing of blood vessels (vasospasm) and bacterial meningitis. A head CT on October 19, 1992 showed several low‑density spots in the left hemisphere (in the watershed area between the left anterior and left posterior cerebral arteries, the left front‑parietal region, and the left thalamus). He was left with weakness on the right side of his body, urinary incontinence, and some level of mental impairment. He was last seen in the neurosurgery clinic on February 26, 1993 and his deficits were stable."
