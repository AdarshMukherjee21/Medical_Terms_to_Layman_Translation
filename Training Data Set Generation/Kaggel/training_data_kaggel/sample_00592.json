  "medical": "PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer screening. POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Colon polyps, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy, conscious sedation, and snare polypectomy. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 63-year-old male who has myelodysplastic syndrome, who was referred for colonoscopy. He has had previous colonoscopy. There is no family history of bleeding, no current problems with his bowels. On examination, he has internal hemorrhoids. His prostate is enlarged and increased somewhat in firmness. He has scattered diverticular disease of a moderate degree and he has two polyps, one 1 cm in the mid ascending colon, and one in the left transverse colon, which is also 1 cm. These were removed with snare polypectomy technique. I would recommend that the patient have an increased fiber diet and repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or sooner if he develops bowel habit change or bleeding. PROCEDURE: After explaining the operative procedure, the risks and potential complications of bleeding and perforation, the patient was given 175 mcg fentanyl, and 8 mg Versed intravenously for conscious sedation. Blood pressure 115/60, pulse 98, respiration 18, and saturation 92%. A rectal examination was done and then the colonoscope was inserted through the anorectum, rectosigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon, to the ileocecal valve. The scope was withdrawn to the mid ascending colon, where the polyp was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, then retrieved through the suction port. The scope was withdrawn into the left transverse colon, where the second polyp was identified. It was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, and then removed through the suction port as well. The scope was then gradually withdrawn the remaining distance and removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.",

He has had a previous colonoscopy. There is no family history of bleeding and he has no current bowel problems. On exam he has internal hemorrhoids. His prostate is enlarged and a bit firm. He has moderate diverticular disease and two 1‑cm polyps—one in the middle of the ascending colon and one in the left transverse colon. Both polyps were removed with a snare. The doctor advised him to eat more fiber and to have another colonoscopy in 5 years, or sooner if he notices changes in bowel habits or bleeding.  \n\nPROCEDURE: After explaining the procedure, its risks, and possible complications such as bleeding or perforation, the patient received 175 mcg fentanyl and 8 mg Versed IV for conscious sedation. Vital signs were: blood pressure 115/60, pulse 98, breathing 18, oxygen saturation 92%. A rectal exam was done, then the colonoscope was inserted through the anus, rectum, sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon up to the ileocecal valve. The scope was pulled back to the mid‑ascending colon where the first polyp was snared and removed using a mix of cutting and coagulating current, then taken out through the suction port. The scope was then pulled to the left transverse colon where the second polyp was found, snared, and removed in the same way. The scope was then withdrawn the rest of the way and removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
