  "medical": "DIAGNOSIS: Possible cerebrovascular accident. DESCRIPTION: The EEG was obtained using 21 electrodes placed in scalp-to-scalp and scalp-to-vertex montages. The background activity appears to consist of fairly organized somewhat pleomorphic low to occasional medium amplitude of 7-8 cycle per second activity and was seen mostly posteriorly bilaterally symmetrically. A large amount of movement artifacts and electromyographic effects were noted intermixed throughout the recording session. Transient periods of drowsiness occurred naturally producing irregular 5-7 cycle per second activity mostly over the anterior regions. Hyperventilation was not performed. No epileptiform activity or any definite lateralizing findings were seen. IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal study. The findings are suggestive of a generalized cerebral disorder. Due to the abundant amount of movement artifacts, any lateralizing findings, if any cannot be well appreciated. Clinical correlation is recommended.",
  "layman": "DIAGNOSIS: Possible stroke.  \nDESCRIPTION: An EEG test was done using 21 electrodes on the scalp. The brain activity looked fairly organized, with waves that were mostly low to medium in size and ran at about 7‑8 cycles per second. This activity was mainly seen on both sides of the back of the head. There were a lot of movement and muscle noise throughout the test. When the person naturally fell a bit drowsy, the waves slowed to about 5‑7 cycles per second, mainly in the front of the head. The test did not include a breathing exercise. No seizure‑type waves or clear signs pointing to one side of the brain were found.  \nIMPRESSION: The test was slightly abnormal. The results suggest a general brain problem. Because of the many movement noises, it is hard to see if any findings point to one side of the brain. A doctor should look at the results together with the patient’s symptoms."
