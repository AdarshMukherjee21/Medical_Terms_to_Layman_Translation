  "medical": "Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained. The risks that were explained were bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing small polyps within the colon. Conscious sedation was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position. A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the cecum, which was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. This was done without difficulty and the bowel preparation was good. The ileocecal valve was intubated and the distal 2 to 3 cm of terminal ileum was inspected and was normal. The colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the mucosa was performed. COMPLICATIONS: None.",
  "layman": "The patient gave permission after we explained the risks and benefits. We told them about possible bleeding, infection, a hole in the colon, allergic reactions to the medicine, and that we might miss very small growths in the colon. The patient was sedated and lay on their left side. We inserted a colonoscope through the rectum all the way to the cecum, which we found by seeing the opening of the appendix and the ileocecal valve. This was easy and the bowel prep was good. We looked at the ileocecal valve and the last 2–3 cm of the terminal ileum and everything looked normal. Then we pulled the scope back out slowly, checking the lining of the colon carefully. No complications occurred."
