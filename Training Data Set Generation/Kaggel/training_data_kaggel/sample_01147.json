  "medical": "EXAM: Ultrasound of pelvis. HISTORY: Menorrhagia. FINDINGS: Uterus is enlarged measuring 11.0 x 7.5 x 11.0 cm. It appears to be completely replaced by multiple ill-defined fibroids. The endometrial echo complex was not visualized due to the contents of replacement of the uterus with fibroids. The right ovary measures 3.9 x 1.9 x 2.3 cm. The left ovary is not seen. No complex cystic adnexal masses are identified. IMPRESSION: Essential replacement of the uterus by fibroids. It is difficult to measure given their heterogenous and diffuse nature. MRI of the pelvis could be performed for further evaluation to evaluate for possible uterine fibroid embolization.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Pelvic ultrasound.  \nHISTORY: Heavy menstrual bleeding.  \nFINDINGS: The uterus is enlarged, about 11 × 7.5 × 11 cm. It looks like it is almost entirely made up of many fibroids that are not clearly defined. Because of the fibroids, we could not see the normal lining of the uterus. The right ovary is 3.9 × 1.9 × 2.3 cm. The left ovary was not seen. No abnormal cysts or masses were found near the ovaries.  \nIMPRESSION: The uterus is largely replaced by fibroids. Their mixed and spread-out appearance makes exact measurement hard. A pelvic MRI could be done to look more closely and to see if uterine fibroid embolization might be an option."
