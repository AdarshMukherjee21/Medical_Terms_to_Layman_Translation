TITLE OF OPERATION: Anterior cervical discectomy C4-C5 arthrodesis with 8 mm lordotic ACF spacer, corticocancellous, and stabilization with Synthes Vector plate and screws. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After identification, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. Following the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery. A shoulder roll was placed between the scapula and the head was rested on a doughnut in a slightly extended position. A preoperative x-ray was obtained to identify the operative level and neck position. An incision was marked at the C4-C5 level on the right side. The incision was opened with #10 blade knife. Dissection was carried down through subcutaneous tissues using Bovie electrocautery. The platysma muscle was divided with the cautery and mobilized rostrally and caudally. The anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected rostrally and caudally with sharp and blunt dissection. The avascular plane was then entered and dissection was carried bluntly down to the anterior cervical fascia. This was opened with scissors and dissected rostrally and caudally with the peanut dissectors. The operative level was confirmed with an intraoperative x-ray. The longus colli muscles were mobilized bilaterally using bipolar electrocautery and periosteal elevator. The anterior longitudinal ligament was then taken down with the insulated Bovie electrocautery tip exposing the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5. Self-retaining retractor was placed in submuscular position, and distraction pins were placed in the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5, and distraction was instituted. We then incise the annulus of C4-C5 and a discectomy was now carried out using pituitary rongeurs and straight and angled curettes. Operating microscope was draped and brought into play. Dissection was carried down through the disc space to the posterior aspect of the disc space removing the disc with the angled curette as we went. We now use the diamond bit to thin the posterior bone spurs and osteophytes at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally. Bone was then removed with 2 mm Kerrison punch and then we were able to traverse the posterior longitudinal ligament and this ligament was now removed in a piecemeal fashion with a 2 mm Kerrison punch. There was a transligamentous disc herniation, which was removed during this process. We then carried out bilateral foraminotomies with removal of the uncovertebral osteophytes until the foramina were widely patent. Cord was seen to be pulsating freely behind the dura. There appeared to be no complications and the decompression appeared adequate. We now used a cutting bit to prepare the inner space for arthrodesis fashioning a posterior ledge on the posterior aspect of the C5 vertebral body. An 8 mm lordotic trial was used and appeared perfect. We then used a corticocancellous 8 mm lordotic graft. This was tapped into position. Distraction was released, appeared to be in excellent position. We then positioned an 18 mm Vector plate over the inner space. Intraoperative x-ray was obtained with the stay screw in place; plates appeared to be in excellent position. We then use a 14 mm self-tapping variable angle screws in each of the four locations drilling 14 mm pilot holes at each location prior to screw insertion. All of the screws locked to the plate and this was confirmed on visual inspection. Intraoperative x-ray was again obtained. Construct appeared satisfactory. Attention was then directed to closure. The wound was copiously irrigated. All of the self-retaining retractors were removed. Bleeding points were controlled with bone wax and bipolar electrocautery. The platysma layer was now closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with running 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. A sterile bandage was applied. All sponge, needle, and cottonoid counts were reported as correct. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He was subsequently extubated in the operating room and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.",

A pillow was placed under the shoulder and the head rested on a donut‑shaped support so the neck was slightly extended. A pre‑op X‑ray was taken to confirm the level and neck position.  \n\nA small cut was made on the right side of the neck at the C4‑C5 level. The skin and fat were cut with a knife and then a cautery device. The platysma muscle was split and moved up and down. The front edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was then cut and moved up and down with sharp and blunt tools. The tissue was then opened to reach the front layer of the neck. This layer was cut with scissors and moved up and down with small forceps. An X‑ray during surgery confirmed the correct level.  \n\nThe longus colli muscles on both sides were moved aside with cautery and a small tool. The front ligament over the spine was cut with cautery, exposing the C4 and C5 vertebrae. A self‑retaining retractor was placed under the muscles, and pins were put into the C4 and C5 bones to pull them apart slightly.  \n\nThe disc between C4 and C5 was cut open and removed with small forceps and curettes. A microscope was used to see the area clearly. The disc was removed from the back side of the disc space. The surgeon then used a diamond drill to thin the bone spurs and osteophytes on both sides of the uncovertebral joints. Small bone punches removed the remaining bone, and the posterior longitudinal ligament was cut away piece by piece. A disc that had pushed through the ligament was removed.  \n\nBoth nerve root openings (foramina) were widened by removing the uncovertebral bone spurs until they were wide enough. The spinal cord was seen moving freely behind the dura. The decompression looked good.  \n\nA cutting tool was used to shape the inside of the C5 vertebra to prepare for the fusion. An 8 mm curved spacer was tried in place and fit well. A bone graft of the same size was then put in. The distraction pins were released, and the graft stayed in good position.  \n\nAn 18 mm metal plate was placed over the graft. An X‑ray confirmed the plate was in the right spot. Four self‑tapping screws (14 mm long) were drilled and inserted into the plate and bone, locking the plate in place. A final X‑ray showed the construct was satisfactory.  \n\nThe wound was washed thoroughly. All retractors were removed. Any bleeding spots were sealed with bone wax and cautery. The platysma muscle was stitched closed with 3‑0 Vicryl stitches. The skin was closed with a running 3‑0 Vicryl stitch under the skin, and Steri‑Strips were applied. A sterile bandage was put on. All sponges, needles, and cotton swabs were counted correctly.  \n\nThe patient tolerated the surgery well, was taken off the breathing tube in the operating room, and moved to the recovery area in good condition."
