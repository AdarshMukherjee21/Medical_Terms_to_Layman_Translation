  "medical": "REASON FOR CONSULT: I was asked to see the patient for C. diff colitis. HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Briefly, the patient is a very pleasant 72-year-old female with previous history of hypertension and also recent diagnosis of C. diff for which she was admitted here in 5/2009, who presents to the hospital on 6/18/2009 with abdominal pain, cramping, and persistent diarrhea. After admission, she had a CT of the abdomen done, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis and she was started on IV Flagyl and also on IV Levaquin. She was also placed on IV Reglan because of nausea and vomiting. In spite of the above, her white count still continues to be elevated today. On questioning the patient, she states the nausea and vomiting has resolved, but the diarrhea still present, but otherwise denies any other specific complaints except for some weakness. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent C. diff colitis, which had resolved based on speaking to Dr. X. Two weeks ago, he had seen the patient and she was clinically well. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: No history of smoking, alcohol, or drug use. She lives at home. HOME MEDICATIONS: She is on atenolol and Mevacor. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for diarrhea and abdominal pain, otherwise main other complaints are weakness. She denies any cough, sputum production, or dysuria at this time. Otherwise, a 10-system review is essentially negative. PHYSICAL EXAM: GENERAL: She is awake and alert, currently in no apparent distress. VITAL SIGNS: She has been afebrile since admission, temperature today 96.5, heart rate 80, respirations 18, blood pressure 125/60, and O2 sat is 98% on 2 L. HEENT: Pupils are round and reactive to light and accommodation. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2 are present. No rales appreciated. ABDOMEN: She does have tenderness to palpation all over with some mild rebound tenderness also. No guarding noted. Bowel sounds present. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. CT of the abdomen and pelvis is also reviewed on the computer, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis. LABORATORY: White blood cell count today 21.5, hemoglobin 12.4, platelet count 284,000, and neutrophils 89. UA on 6/18/2009 showed no evidence of UTI. Sodium today 130, potassium 2.7, and creatinine 0.4. AST and ALT on 6/20/2009 were normal. Blood cultures from admission were negative. Urine culture on admission was negative. C. diff was positive. Stool culture was negative. ASSESSMENT: 1. A 72-year-old female with Clostridium difficile colitis. 2. Diarrhea secondary to above and also could be related Reglan, which was discontinued today. 3. Leukocytosis secondary to above, mild improvement today though. 4. Bilateral pleural effusion by CT of the chest, although could represent thickening. 5. New requirement for oxygen, rule out pneumonia. 6. Hypertension. PLAN: 1. Treat the C. diff aggressively especially given CT appearance and her continued leukocytosis and because of the Levaquin, which could have added additional antibiotic pressure, so I will restart the IV Flagyl. 2. Continue p.o. vancomycin. Add Florastor to help replenish the gut flora. 3. Monitor WBCs closely and follow clinically and if there is any deterioration in her clinical status, I would recommend getting surgical evaluation immediately for surgery if needed. 4. We will check a chest x-ray especially given her new requirement for oxygen.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit**  \nThe doctor asked me to see the patient for C. diff colitis.\n\n**Current illness**  \nThe patient is a friendly 72‑year‑old woman who has high blood pressure and was recently diagnosed with C. diff. She was admitted to the hospital on 5/2009 for this infection. On 6/18/2009 she came back with stomach pain, cramps, and ongoing diarrhea. A CT scan of her abdomen showed widespread inflammation of the colon. She was started on IV Flagyl (metronidazole) and IV Levaquin (ciprofloxacin). Because she was nauseous and vomiting, she also received IV Reglan (metoclopramide). Even after treatment, her white blood cell count is still high. She says the nausea and vomiting are gone, but the diarrhea continues. She also feels weak.\n\n**Past medical history**  \n- High blood pressure  \n- High cholesterol  \n- Recent C. diff colitis (now resolved, according to Dr. X; she was fine two weeks ago)\n\n**Past surgical history**  \nNone that matter.\n\n**Social history**  \nDoes not smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs. Lives at home.\n\n**Home medications**  \nAtenolol (for blood pressure) and Mevacor (statin).\n\n**Allergies**  \nNo known drug allergies.\n\n**Review of systems**  \nPositive for diarrhea and stomach pain; otherwise she reports weakness. No cough, sputum, or painful urination. The rest of the 10‑system review is basically normal.\n\n**Physical exam**  \n- **General**: Awake, alert, no obvious distress.  \n- **Vitals**: No fever since admission. Today’s temperature 96.5 °F, heart rate 80, breathing 18, blood pressure 125/60, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L oxygen.  \n- **Head/eyes**: Pupils normal.  \n- **Chest**: Clear lungs.  \n- **Heart**: Normal heart sounds, no crackles.  \n- **Abdomen**: Tender all over, mild rebound tenderness, no guarding. Bowel sounds present.  \n- **Extremities**: No clubbing, cyanosis, or swelling.  \n- **Imaging**: CT of abdomen and pelvis shows diffuse colitis.\n\n**Labs**  \n- White blood cells: 21.5 k/µL  \n- Hemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL  \n- Platelets: 284,000/µL  \n- Neutrophils: 89%  \n- Urinalysis (6/18/2009): No UTI.  \n- Sodium: 130 mEq/L  \n- Potassium: 2.7 mEq/L  \n- Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL  \n- AST/ALT (6/20/2009): Normal  \n- Blood cultures: Negative  \n- Urine culture: Negative  \n- C. diff test: Positive  \n- Stool culture: Negative\n\n**Assessment**  \n1. 72‑year‑old woman with C. diff colitis.  \n2. Diarrhea from the infection and possibly from Reglan (stopped today).  \n3. High white blood cell count from the infection; slight improvement today.  \n4. CT shows possible pleural effusion or thickening on both sides of the chest.  \n5. New need for oxygen; rule out pneumonia.  \n6. High blood pressure.\n\n**Plan**  \n1. Treat the C. diff aggressively because of the CT findings and persistent high white cells. Stop Levaquin (which may add antibiotic pressure) and restart IV Flagyl.  \n2. Continue oral vancomycin. Add Florastor to help restore gut bacteria.  \n3. Monitor white blood cells closely; if her condition worsens, consider surgical evaluation right away.  \n4. Get a chest X‑ray because of the new oxygen requirement."
