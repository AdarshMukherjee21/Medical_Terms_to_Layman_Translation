  "medical": "PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Endoscopy. INDICATIONS: Dysphagia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal ring and active reflux esophagitis. PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure from the parents and patient. The oral cavity is sprayed with lidocaine spray. A bite block is placed. Versed IV 5 mg and 100 mcg of IV fentanyl was given in cautious increments. The GIF-160 diagnostic gastroscope used. The patient was alert during the procedure. The esophagus was intubated under direct visualization. The scope was advanced toward the GE junction with active reflux esophagitis involving the distal one-third of the esophagus noted. The stomach was unremarkable. Retroflexed exam unremarkable. Duodenum not intubated in order to minimize the time spent during the procedure. The patient was alert although not combative. A balloon was then inserted across the GE junction, 15 mm to 18 mm, and inflated to 3, 4.7, and 7 ATM, and left inflated at 18 mm for 45 seconds. The balloon was then deflated. The patient became uncomfortable and a good-size adequate distal esophageal tear was noted. The scope and balloon were then withdrawn. The patient left in good condition. IMPRESSION: Successful dilation of distal esophageal fracture in the setting of active reflux esophagitis albeit mild. PLAN: I will recommend that the patient be on lifelong proton pump inhibition and have repeat endoscopy performed as needed. This has been discussed with the parents. He was sent home with a prescription for omeprazole.",
  "layman": "**Procedures Done:** Endoscopy.  \n\n**Reason for the Procedure:** Difficulty swallowing.  \n\n**After the Procedure Diagnosis:** A ring in the esophagus and active reflux esophagitis (inflammation from stomach acid).  \n\n**What Happened During the Procedure:**  \n- The parents and the patient gave permission before the test.  \n- Lidocaine spray was used in the mouth.  \n- A bite block was put in place.  \n- Small doses of Versed (5 mg) and fentanyl (100 mcg) were given through an IV to keep the patient comfortable.  \n- A GIF‑160 diagnostic scope was used.  \n- The patient stayed awake during the test.  \n- The scope was guided into the esophagus and then to the junction where the esophagus meets the stomach.  \n- Inflammation from reflux was seen in the lower third of the esophagus.  \n- The stomach looked normal.  \n- A backward view of the esophagus was normal.  \n- The small intestine (duodenum) was not examined to keep the test short.  \n- The patient was alert but not upset.  \n- A balloon was placed across the junction, sized 15 mm to 18 mm, and inflated to pressures of 3, 4.7, and 7 ATM. It was kept at 18 mm for 45 seconds.  \n- The balloon was then deflated.  \n- The patient felt uncomfortable and a tear in the lower esophagus was seen.  \n- The scope and balloon were removed.  \n- The patient left the procedure in good condition.  \n\n**Result:** The tear in the lower esophagus was successfully widened, and the reflux inflammation was mild.  \n\n**Plan:** The patient will need lifelong medication to reduce stomach acid and may need another endoscopy if needed. This was discussed with the parents. The patient was sent home with a prescription for omeprazole."
