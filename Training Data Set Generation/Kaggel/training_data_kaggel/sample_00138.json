  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wrist ganglion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wrist ganglion. TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Excision of dorsal wrist ganglion. PROCEDURE: After administering appropriate antibiotics and general anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I made a transverse incision directly over the ganglion. Dissection was carried down through the extensor retinaculum, identifying the 3rd and the 4th compartments and retracting them. I then excised the ganglion and its stalk. In addition, approximately a square centimeter of the dorsal capsule was removed at the origin of stalk, leaving enough of a defect to prevent formation of a one-way valve. We then identified the scapholunate ligament, which was uninjured. I irrigated and closed in layers and injected Marcaine with epinephrine. I dressed and splinted the wound. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",

PROCEDURE: The patient was given antibiotics and general anesthesia. The arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. Blood was removed from the arm with an Esmarch band and a tourniquet was set to 250 mmHg. I made a horizontal cut over the ganglion. I cut through the outer layer of the wrist, found the third and fourth tendon compartments, and moved them aside. I removed the ganglion and its stalk. I also removed about a square‑centimeter of the outer wrist capsule where the stalk attached, leaving a small gap to stop a one‑way valve from forming. I checked the scapholunate ligament and it was intact. I washed the area, closed the layers, and injected a local anesthetic with epinephrine. I covered the wound and put a splint on it. The patient went to recovery in good condition and tolerated the surgery well."
