  "medical": "The patient is a 39-year-old gravida 3, para 2, who is now at 20 weeks and 2 days gestation. This pregnancy is a twin gestation. The patient presents for her fetal anatomical survey. The patient has past obstetrical history notable for a full-term vaginal delivery with 6 pounds, 15 ounce female infant in 2001. She also had a full-term vaginal delivery with 7 pound, 11 ounce male infant in 2002. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient denies any significant past medical history. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient denies any significant surgical history. MEDICATIONS: The patient takes no medications. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: She denies use of cigarettes, alcohol or drugs. FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of birth defects, mental retardation or any psychiatric history. DETAILS: I performed a transabdominal ultrasound today using a 4 MHz transducer. There is a twin gestation in the vertex transverse lie with an anterior placenta and a normal amount of amniotic fluid surrounding both of the twins. The fetal biometry of twin A is as follows. The biparietal diameter is 4.9 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, head circumference 17.6 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 1 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, and femur length is 3.1 cm consistent with 19 weeks and 5 days, and the humeral length is 3.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day. The average gestational age by ultrasound is 20 weeks and 1 day and the estimated fetal weight is 353 g. The following structures are seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey, the shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels and the placenta. Limited in views of baby A with a nasolabial region. The following is the fetal biometry for twin B. The biparietal diameter is 4.7 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, head circumference 17.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, the femur length is 3.3 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 3 days, and the humeral length is 3.1 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, the average gestational age by ultrasound is 22 weeks and 2 days, and the estimated fetal weight is 384 g. The following structures were seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey. The shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels, and the placenta. Limited on today's ultrasound the views of nasolabial region. In summary, this is a twin gestation, which may well be monochorionic at 20 weeks and 1 day. There is like gender and a single placenta. One cannot determine with certainty whether or not this is a monochorionic or dichorionic gestation from the ultrasound today. I sat with the patient and her husband and discussed alternative findings and the complications. We focused our discussion today on the association of twin pregnancy with preterm delivery. We discussed the fact that the average single intrauterine pregnancy delivers at 40 weeks' gestation while the average twin delivery occurs at 35 weeks' gestation. We discussed the fact that 15% of twins deliver prior to 32 weeks' gestation. These are the twins which we have the most concern regarding the long-term prospects of prematurity. We discussed several etiologies of preterm delivery including preterm labor, incompetent cervix, premature rupture of the fetal membranes as well as early delivery from preeclampsia and growth restriction. We discussed the use of serial transvaginal ultrasound to assess for early cervical change and the use of serial transabdominal ultrasound to assess for normal interval growth. We discussed the need for frequent office visits to screen for preeclampsia. We also discussed treatment options such as cervical cerclage, bedrest, tocolytic medications, and antenatal steroids. I would recommend that the patient return in two weeks for further cervical assessment and assessment of fetal growth and well-being. In closing, I do want to thank you very much for involving me in the care of your delightful patient. I did review all of the above findings and recommendations with the patient today at the time of her visit. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I could be of any further help to you. Total visit time 40 minutes.",
  "layman": "The patient is a 39‑year‑old woman who has had three pregnancies and two births. She is currently 20 weeks and 2 days pregnant with twins. She came in for a routine ultrasound that checks the babies’ anatomy.\n\n**Past pregnancy history**  \n- 2001: full‑term vaginal delivery of a 6 lb 15 oz girl.  \n- 2002: full‑term vaginal delivery of a 7 lb 11 oz boy.  \nShe has no other medical or surgical problems, takes no medications, has no drug allergies, and does not smoke, drink, or use drugs. Her family has no history of birth defects or mental health problems.\n\n**Ultrasound findings**  \n- The twins are positioned side‑by‑side (vertex transverse lie) with one placenta that is in front of the uterus.  \n- Both babies have normal amounts of amniotic fluid.  \n- **Baby A**:  \n  - Head width (biparietal diameter): 4.9 cm (about 20 weeks 5 days).  \n  - Head circumference: 17.6 cm (about 20 weeks 1 day).  \n  - Abdominal circumference: 15.0 cm (about 20 weeks 2 days).  \n  - Femur length: 3.1 cm (about 19 weeks 5 days).  \n  - Humerus length: 3.0 cm (about 20 weeks).  \n  - Ultrasound age: 20 weeks 1 day.  \n  - Estimated weight: 353 g.  \n  - All examined structures (head shape, brain parts, spine, face, heart chambers, stomach, kidneys, bladder, limbs, genitals, cord with three vessels, placenta) looked normal. A view of the baby’s mouth area was limited.  \n- **Baby B**:  \n  - Head width: 4.7 cm (about 20 weeks 2 days).  \n  - Head circumference: 17.5 cm (about 20 weeks).  \n  - Abdominal circumference: 15.5 cm (about 20 weeks 5 days).  \n  - Femur length: 3.3 cm (about 20 weeks 3 days).  \n  - Humerus length: 3.1 cm (about 20 weeks 2 days).  \n  - Ultrasound age: 22 weeks 2 days.  \n  - Estimated weight: 384 g.  \n  - All examined structures were normal, with a limited view of the mouth area.\n\n**Summary**  \nThe twins share one placenta, which suggests they might be monochorionic (one placenta) but the ultrasound cannot confirm this for sure. The babies are the same sex and the placenta is single.\n\n**Discussion with the patient**  \nI talked with the patient and her husband about the risks that come with twin pregnancies, especially the chance of giving birth early.  \n- A single baby usually goes to term at 40 weeks.  \n- Twins usually deliver around 35 weeks.  \n- About 15 % of twins are born before 32 weeks, which can affect long‑term health.  \nWe reviewed possible reasons for early birth, such as early labor, a weak cervix, leaking membranes, or complications like high blood pressure or growth problems.  \nWe also discussed monitoring plans: regular ultrasounds to watch the cervix and baby growth, frequent office visits to check for high blood pressure, and possible treatments like a cervical stitch, bed rest, medications to stop labor, or steroids before birth.  \nI recommended another visit in two weeks for a cervical check and to see how the babies are growing.\n\n**Closing**  \nI thanked the patient for trusting me with her care and let her know she can contact me if she has any questions.  \nThe visit lasted about 40 minutes."
