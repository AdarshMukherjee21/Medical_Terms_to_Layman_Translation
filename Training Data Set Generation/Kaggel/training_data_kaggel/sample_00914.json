NAME OF OPERATION: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. FINDINGS: The gallbladder was thickened and showed evidence of chronic cholecystitis. There was a great deal of inflammatory reaction around the cystic duct. The cystic duct was slightly larger. There was a stone impacted in the cystic duct with the gallbladder. The gallbladder contained numerous stones which were small. With the stone impacted in the cystic duct, it was felt that probably none were within the common duct. Other than rather marked obesity, no other significant findings were noted on limited exploration of the abdomen. PROCEDURE: Under general anesthesia after routine prepping and draping, the abdomen was insufflated with the Veress needle, and the standard four trocars were inserted uneventfully. Inspection was made for any entry problems, and none were encountered. After limited exploration, the gallbladder was then retracted superiorly and laterally, and the cystic duct was dissected out. This was done with some difficulty due to the fibrosis around the cystic duct, but care was taken to avoid injury to the duct and to the common duct. In this manner, the cystic duct and cystic artery were dissected out. Care was taken to be sure that the duct that was identified went into the gallbladder and was the cystic duct. The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided, taking care to avoid injury to the common duct. The gallbladder was then dissected free from the gallbladder bed. Again, the gallbladder was somewhat adherent to the gallbladder bed due to previous inflammatory reaction. The gallbladder was dissected free from the gallbladder bed utilizing the endo shears and the cautery to control bleeding. The gallbladder was extracted through the operating trocar site, and the trocar was reinserted. Inspection was made of the gallbladder bed. One or two bleeding areas were fulgurated, and bleeding was well controlled.",

Long‑term inflammation of the gallbladder.  \n\nNAME OF OPERATION: Laparoscopic gallbladder removal.  \nANESTHESIA: General (you will be fully asleep).  \n\nFINDINGS: The gallbladder was thick and showed signs of long‑term inflammation. There was a lot of swelling around the cystic duct, which was a bit larger than normal. A stone was stuck in the cystic duct and the gallbladder. The gallbladder had many small stones. Because the stone was in the cystic duct, it was thought that none were in the common bile duct. Apart from being noticeably overweight, no other major problems were seen during a quick look at the abdomen.  \n\nPROCEDURE: After you were put under general anesthesia and the area was cleaned, the surgeon used a Veress needle to inflate the abdomen and inserted four small tubes (trocars) without any problems. They checked for any issues with the entry and found none. The gallbladder was pulled up and to the side, and the cystic duct was carefully separated. This was a bit hard because of scar tissue around the duct, but the surgeon made sure not to damage the cystic or common ducts. The cystic duct and artery were identified, clipped twice, and cut, taking care to avoid the common duct. The gallbladder was then freed from the liver bed. It was still stuck a bit because of previous inflammation, so the surgeon used scissors and cautery to cut it free and stop bleeding. The gallbladder was removed through one of the trocar sites, and the trocar was put back in. The surgeon checked the liver bed for bleeding, treated one or two spots, and the bleeding was well controlled."
