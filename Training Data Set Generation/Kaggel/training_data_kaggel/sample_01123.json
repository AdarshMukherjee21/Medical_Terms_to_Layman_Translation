  "medical": "EXAM: Bilateral carotid ultrasound. REASON FOR EXAM: Headache. TECHNIQUE: Color grayscale and Doppler analysis is employed. FINDINGS: On the grayscale images, the right common carotid artery demonstrates patency with mild intimal thickening only. At the level of the carotid bifurcation, there is heterogeneous hard plaque present, but without grayscale evidence of greater than 50% stenosis. Right common carotid waveform is normal with a peak systolic velocity of 0.474 m/second and an end-diastolic velocity of 0.131 m/second. The right ECA is patent as well with the velocity measurement 0.910 m/second. The right internal carotid artery at the bifurcation demonstrates plaque formation, but no evidence of greater than 50% stenosis. Proximal peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery is 0.463 m/second with proximal end-diastolic velocity of 0.170. The mid internal carotid peak systolic velocity is 0.564 m/second, and mid ICA end-diastolic velocity is 0.199 m/second. Right ICA distal PSV 0.580 m/second, right ICA distal EDV 0.204 m/second. Vertebral flow is antegrade on the right at 0.469 m/second. On the left, the common carotid artery demonstrates intimal thickening, but is otherwise patent. At the level of the bifurcation, however, there is more pronounced plaque formation with approximately 50% stenosis by the grayscale analysis. See the velocity measurements below: Left carotid ECA measurement 0.938 m/second. Left common carotid PSV 0.686 m/second, and left common carotid end-diastolic velocity 0.137 m/second. Left internal carotid artery again demonstrates prominent focus of hard plaque with up to at least 50% stenosis. This should be further assessed with CTA for more precise measurement. The left proximal ICA/PSV 0.955 m/second, left proximal ICA/EDV 0.287 m/second. There is spectral broadening in the proximal aspect of the carotid waveform. The left carotid ICA mid PSV 0.895, left carotid ICA mid EDV 0.278 with also spectral broadening present. The left distal ICA/PSV 0.561, left distal ICA/EDV 0.206, again the spectral broadening present. Vertebral flow is antegrade at 0.468 m/second. IMPRESSION: The study demonstrates bilateral hard plaque at the bifurcation, left greater than right. There is at least 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its bifurcation and a followup CTA is recommended for further assessment.",
  "layman": "EXAM: Ultrasound of both carotid arteries.  \nREASON: Headache.  \n\nTECHNIQUE: The scan used color, gray‑scale, and Doppler imaging.  \n\nFINDINGS:  \n- On the gray‑scale images, the right common carotid artery is open but has a little thickening of its inner lining.  \n- At the point where the artery splits (bifurcation), there is mixed hard plaque, but it does not block more than 50% of the flow.  \n- The blood flow pattern in the right common carotid is normal. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) is 0.474 m/s and end‑diastolic velocity (EDV) is 0.131 m/s.  \n- The right external carotid artery (ECA) is open, with a velocity of 0.910 m/s.  \n- The right internal carotid artery (ICA) at the bifurcation has plaque but no more than 50% narrowing.  \n  - Proximal (near) PSV 0.463 m/s, EDV 0.170 m/s.  \n  - Mid ICA PSV 0.564 m/s, EDV 0.199 m/s.  \n  - Distal (far) PSV 0.580 m/s, EDV 0.204 m/s.  \n- Blood flow in the right vertebral artery is forward (antegrade) at 0.469 m/s.  \n\nLeft side:  \n- The left common carotid artery shows thickening of the inner lining but is otherwise open.  \n- At the bifurcation, there is more plaque, about 50% narrowing seen on gray‑scale.  \n- Velocity measurements:  \n  - Left ECA 0.938 m/s.  \n  - Left common carotid PSV 0.686 m/s, EDV 0.137 m/s.  \n- The left ICA has a prominent hard plaque with at least 50% narrowing. A CTA scan is needed for a more accurate measurement.  \n  - Proximal PSV 0.955 m/s, EDV 0.287 m/s.  \n  - Mid ICA PSV 0.895 m/s, EDV 0.278 m/s.  \n  - Distal ICA PSV 0.561 m/s, EDV 0.206 m/s.  \n- Spectral broadening (variation in the Doppler signal) is seen in all parts of the left carotid waveform.  \n- Left vertebral artery flow is forward at 0.468 m/s.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \nBoth sides have hard plaque at the artery split, with the left side more severe. The left internal carotid artery has at least 50% narrowing at its split. A follow‑up CTA scan is recommended for a more precise assessment."
