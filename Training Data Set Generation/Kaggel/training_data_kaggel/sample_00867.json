  "medical": "PROBLEM: Rectal bleeding, positive celiac sprue panel. HISTORY: The patient is a 19-year-old Irish-Greek female who ever since elementary school has noted diarrhea, constipation, cramping, nausea, vomiting, bloating, belching, abdominal discomfort, change in bowel habits. She noted that her symptoms were getting increasingly worse and so she went for evaluation and was finally tested for celiac sprue and found to have a positive tissue transglutaminase as well as antiendomysial antibody. She has been on a gluten-free diet for approximately one week now and her symptoms are remarkably improved. She actually has none of these symptoms since starting her gluten-free diet. She has noted intermittent rectal bleeding with constipation, on the toilet tissue. She feels remarkably better after starting a gluten-free diet. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. OPERATIONS: She is status post a tonsillectomy as well as ear tubes. ILLNESSES: Questionable kidney stone. MEDICATIONS: None. HABITS: No tobacco. No ethanol. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives by herself. She currently works in a dental office. FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a mother who is in good health, a father who has joint problems and questionable celiac disease as well. She has two sisters and one brother. One sister interestingly has inflammatory arthritis. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Notable for fever, fatigue, blurred vision, rash and itching; her GI symptoms that were discussed in the HPI are actually resolved in that she started the gluten-free diet. She also notes headaches, anxiety, heat and cold intolerance, excessive thirst and urination. Please see symptoms summary sheet dated April 18, 2005. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a well-developed pleasant 19 female. She has a blood pressure of 120/80, a pulse of 70, she weighs 170 pounds. She has anicteric sclerae. Pink conjunctivae. PERRLA. ENT: MMM. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended and nontender. Good bowel sounds. RECTAL: She has no external hemorrhoids and no probable internal hemorrhoids on exam. LYMPH: No cervical lymphadenopathy. EXTREMITIES: No edema. No rash. NEURO/PSYCH: Orientation, memory, motor and gait are intact. IMPRESSION/PLAN: The patient is a 19-year-old female with what appears to be celiac sprue, that is markedly improved on a gluten-free diet. I discussed with her and her mother that the gold standard really is a small bowel biopsy, but she would have to go back on her gluten diet to obtain the study. At this point in time, she does not seem to be quite interested in that as she feels to be markedly better for the first time in many years. I have given her a handout regarding celiac disease as well as a gluten-free diet and we will go ahead and obtain a small bowel follow through as it seems as if she has had symptoms for many years. We will check a TSH as well as a CBC to make sure she is not anemic and secondary to the rectal bleeding and a sister with inflammatory arthritis, we will go ahead and check a flexible sigmoidoscopy to make sure there are no signs of inflammatory bowel disease.",
  "layman": "**Problem:**  \nThe patient has rectal bleeding and a positive test for celiac disease.\n\n**History:**  \nA 19‑year‑old woman of Irish‑Greek background has had diarrhea, constipation, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, bloating, belching, and changes in her bowel habits since elementary school. Her symptoms have gotten worse over time, so she was tested for celiac disease and found to have positive tissue transglutaminase and anti‑endomysial antibodies. She has been eating a gluten‑free diet for about a week and her symptoms have improved dramatically—she no longer has diarrhea, constipation, or stomach pain. She still has occasional rectal bleeding when she has constipation, but she feels much better after starting the gluten‑free diet.\n\n**Allergies:**  \nNone.\n\n**Past surgeries:**  \nTonsil removal and ear tubes.\n\n**Other illnesses:**  \nPossible kidney stone.\n\n**Medications:**  \nNone.\n\n**Habits:**  \nDoes not smoke or drink alcohol.\n\n**Social history:**  \nLives alone and works in a dental office.\n\n**Family history:**  \nMother is healthy; father has joint problems and may have celiac disease. She has two sisters and a brother; one sister has inflammatory arthritis.\n\n**Review of systems:**  \nShe reports fever, fatigue, blurred vision, rash, itching, headaches, anxiety, feeling hot or cold, and increased thirst and urination. Her gastrointestinal symptoms are now resolved because of the gluten‑free diet. A symptom summary sheet from April 18, 2005, is available.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- **General:** Well‑developed, pleasant 19‑year‑old female. Blood pressure 120/80, pulse 70, weight 170 lb. Eyes clear, no jaundice.  \n- **ENT:** Normal.  \n- **Neck:** Supple.  \n- **Lungs:** Clear.  \n- **Heart:** Regular rhythm.  \n- **Abdomen:** Soft, not swollen or tender. Normal bowel sounds.  \n- **Rectal:** No external hemorrhoids; no obvious internal hemorrhoids.  \n- **Lymph nodes:** No swollen neck nodes.  \n- **Extremities:** No swelling or rash.  \n- **Neuro/psych:** Alert, good memory, normal movement and balance.\n\n**Impression/plan:**  \nThe patient appears to have celiac disease, which has improved with a gluten‑free diet. We discussed that the best test is a small‑bowel biopsy, but that would require her to eat gluten again. She is not interested in that right now because she feels much better. We gave her information about celiac disease and the gluten‑free diet. We will get a small‑bowel follow‑through study because she has had symptoms for many years. We will also check her thyroid hormone (TSH) and complete blood count (CBC) to rule out anemia from the rectal bleeding. Because a sister has inflammatory arthritis, we will do a flexible sigmoidoscopy to check for inflammatory bowel disease."
