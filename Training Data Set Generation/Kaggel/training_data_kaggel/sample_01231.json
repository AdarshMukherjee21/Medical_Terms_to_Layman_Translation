  "medical": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: &quot;I want my colostomy reversed.&quot; HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. A is a pleasant 43-year-old African-American male who presents to our clinic for a colostomy reversal as well as repair of an incisional hernia. The patient states that in November 2007, he presented to High Point Regional Hospital with sharp left lower quadrant pain and was emergently taken to Surgery where he woke up with a &quot;bag.&quot; According to some notes that were faxed to our office from the surgeon in High Point who performed his initial surgery, Dr. X, the patient had diverticulitis with perforated sigmoid colon, and underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch. The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic. The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November. He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X. Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort. He feels that he always has to hold his hand over the hernia to prevent it from prolapsing and causing him even more discomfort. PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 2. Question of hypertension. 3. Status post sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November 2007 at High Point Regional. 4. Status post cholecystectomy. 7. Status post unknown foot surgery. MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Greensboro. He smokes one pack of cigarettes a day and has done so for 15 years. He denies any IV drug use and has an occasional alcohol. FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see history of present illness; otherwise, the review of systems is negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 95.9, pulse 67, blood pressure 135/79, and weight 208 pounds. GENERAL: This is a pleasant African-American male appearing his stated age in no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Moist mucous membranes. Extraocular movements intact. NECK: Supple, no JVD, and no lymphadenopathy. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended with a left lower quadrant stoma. The stoma is pink, protuberant, and productive. The patient also has a midline incisional hernia approximately 6 cm in diameter. It is reducible. Otherwise, there are no further hernias or masses noted. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 43-year-old gentleman who underwent what sounds like a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November of 2007 secondary to perforated colon from diverticulitis. The patient presents for reversal of his colostomy as well as repair of his incisional hernia. I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery. He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment. I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump. He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point. This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today. They were in agreement with this plan. We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag. To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this.",

In November 2007 he went to High Point Regional Hospital with sharp pain in the lower left side of his belly. He was taken to surgery right away and woke up with a colostomy bag. The surgeon who did the operation, Dr. X, told us that Mr. A had a perforated sigmoid colon from diverticulitis. He had a sigmoid colectomy (removal of part of the colon) and an end colostomy with a Hartmann’s pouch. Mr. A did not know about this diagnosis until we explained it to him today.  \n\nSince the surgery, he has developed an incisional hernia. He was seen again by Dr. X in April 2008 and asked if Dr. X could reverse the colostomy and repair the hernia. Because he lost his job and has no insurance, Dr. X referred him to our clinic.

He wants the colostomy reversed and the hernia repaired. I asked him to go back to High Point Regional to get the original surgical notes and pathology results so we can see exactly what was done. He said he would try to get those records and bring them to his next appointment.  \n\nWe scheduled a barium enema to look at the remaining rectal stump. He will return in two weeks to review the imaging and the records from the outside hospital and decide the best next steps. This plan was discussed with Mr. A, his sister, and his significant other, and everyone agreed.  \n\nWe also called a social worker to help Mr. A get more ostomy bags because he said he had none left and was reusing an old one. The social worker and ostomy nurses were able to provide assistance."
