  "medical": "EXAM: MRI head without contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: Severe headaches. INTERPRETATION: Imaging was performed in the axial and sagittal planes using numerous pulse sequences at 1 tesla. Correlation is made with the head CT of 4/18/05. On the diffusion sequence, there is no significant bright signal to indicate acute infarction. There is a large degree of increased signal involving the periventricular white matter extending around to the subcortical regions in symmetrical fashion consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. There is mild chronic ischemic change involving the pons bilaterally, slightly greater on the right, and when correlating with the recent scan, there is an old tiny lacunar infarct of the right brachium pontis measuring roughly 4 mm in size. There are prominent perivascular spaces of the lenticulostriate distribution compatible with the overall degree of moderate to moderately advanced atrophy. There is an old moderate-sized infarct of the mid and lateral aspects of the right cerebellar hemisphere as seen on the recent CT scan. This involves mostly the superior portion of the hemisphere in the superior cerebellar artery distribution. No abnormal mass effect is identified. There are no findings to suggest active hydrocephalus. No abnormal extra-axial collection is identified. There is normal flow void demonstrated in the major vascular systems. The sagittal sequence demonstrates no Chiari malformation. The region of the pituitary/optic chiasm grossly appears normal. The mastoids and paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute findings identified involving the brain. 2. There is prominent chronic cerebral ischemic change as described with mild chronic pontine ischemic changes. There is an old moderate-sized infarct of the superior portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere. 3. Moderate to moderately advanced atrophy.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** MRI of the head without contrast.  \n**Reason for exam:** Severe headaches.  \n\n**Interpretation:**  \nThe MRI was taken in two main views (axial and sagittal) using many different pulse sequences at 1 tesla. The results were compared with a CT scan from 4/18/05.  \n\n- On the diffusion part of the scan, there is no bright spot that would show a new stroke.  \n- There is a large amount of increased signal in the white matter around the brain’s ventricles and in the subcortical areas, on both sides. This pattern matches chronic small‑vessel disease.  \n- There is mild old damage in the pons (the part of the brainstem), a little more on the right side. When we look at the recent scan, we see a small old stroke (about 4 mm) in the right brachium pontis.  \n- The spaces around small blood vessels in the lenticulostriate area are prominent, which fits with moderate to moderately advanced brain shrinkage (atrophy).  \n- An old moderate‑sized stroke is seen in the upper part of the right cerebellar hemisphere, mainly in the area supplied by the superior cerebellar artery.  \n- No abnormal pressure or mass effect is seen.  \n- There is no sign of active hydrocephalus (fluid buildup).  \n- No abnormal fluid collections outside the brain.  \n- Blood flow in the main vessels looks normal.  \n- The sagittal view shows no Chiari malformation.  \n- The pituitary and optic chiasm area looks normal.  \n- The mastoid air cells and sinuses are clear.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. No new acute brain problems were found.  \n2. There is significant chronic small‑vessel disease and mild old damage in the pons. An old moderate stroke is present in the upper right cerebellum.  \n3. The brain shows moderate to moderately advanced shrinkage."
