  "medical": "PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given anesthetic. Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed. It revealed no patholigamentous laxity. We then placed the patient into a beach-chair position, maintaining a neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax. The shoulder was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. We then injected the glenohumeral joint with 60 cc of sterile saline solution. A small stab incision was made 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion. Through this incision, a blunt trocar was placed. We then placed the camera through this cannula and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline solution. An anterior portal was made just below the subscapularis and then we began to inspect the shoulder joint. We found that the articular surface was in good condition. The biceps was found to be intact. There was a SLAP tear noted just posterior to the biceps. Pictures were taken. No Bankart or Hill-Sachs lesions were noted. The rotator cuff was examined and there were no undersurface tears. Pictures were again taken. We then made a lateral portal going through the muscle belly of the rotator cuff. A drill hole was made and then knotless suture anchor was placed to repair this. Pictures were taken. We then washed out the joint with copious amounts of sterile saline solution. It was drained. Our 3 incisions were closed using 3-0 nylon suture. A pain pump catheter was introduced into the shoulder joint. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, ABDs, tape, and sling were placed. The patient was successfully taken out of the beach-chair position, extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then went out and spoke with the patient's family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After the patient gave written permission, she was brought back into the operating room and checked to make sure we had the right person. She was laid on the table on her back and given anesthesia. Once she was fully asleep, the surgeon carefully looked at her shoulder and found no looseness in the ligaments. The patient was then moved to a “beach‑chair” position, keeping her head, neck, and chest straight. The shoulder was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. The surgeon injected 60 cc of sterile salt water into the shoulder joint. A small 2‑cm cut was made just below and a little inside the back corner of the shoulder blade. Through this cut a blunt tube was inserted. The camera was then put through the tube and more sterile salt water was pumped into the joint. A second small opening was made below the subscapularis muscle, and the surgeon started looking inside the joint. The joint surface looked healthy. The biceps tendon was intact, but a tear (called a SLAP tear) was found just behind the biceps. Pictures were taken. No Bankart or Hill‑Sachs injuries were seen. The rotator cuff was checked and no tears were found on the underside. More pictures were taken. A third opening was made through the muscle belly of the rotator cuff. A hole was drilled and a knotless suture anchor was placed to repair the tear. Pictures were taken again. The joint was washed out with lots of sterile salt water and drained. The three small cuts were closed with 3‑0 nylon stitches. A pain‑pump catheter was inserted into the shoulder joint. Xeroform dressings, adhesive strips, tape, and a sling were applied. The patient was taken out of the beach‑chair position, her breathing tube was removed, and she was sent to the recovery room in stable condition. Afterward, I talked with the patient’s family, explained what happened, gave postoperative instructions, and discussed follow‑up care."
