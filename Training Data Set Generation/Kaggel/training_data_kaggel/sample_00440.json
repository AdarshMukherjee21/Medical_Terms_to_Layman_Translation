  "medical": "REASON FOR VISIT: Follow up consultation, second opinion, foreskin. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 2-week-old who at this point has otherwise been doing well. He has a relatively unremarkable foreskin. At this point in time, he otherwise seems to be doing reasonably well. The question is about the foreskin. He otherwise has no other significant issues. Severity low, ongoing since birth two weeks. Thank you for allowing me to see this patient in consultation. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Male exam. Normal and under the penis, report normal uncircumcised 2-week-old. He has a slightly insertion on the penile shaft from the median raphe of the scrotum. IMPRESSION: Slightly high insertion of the median raphe. I see no reason he cannot be circumcised as long as they are careful and do a very complete Gomco circumcision. This kid should otherwise do reasonably well. PLAN: Follow up as needed. But my other recommendation is that this kid as I went over with the mother may actually do somewhat better if he simply has a formal circumcision at one year of age, but may do well with a person who is very accomplished doing a Gomco circumcision.",
  "layman": "**Reason for visit:** Follow‑up and second opinion about the baby’s foreskin.  \n\n**History:** The baby is 2 weeks old and otherwise healthy. His foreskin looks normal and he has no other problems. The only concern is the placement of the foreskin. The issue has been present since birth and is mild.  \n\n**Physical exam:** The baby is male and uncircumcised. The foreskin is attached a little higher on the shaft, starting from the middle line of the scrotum.  \n\n**Impression:** The attachment point is slightly higher than usual. There is no reason he cannot be circumcised if the procedure is done carefully and completely with a Gomco method. He should otherwise do well.  \n\n**Plan:** Follow up as needed. I also suggested that a formal circumcision at one year might be better, but a skilled surgeon can perform a Gomco circumcision now."
