  "medical": "PROCEDURE: Carpal tunnel release with transverse carpal ligament reconstruction. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was made in line with the fourth ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease. The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis. The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially for 2-3 mm, and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf. The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat. The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat. The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with a scissor. After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl. Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture. A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed. The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound, which was then dressed and splinted. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "PROCEDURE: Carpal tunnel release with reconstruction of the transverse carpal ligament.  \nDETAILS: After giving the patient the proper antibiotics and local anesthesia, the arm was cleaned and covered in the usual way. The arm was drained of blood with an Esmarch band and a tourniquet was set to 250 mmHg. A straight cut was made along the fourth finger line, starting from the top of the arm down to about 1 cm below the wrist crease. The surgeon cut through the outer layer of tissue until reaching the thin outer layer (aponeurosis). Small pieces of fat were removed a few millimeters from the side, and the outer layer was cut on that side to leave a longer piece on the ulnar (little finger) side. The ulnar piece of the outer layer was pulled toward the ulna, and the edge of the transverse carpal ligament was found with a clamp. The clamp was gently placed under the ligament to protect the nerves and tendons inside the wrist, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side right onto the clamp. The forearm fascia was cut up close to the cut with scissors. After washing the area with plenty of normal saline, the cut edge of the ligament on the radial side was sewn to the ulnar piece of the outer layer with 4‑0 Vicryl stitches. Care was taken not to trap the motor branch of the median nerve in the stitches. A clamp was placed under the repair to make sure the median nerve was not squeezed. The skin was closed with 5‑0 nylon stitches. A local anesthetic with epinephrine was injected into the wound, which was then covered and splinted. The patient went to recovery in good condition and tolerated the surgery well."
