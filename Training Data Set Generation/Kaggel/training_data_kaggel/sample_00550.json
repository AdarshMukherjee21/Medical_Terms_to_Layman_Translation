  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal radius fracture displaced. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal radius fracture displaced. SURGERY: Closed reduction and placement of long-arm cast, CPT code 25605. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a displaced fracture. She was found to be in perfect alignment after closed reduction and placement of cast. The radial deviation was well corrected. INDICATIONS: The patient is 5 years old. She was seen in our office today 1 week after being placed into a cast for a displaced fracture. She was noted to have significant loss of alignment especially on the lateral view. She was indicated for closed reduction and placed of the long-arm cast. Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family. They wished to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position. General anesthesia was induced without incident. Previous cast was previously removed. An arm was approached and a closed reduction was performed. This was checked under AP and lateral projection and was found to be in adequate alignment. There was very mild residual dorsiflexion deformity noted. A long-arm cast was then placed with plaster and molding. Repeat x-rays demonstrated adequate alignment on both views. The cast was then reinforced with fiberglass. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to recovery room in good condition. There were no complications. All instruments, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of case. PLAN: The patient will be discharged home. She will return in 3 weeks for cast removal and clinical examination. She would likely be placed into a wrist-guard at that time. She has a prescription for Tylenol with codeine elixir.",
  "layman": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The left wrist bone (distal radius) was broken and displaced.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The left wrist bone was still broken and displaced.  \n\nSURGERY: The bone was set back into place without cutting the skin (closed reduction) and a long‑arm cast was applied. (CPT code 25605)  \nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA).  \n\nFINDINGS: The doctor confirmed the bone was broken and displaced. After the closed reduction and cast, the bone was straight and the sideways bend (radial deviation) was fixed.  \n\nINDICATIONS: The patient is a 5‑year‑old girl. She came to our office one week after a cast was put on for a broken wrist. X‑rays showed the bone was not lined up properly, especially on the side view. We decided to do a closed reduction and put on a long‑arm cast. We explained the risks and benefits to her family, and they agreed to proceed.  \n\nPROCEDURE: The girl was taken to the operating room and laid on her back. General anesthesia was started safely. The old cast was removed. The arm was opened and the bone was set back into place. X‑rays taken from the front and side showed the bone was properly aligned, with only a very small remaining bend on the back of the wrist. A long‑arm cast was made with plaster and shaped. A second set of X‑rays confirmed the alignment. The cast was then reinforced with fiberglass. The girl woke up from anesthesia and went to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications. All instruments, sponges, and needles were counted correctly at the end of the case.  \n\nPLAN: The girl will go home. She will come back in 3 weeks for the cast to be removed and a check‑up. At that time she will probably get a wrist guard. She has a prescription for Tylenol with codeine elixir."
