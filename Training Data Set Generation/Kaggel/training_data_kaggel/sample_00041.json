  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: Left arm and hand numbness. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained with 5 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: There is an approximately 5-mm shift of the midline towards the right side. Significant low attenuation is seen throughout the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. There is loss of the cortical sulci on the right side. These findings are compatible with edema. Within the right parietal lobe, a 1.8 cm, rounded, hyperintense mass is seen. No hydrocephalus is evident. The calvarium is intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: A 5 mm midline shift to the left side secondary to severe edema of the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. A 1.8 cm high attenuation mass in the right parietal lobe is concerning for hemorrhage given its high density. A postcontrast MRI is required for further characterization of this mass. Gradient echo imaging should be obtained.",

Images were taken every 5 mm.\n\n**What was seen**  \n- The brain’s midline is shifted about 5 mm to the right.  \n- Large areas of low‑density (lighter) tissue are seen in the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, indicating swelling.  \n- The brain folds (sulci) on the right side are flattened.  \n- In the right parietal lobe there is a round, bright spot about 1.8 cm in size.  \n- The skull is intact and the sinuses look normal.  \n- There is no enlargement of the brain’s fluid spaces (no hydrocephalus).\n\n**Interpretation**  \nThe 5 mm shift of the midline is caused by severe swelling of the right side of the brain.  \nThe 1.8 cm bright spot in the right parietal lobe is likely a bleed because of its high density.  \nAn MRI with contrast is needed to look at this spot in more detail, and a gradient‑echo MRI sequence should also be performed."
