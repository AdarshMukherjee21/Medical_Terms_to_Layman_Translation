  "medical": "CC: Headache HX: This 16 y/o RHF was in good health, until 11:00PM, the evening of 11/27/87, when she suddenly awoke from sleep with severe headache. Her parents described her as holding her head between her hands. She had no prior history of severe headaches. 30 minutes later she felt nauseated and vomited. The vomiting continued every 30 minutes and she developed neck stiffness. At 2:00AM on 11/28/97, she got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed in her mother's arms. Her mother noted she appeared weak on the left side. Shortly after this she experienced fecal and urinary incontinence. She was taken to a local ER and transferred to UIHC. PMH/FHX/SHX: completely unremarkable FHx. Has boyfriend and is sexually active. Denied drug/ETOH/Tobacco use. MEDS: Oral Contraceptive pill QD. EXAM: BP152/82 HR74 RR16 T36.9C MS: Somnolent and difficult to keep awake. Prefer to lie on right side because of neck pain/stiffness. Answers appropriately though when questioned. CN: No papilledema noted. Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2. EOM Intact. Face: ?left facial weakness. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: Upper extremities: 5/3 with left pronator drift. Lower extremities: 5/4 with LLE weakness evident throughout. Coordination: left sided weakness evident. Station: left pronator drift. Gait: left hemiparesis. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. No clonus. Plantars were flexor bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: The patient underwent emergent CT Brain. This revealed a perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage and contrast enhancing structures in the medial aspect of the parietotemporal region. She then underwent a 4-vessel cerebral angiogram. This study was unremarkable except for delayed transit of the contrast material through the vascular system of the brain and poor opacification of the straight sinus. This suggested straight sinus thromboses. MRI Brain was then done; this was unremarkable and did not show sign of central venous thrombosis. CBC/Blood Cx/ESR/PT/PTT/GS/CSF Cx/ANA were negative. Lumbar puncture on 12/1/87 revealed an opening pressure of 55cmH20, RBC18550, WBC25, 18neutrophils, 7lymphocytes, Protein25mg/dl, Glucose47mg/dl, Cx negative. The patient was assumed to have had a SAH secondary to central venous thrombosis due to oral contraceptive use. She recovered well, but returned to Neurology at age 32 for episodic blurred vision and lightheadedness. EEG was compatible with seizure tendency (right greater than left theta bursts from the mid-temporal regions), and she was recommended an anticonvulsant which she refused.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:** Headache  \n**History:** A 16‑year‑old girl who had been healthy suddenly woke up at 11:00 PM on November 27, 1987 with a severe headache. Her parents saw her holding her head in her hands. She had never had a serious headache before. About 30 minutes later she felt nauseous and vomited. She vomited again every 30 minutes and her neck became stiff. At 2:00 AM on November 28, she tried to get up to use the bathroom and collapsed into her mother’s arms. Her mother noticed she was weak on the left side. Soon after she had both fecal and urinary incontinence. She was taken to a local emergency room and then transferred to UIHC.\n\n**Past medical, family, and social history:** No significant medical or family problems. She has a boyfriend and is sexually active. She does not use drugs, alcohol, or tobacco. She takes an oral contraceptive pill daily.\n\n**Medications:** Oral contraceptive pill once a day.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \n- Blood pressure 152/82 mm Hg, heart rate 74 bpm, breathing 16/min, temperature 36.9 °C.  \n- She was sleepy and hard to keep awake. She preferred lying on her right side because of neck pain. She answered questions appropriately.  \n- No swelling of the optic discs. Pupils were equal (4/4) and narrowed to 2/2. Eye movements were normal.  \n- Facial weakness on the left side.  \n- Motor: Upper limbs 5/3 with left pronator drift. Lower limbs 5/4 with weakness in the left leg throughout.  \n- Coordination: left‑side weakness.  \n- Reflexes 2/2 everywhere, no clonus. Plantar reflexes flexor on both sides.  \n- Genital exam normal.\n\n**Course:**  \n- An emergency CT scan of the brain showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage around the midbrain and contrast‑enhancing areas in the medial part of the parietotemporal region.  \n- A 4‑vessel cerebral angiogram was normal except for delayed blood flow and poor filling of the straight sinus, suggesting a straight sinus clot.  \n- An MRI of the brain was normal and did not show central venous thrombosis.  \n- Blood tests (CBC, blood cultures, ESR, PT, PTT, glucose, CSF cultures, ANA) were all negative.  \n- A lumbar puncture on December 1, 1987 showed high opening pressure (55 cm H₂O), many red blood cells (18,550), 25 white cells (18 neutrophils, 7 lymphocytes), protein 25 mg/dl, glucose 47 mg/dl, and no infection.  \n- The doctors thought the subarachnoid hemorrhage was caused by a central venous clot related to her oral contraceptive use.  \n- She recovered well. At age 32 she returned to neurology for occasional blurred vision and lightheadedness. An EEG showed a tendency to seizures (more activity on the right side), and she was advised to take an anticonvulsant, which she declined."
