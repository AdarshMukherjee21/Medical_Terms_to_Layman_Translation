PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Austin-Moore bipolar hemiarthroplasty, left hip utilizing a medium fenestrated femoral stem with a medium 0.8 mm femoral head, a 50 mm bipolar cup. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #2, administered a subarachnoid block anesthetic and was then positioned in the right lateral decubitus position on the beanbag on the operative table. The right lower extremity was protectively padded. The left leg was propped with multiple blankets. The hip was then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A posterior incision was made on the posterolateral aspect of the left hip down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery. Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly. The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa. Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line. They were then reflected distally. The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery. Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint. The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum. Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum. The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris. The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated. A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur. The T-handle broach was then passed down the canal. The canal was then sequentially broached up to a medium broach. The calcar was then plained with the hand plainer. The trial components were positioned into place. The medium component fit fairly well with the medium 28 mm femoral head. Once the trial reduction was performed, the hip was taken through range of motion. There was physiologic crystalling with longitudinal traction. There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees. The trial implants were then removed. The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit. The implant was then impacted into place. The 28 mm femoral head was impacted on the mortise stapler of the femoral stem followed by placement of the 50 mm bipolar cup. The acetabulum was once again inspected, was free of debris. The hip was reduced. It was taken through full range of motion. There was no tendency for dislocation. The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution. The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Ethibond suture. External rotators were then reapproximated to the posterior intertrochanteric line utilizing #1 Ethibond in a modified Kessler type stitch. The wound was once again copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Gluteus fascia was approximated with interrupted #1 Ethibond. Subcutaneous layers were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples. A bulky dressing was applied to the wound. The patient was then transferred to the hospital bed, an abductor pillow was positioned into place. Circulatory status was intact to the extremity at completion of the case.",

The patient was taken to operating room #2, given a spinal (subarachnoid) block, and laid on a beanbag in a right‑side‑up position.  \n2. The right leg was padded for protection; the left leg was held up with blankets.  \n3. The left hip area was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes.  \n4. A cut was made on the back side of the left hip, down through the skin and fatty tissue.  \n5. Bleeding was stopped with an electric cautery device.  \n6. The outer layer of the gluteal muscle was cut along the skin line and the muscle was split toward the back.  \n7. The outer rotator muscles were found after removing the bursa over the trochanter.  \n8. A clamp was used to separate these muscles from the joint capsule; they were cut from their attachment at the back of the trochanter and moved down.  \n9. The joint capsule was opened in a “T” shape with cautery.  \n10. Blood clots came out of the joint.  \n11. A cork screw was driven into the femoral head and removed from the socket.  \n12. Bone fragments from the neck and socket were taken out.  \n13. The socket was checked and found clean.  \n14. The upper part of the femur was brought into the wound with the hip turned inward.  \n15. A special chisel removed the spongy bone from the top of the femur.  \n16. A T‑shaped broach was slid down the femur canal.  \n17. The canal was widened step‑by‑step until a medium‑size broach fit.  \n18. The calcar (the dense bone at the top) was flattened with a hand plainer.  \n19. Trial (test) components were put in place.  \n20. The medium component fit well with a 28 mm femoral head.  \n21. The hip was moved through its range of motion; it stayed stable and did not dislocate even when flexed past 90°.  \n22. The trial parts were removed.  \n23. The socket was washed thoroughly with gentamicin solution and dried.  \n24. The medium perforated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large piece of bone from the femoral head into its holes, making it slightly larger than the implant for a snug fit.  \n25. The stem was driven into place.  \n26. The 28 mm femoral head was attached to the stem with a mortise stapler, then the 50 mm bipolar cup was put on the socket.  \n27. The socket was checked again and was clean.  \n28. The hip was reduced (put back together) and moved through full motion; it stayed stable.  \n29. The wound was washed again with gentamicin solution.  \n30. The joint capsule was stitched closed with interrupted #1 Ethibond sutures.  \n31. The outer rotator muscles were re‑tied to the back of the trochanter with #1 Ethibond in a modified Kessler stitch.  \n32. The wound was washed again and dried.  \n33. The gluteal fascia was stitched closed with interrupted #1 Ethibond.  \n34. The subcutaneous tissue was stitched with interrupted #2‑0 Vicryl.  \n35. The skin was closed with staples.  \n36. A thick dressing was applied.\n\nThe patient was moved to a hospital bed with an abductor pillow in place. Blood flow to the leg was normal at the end of the surgery."
