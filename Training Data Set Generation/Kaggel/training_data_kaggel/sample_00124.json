  "medical": "INDICATIONS: Chest pain. STRESS TECHNIQUE: The patient exercised for 5.0 minutes to a heart rate of 133. ECG was normal. Patient achieved 7.0 METS. IMAGE TECHNIQUE: The patient was injected with 4.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system. IMAGE ANALYSIS: There is normal LV myocardial perfusion. The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 79%. There is normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Normal ECG stress. 2. Reduced aerobic capacity of 7 METS. 3. Normal LV myocardial perfusion. 4. Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 79%. 5. Normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the test:** Chest pain.  \n\n**Stress test:** The patient ran on a treadmill for 5 minutes until the heart rate reached 133 beats per minute. The ECG during the test was normal. The patient reached a level of 7 METS, which shows how well the heart can use oxygen.  \n\n**Imaging:** The patient was given 4.2 millicuries of thallium chloride, a radioactive tracer, and then scanned with a gated SPECT machine.  \n\n**Results:**  \n- The left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) shows normal blood flow.  \n- The left ventricle pumps out 79% of the blood it receives, which is normal.  \n- The walls of the left ventricle move normally, both overall and in specific areas.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n1. Normal ECG during stress.  \n2. The patient’s aerobic capacity was 7 METS.  \n3. Normal blood flow to the left ventricle.  \n4. Normal pumping function (79% ejection fraction).  \n5. Normal wall motion of the left ventricle."
