  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urinary retention. 2. Benign prostate hypertrophy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urinary retention. 2. Benign prostate hypertrophy. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). ANESTHESIA: Spinal. RESECTION TIME: Less than one hour. INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 62-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and progressive obstructive voiding symptoms and enlarged prostate 60 g on ultrasound, office cystoscopy confirmed this. PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE: Informed written consent was obtained. The patient was taken to the operative suite, administered spinal anesthetic and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. She was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion. A #27-French resectoscope was inserted utilizing the visual obturator blanching the bladder. The bladder was visualized in all quadrants, no bladder tumors or stones were noted. Ureteral orifices were visualized and did appear to be near the enlarged median lobe. Prostate showed trilobar prostatic enlargement. There were some cellules and tuberculations noted. The visual obturator was removed. The resectoscope was then inserted utilizing the #26 French resectoscope loop. Resection was performed initiating at the bladder neck and at the median lobe. This was taken down to the circular capsular fibers. Attention was then turned to the left lateral lobe and this was resected from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock down to the capsular fibers maintaining hemostasis along the way and taking care not to resect beyond the level of the verumontanum. Ureteral orifices were kept out of harm's way throughout the case. Resection was then performed from the 3 o'clock position to the 6 o'clock position in similar fashion. Attention was then turned to the right lateral lobe and this was resected again in a similar fashion maintaining hemostasis along the way. The resectoscope was then moved to the level of the proximal external sphincter and trimming of the apex was performed. Open prostatic fossa was noted. All chips were evacuated via Ellik evacuator and #24 French three-way Foley catheter was inserted and irrigated. Clear return was noted. The patient was then hooked up to better irrigation. The patient was cleaned, reversed for anesthetic, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition. PLAN: We will admit with antibiotics, pain control, and bladder irrigation possible void trial in the morning.",

Benign enlarged prostate  \n\n**Procedures performed:**  \n1. Cystourethroscopy (looking inside the bladder and urethra)  \n2. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) – cutting away part of the enlarged prostate through the urethra  \n\n**Anesthesia:** Spinal  \n\n**Resection time:** Less than one hour  \n\n**Reason for the procedure:**  \nA 62‑year‑old man has been having trouble urinating and has a prostate that has grown to 60 g on ultrasound. Office cystoscopy confirmed the enlargement.  \n\n**Procedure details:**  \nThe patient gave written consent and was taken to the operating room. A spinal anesthetic was given and he was positioned on his back with legs up. The area was cleaned and covered in a sterile way.  \n\nA #27‑French resectoscope (a thin tube with a light and camera) was inserted. The bladder was seen in all four corners; no tumors or stones were found. The openings of the kidneys (ureteral orifices) were seen near the enlarged middle part of the prostate. The prostate had three lobes that were enlarged.  \n\nThe resectoscope was then changed to a #26‑French loop. Cutting started at the bladder neck and the middle lobe, going down to the outer layer of the prostate. The left side lobe was cut from the top (12 o’clock) to the side (3 o’clock) down to the outer layer, keeping the blood under control and staying above the verumontanum (a small bump in the urethra). The kidney openings were kept safe. Cutting continued from 3 o’clock to 6 o’clock on the left side. The right side lobe was cut in the same way, again keeping the blood under control.  \n\nThe scope was moved to the upper part of the external sphincter (the muscle that controls urination) and the tip of the prostate was trimmed. The space where the prostate used to be was open. All the tissue pieces were removed with an Ellik evacuator. A #24‑French three‑way Foley catheter (a tube that drains urine) was inserted and flushed. Clear urine returned. The patient was connected to a better irrigation system.  \n\nAfter cleaning, the anesthetic was reversed and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nThe patient will stay in the hospital with antibiotics, pain medication, and possibly bladder irrigation. A trial of urination will be attempted in the morning."
