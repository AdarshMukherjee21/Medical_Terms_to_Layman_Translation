  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic cholecystitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic cholecystitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. COMPLICATIONS: None. CONDITION: Stable. DRAINS: None. DISPOSITION: To recovery room and to home. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. FINDINGS: Consistent with chronic cholecystitis. Final pathology is pending. INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: Briefly, the patient is a 38-year-old male referred with increasingly severe more frequent right upper quadrant abdominal pain, more after meals, had a positive ultrasound for significant biliary sludge. He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities. The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion. Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine. The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade. The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg. The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision. The right upper quadrant was well visualized. The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions. The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector. Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp. The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided. The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided. The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis. Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear. No active bleeding or oozing was seen. All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place. The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port. The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology. The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization. The insufflation was allowed to escape. The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures. Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.",
  "layman": "Pre‑operative diagnosis: chronic gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis).  \nPost‑operative diagnosis: same.  \nProcedure performed: laparoscopic removal of the gallbladder.  \nBlood loss: minimal.  \nAnesthesia: general anesthesia with a breathing tube.  \nComplications: none.  \nCondition: stable.  \nDrains: none.  \nDisposition: recovery room, then home.  \nFluids given: crystalloid.  \nFindings: consistent with chronic cholecystitis; final pathology still pending.  \n\nIndications for the procedure:  \nA 38‑year‑old man had increasingly severe right‑upper‑abdominal pain, especially after meals. Ultrasound showed significant bile sludge. He gave informed consent for surgery.  \n\nProcedure details:  \nThe patient was identified in the pre‑anesthesia area, taken to the operating room, laid on his back, and given general anesthesia with a breathing tube. He was positioned correctly, padded, and had compression stockings and pneumatic devices on his legs. The front of his abdomen was cleaned and covered with sterile drapes. Local anesthetic (lidocaine and ropivacaine) was injected. A small incision was made at the belly button with a scalpel and deepened with cautery to the abdominal wall. A blunt cannula was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was inflated with carbon dioxide to 15 mmHg. Two additional ports were placed in the upper abdomen. The gallbladder was seen to be swollen and stuck to surrounding tissue. The surgeon grasped the top of the gallbladder and pulled it forward and up, then cut the scar tissue around it with a combination of instruments. The cystic duct and artery were identified, clipped three times each, and cut. The gallbladder was removed from the liver using cautery, with good control of bleeding. The cavity was irrigated and checked for bleeding; everything was clear. The gallbladder was placed in a bag and removed through the belly‑button incision. The abdomen was inspected, the gas released, and the belly‑button incision closed with sutures. The skin was closed with fine sutures and covered with sterile dressings. The patient tolerated the operation well."
