  "medical": "CC: Fall with subsequent nausea and vomiting. HX: This 52 y/o RHM initailly presented in 10/94 with a two year hisotry of gradual progressive difficulty with speech. He &quot;knew what he wanted to say, but could not say it.&quot; His speech was slurred and he found it difficult to control his tongue. Examination at that time was notable for phonemic paraphasic errors, fair repetition of short phrases with decreased fluency, and slurred nasal speech. He could read, but could not write. He exhibited facial-limb apraxia, decreased gag reflex and positive grasp reflex. He was thougth to have possible Pick's disease vs. Cortical Basal Ganglia Degeneration. On 11/18/94, he fell and was seen in Neurology clinic on 11/23/94. EEG showed borderline background slowing and no other abnormalities. An MRI on 11/8/94, revealed mild atrophy of the left temporal lobe. Neuropsychological evaluations were obtained on 10/25/94 and 11/8/94. These were consistent with progressive aphasia and apraxia with relative sparing of nonverbal reasoning. He reported consuming 8 beers on the evening of 1/1/95. On 1/2/95, at 9:30AM, he fell forward while stading in his kitchen and struck his forehead on the counter top, and then struck his occiput on the floor. He subsequently developed nausea and vomiting, tinnitus, vertigo, headache and mild shortness of breath. He was taken to the ETC at UIHC. Skull films were negative and he was treated with IV Compazine and IV fluid hydration and sent home. His nausea and vomiting persisted and he became generally weak. He returned to the ETC at UIHC on 1/5/95. HCT scan revealed a right frontal SDH containing signs of both chronic and acute bleeding. MEDS: None. PMH: 1)fell in 1990 from 15 feet up and landed on his feet sustaining crush injury to both feet and ankles.

Non-fluent speech and able to say single syllable words such as &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;. He comprehended speech, but could not repeat or write. CN: Pupils 4/3.5 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. EOM were full and smooth. Optic disks were flat and without sign of hemorrhage. Moderate facial apraxia, but had intact facial sensation. Motor: 5/5 strength with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: no abnormalities noted. Coord: Decreased RAM in the RUE. He had difficulty mmicking movements and postures with his RUE Gait: ND. Station: No truncal ataxia, but he had a slight RUE upward drift. Reflexes 2/2 BUE, 2+/2+ patellae, 2/2 archilles, and plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Rectal exam was unremarkable. The rest of the General Physical exam was unremarkable. HEENT: atraumatic normocephalic skull. No carotid bruitts. COURSE: PT, PTT, CBC, GS, UA and Skull XR were negative. HCT brain, revealed a left frontal SDH with acute and cronic componenets. He was markedly orthostatic during the first few days of his hospital stay. He was given a 3 day trial of Florinef, which showed mild to moderate improvement of his symptoms of lightheadedness. This improved still further with a trial of Sigvaris pressure stockings. A second HCT was obtained on 12/10/94 and revealed decreased intensity and sized of the left frontal SDH. He was discharged home. His ideomotor apraxia worsened by 1/96. He developed seizures and was treated with CBZ. He progressively worsened and his overall condition was marked by aphasia, dysphagia, apraxia, and rigidity. He was last seen in 10/96 and the working diagnosis was CBGD vs. Pick's Disease.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: He fell and then felt nauseous and vomited.\n\nHistory of present illness: A 52‑year‑old right‑handed man first came to the hospital in October 1994 with a two‑year history of gradually worsening speech problems. He said he knew what he wanted to say but could not speak it. His speech was slurred and he had trouble moving his tongue. At that time the exam showed he made errors in the sounds of words, could repeat short phrases only somewhat, and his speech had a nasal quality. He could read but could not write. He also had trouble moving his face and arms in purposeful ways, a weak gag reflex, and a reflex where he grasped objects when touched. Doctors thought he might have Pick’s disease or a degeneration of the basal ganglia.\n\nOn November 18 1994 he fell and was seen in the neurology clinic on November 23. An EEG showed only mild slowing and no other problems. An MRI on November 8 showed mild shrinkage of the left temporal lobe. Neuropsychological tests on October 25 and November 8 confirmed progressive language loss and movement problems, but his non‑verbal reasoning was still okay.\n\nHe drank eight beers on the night of January 1 1995. The next day at 9:30 a.m. he fell forward while standing in his kitchen, hit his forehead on the counter and then hit the back of his head on the floor. After that he felt nauseous, vomited, had ringing in his ears, dizziness, a headache, and mild shortness of breath. He was taken to the emergency department at the University of Illinois Hospital. X‑rays of his skull were normal. He was given IV medication (Compazine) and fluids and sent home. His nausea and vomiting continued and he felt weak. He returned to the emergency department on January 5. A CT scan showed a right‑frontal subdural hematoma with both old and new bleeding.\n\nPast medical history:  \n1) In 1990 he fell from 15 feet, landed on his feet, and had crush injuries to both feet and ankles. He briefly lost consciousness but had no head injury.  \n2) Progressive language loss. In October 1993 he could still draw blueprints and write checks for his family business.  \n3) He had a left front‑parietal headache for 1½ years before October 1994. The headaches still happen about once a week.  \n4) He had a right ankle fusion in April 1994; another fusion is still pending.\n\nFamily history: No family history of neurological disease.\n\nSocial history: He is divorced and lives with his girlfriend. He has one child with his girlfriend and three children from his previous marriage. He quit smoking more than 15 years ago. He drinks 1–2 beers a day. He used to work as an iron worker.\n\nPhysical exam: Blood pressure 128/83, heart rate 68, breathing 18, temperature 36.5 °C. When lying down, BP 142/71, HR 64; when sitting, BP 127/73, HR 91 and he felt light‑headed. He looked somewhat distressed and kept holding his forehead. He was aware of himself, his place, and the time. His speech was slurred and difficult to understand; he could only say single‑syllable words like “up” or “down.” He understood speech but could not repeat it or write. His pupils were 4 mm and 3.5 mm, getting smaller to 2 mm when light was shone. Eye movements were normal. His optic discs were normal. He had moderate difficulty moving his face but could feel facial sensations. Muscle strength was normal (5/5) with normal bulk and tone. He had no sensory problems. Coordination of his right arm was reduced; he had trouble copying movements with that arm. His gait was normal. He had no balance problems but his right arm drifted slightly upward. Reflexes were normal in both arms, slightly brisk in the knees, normal in the ankles, and the plantar reflex was flexor on both sides. Rectal exam was normal. The rest of the general exam was normal. Head, ears, eyes, nose, throat: normal skull, no bruises on the carotid area.\n\nCourse: Blood tests (PT, PTT, CBC, electrolytes, urinalysis) and skull X‑ray were normal. A CT scan of the brain showed a left‑frontal subdural hematoma with both old and new bleeding. He was very light‑headed when standing for the first few days. He was given a 3‑day trial of Florinef, which helped his light‑headedness a little. The improvement was better with pressure stockings (Sigvaris). A second CT on December 10 1994 showed the hematoma was smaller and less intense. He was discharged home. By January 1996 his movement problems had worsened. He had seizures and was treated with carbamazepine. His condition continued to get worse, with language loss, difficulty swallowing, movement problems, and stiffness. He was last seen in October 1996 and the doctors still thought he had either basal ganglia degeneration or Pick’s disease."
