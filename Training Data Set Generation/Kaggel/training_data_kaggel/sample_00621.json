  "medical": "CC: Headache. HX: This 51 y/o RHM was moving furniture several days prior to presentation when he struck his head (vertex) against a door panel. He then stepped back and struck his back on a trailer hitch. There was no associated LOC but he felt &quot;dazed.&quot; He complained a HA since the accident. The following day he began experiencing episodic vertigo lasting several minutes with associated nausea and vomiting. He has been lying in bed most of the time since the accident. He also complained of transient left lower extremity weakness. The night before admission he went to his bedroom and his girlfriend heard a loud noise. She found him on the floor unable to speak or move his left side well. He was taken to a local ER. In the ER experienced a spell in which he stared to the right for approximately one minute. During this time he was unable to speak and did not seem to comprehend verbal questions. This resolved. ER staff noted decreased left sided movement and a left Babinski sign. He was given valium 5 mg, and DPH 1.0g. A HCT was performed and he was transferred to UIHC. PMH: DM, Coronary Artery Disease, Left femoral neuropathy of unknown etiology. Multiple head trauma in past (?falls/fights). MEDS: unknown oral med for DM. SHX: 10+pack-year h/o Tobacco use; quit 2 years ago. 6-pack beer/week. No h/o illicit drug use. FHX: unknown. EXAM: 70BPM, BP144/83, 16RPM, 36.0C MS: Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Fluent speech. CN: left lower facial weakness with right gaze preference. Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Optic disks flat. MOTOR: decreased spontaneous movement of left-sided extremities. 5/4 strength in both upper and lower extremities. Normal muscle tone and bulk. SENSORY: withdrew equally to noxious stimulation in all four extremities. GAIT/STATION/COORDINATION: not tested. The general physical exam was unremarkable. During the exam the patient experienced a spell during which his head turned and eyes deviated to the leftward, and his right hand twitched. The entire spell lasted one minute. During the episode he was verbally unresponsive. He appeared groggy and lethargic after the event. HCT without contrast: 11/18/92: right frontal skull fracture with associated minimal epidural hematoma and small subdural hematoma, as well as some adjacent subarachnoid blood and brain contusion. LABS: CBC, GS, PT/PTT were all WNL. COURSE: The patient was diagnosed with a right frontal SAH/contusion and post traumatic seizures. DPH was continued and he was given a Librium taper for possible alcoholic withdrawal. A neurosurgical consult was obtained. He did not receive surgical intervention and was discharged 12/1/92. Neuropsychological testing on 11/25/92 revealed: poor orientation to time or place and poor attention. Anterograde verbal and visual memory was severely impaired. Speech became mildly dysarthric when fatigued. Defective word finding. Difficulty copying 2 of 3 three dimensional figures. Recent head injury as well as a history of ETOH abuse and multiple prior head injuries probably contribute to his deficits.",

He hit the top of his head on a door, then stepped back and hit his back on a trailer hitch. He did not lose consciousness but felt dazed. He has had a headache since the accident. The next day he had brief episodes of dizziness that lasted a few minutes, with nausea and vomiting. He has been mostly in bed since then. He also said his left leg felt weak for a short time. The night before he was admitted, he went to his bedroom and his girlfriend heard a loud noise. She found him on the floor, unable to speak or move his left side well. He was taken to a local emergency department. In the ER he had a one‑minute spell during which he stared to the right, could not speak, and seemed not to understand questions. The spell ended. ER staff noted weak movement on the left side and a positive Babinski sign. He was given 5 mg of Valium and 1 g of DPH. A head CT was done and he was transferred to UIHC.  \n\nPast medical history: diabetes, coronary artery disease, left femoral neuropathy of unknown cause, and several previous head injuries from falls or fights. Medications: unknown oral diabetes medication.  \n\nSocial history: smoked more than 10 pack‑years, quit 2 years ago; drinks about six beers a week; no drug use. Family history: unknown.  \n\nExamination: heart rate 70, blood pressure 144/83, respiratory rate 16, temperature 36.0 °C. He was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Speech was fluent. Cranial nerves: weakness on the lower left side of the face and a preference to look right. Pupils equal and 3 mm, constricting to 2 mm with light. Optic discs normal. Motor: reduced spontaneous movement on the left side. Strength 5/4 in all upper and lower extremities. Muscle tone and bulk normal. Sensation: normal response to painful stimuli in all four limbs. Gait, stance, coordination were not tested. General physical exam was normal.  \n\nDuring the exam he had another one‑minute spell: his head turned left, eyes looked left, and his right hand twitched. He did not speak during the spell and seemed groggy afterward.  \n\nHead CT without contrast (11/18/92) showed a right frontal skull fracture, a small epidural hematoma, a small subdural hematoma, some blood in the subarachnoid space, and a brain contusion. Labs (CBC, electrolytes, PT/PTT) were all normal.  \n\nCourse: He was diagnosed with a right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage/contusion and post‑traumatic seizures. DPH was continued and he was given a Librium taper for possible alcohol withdrawal. A neurosurgical consult was obtained; no surgery was performed. He was discharged on 12/1/92.  \n\nNeuropsychological testing on 11/25/92 showed poor orientation to time and place, poor attention, severe problems with new verbal and visual memory, mild slurred speech when tired, trouble finding words, and difficulty copying two of three three‑dimensional figures. His recent head injury, alcohol abuse, and multiple prior head injuries likely contributed to these deficits."
