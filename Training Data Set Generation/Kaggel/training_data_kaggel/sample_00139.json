  "medical": "EXAM: CTA chest pulmonary angio. REASON FOR EXAM: Evaluate for pulmonary embolism. TECHNIQUE: Postcontrast CT chest pulmonary embolism protocol, 100 mL of Isovue-300 contrast is utilized. FINDINGS: There are no filling defects in the main or main right or left pulmonary arteries. No central embolism. The proximal subsegmental pulmonary arteries are free of embolus, but the distal subsegmental and segmental arteries especially on the right are limited by extensive pulmonary parenchymal, findings would be discussed in more detail below. There is no evidence of a central embolism. As seen on the prior examination, there is a very large heterogeneous right chest wall mass, which measures at least 10 x 12 cm based on axial image #35. Just superior to the mass is a second heterogeneous focus of neoplasm measuring about 5 x 3.3 cm. Given the short interval time course from the prior exam, dated 01/23/09, this finding has not significantly changed. However, there is considerable change in the appearance of the lung fields. There are now bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and moderate on the left with associated atelectasis. There are also extensive right lung consolidations, all new or increased significantly from the prior examination. Again identified is a somewhat spiculated region of increased density at the right lung apex, which may indicate fibrosis or scarring, but the possibility of primary or metastatic disease cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax in the interval. On the mediastinal windows, there is presumed subcarinal adenopathy, with one lymph node measuring roughly 12 mm suggestive of metastatic disease here. There is aortic root and arch and descending thoracic aortic calcification. There are scattered regions of soft plaque intermixed with this. The heart is not enlarged. The left axilla is intact in regards to adenopathy. The inferior thyroid appears unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen discloses a region of lower density within the right hepatic lobe, this finding is indeterminate, and if there is need for additional imaging in regards to hepatic metastatic disease, follow up ultrasound. Spleen, adrenal glands, and upper kidneys appear unremarkable. Visualized portions of the pancreas are unremarkable. There is extensive rib destruction in the region of the chest wall mass. There are changes suggesting prior trauma to the right clavicle. IMPRESSION: 1. Again demonstrated is a large right chest wall mass. 2. No central embolus, distal subsegmental and segmental pulmonary artery branches are in part obscured by the pulmonary parenchymal findings, are not well assessed. 3. New bilateral pleural effusions and extensive increasing consolidations and infiltrates in the right lung. 4. See above regarding other findings.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT angiogram of the chest to look for blood clots in the lungs.  \n**Reason for exam:** Check for a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs).  \n**Technique:** A CT scan of the chest after injecting 100 mL of Isovue‑300 contrast.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- No blood clots were seen in the main pulmonary arteries or the large right or left arteries.  \n- The larger small arteries near the center of the lungs are clear, but the very small arteries farther out, especially on the right side, are hard to see because of lung changes that will be described later.  \n- A very large, mixed‑density mass on the right side of the chest wall measures about 10 × 12 cm (seen on slice #35).  \n- Just above that mass is a second mixed‑density tumor about 5 × 3.3 cm.  \n- Compared with the scan from 01/23/09, this second tumor has not changed much.  \n- The lungs have changed a lot: there are fluid collections (pleural effusions) on both sides—small on the right, moderate on the left—causing some collapse of lung tissue (atelectasis).  \n- There are large areas of lung consolidation (lung tissue that has filled with fluid or cells) on the right side, all new or much larger than before.  \n- A spiky area of increased density at the top of the right lung may be scar tissue, but cancer cannot be ruled out.  \n- No collapsed lung (pneumothorax).  \n- In the mediastinum (area between the lungs), a lymph node near the trachea is about 12 mm, which could be cancerous.  \n- The aorta (main artery) shows calcification and some soft plaque.  \n- The heart size is normal.  \n- No swollen lymph nodes in the left armpit.  \n- The thyroid looks normal.  \n- A small low‑density spot in the right liver is unclear; if needed, an ultrasound can check for liver cancer.  \n- The spleen, adrenal glands, upper kidneys, and visible pancreas look normal.  \n- The ribs near the chest wall mass are badly destroyed.  \n- There are signs of old injury to the right collarbone.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. A large mass on the right chest wall is confirmed again.  \n2. No central blood clot; the very small lung arteries are partly hidden by lung changes and cannot be fully evaluated.  \n3. New fluid collections on both sides and large, increasing lung consolidations on the right.  \n4. Other findings noted above."
