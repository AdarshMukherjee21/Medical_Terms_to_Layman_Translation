  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic abdominal pain and heme positive stool. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Antral gastritis. 2. Duodenal polyp. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photos and antral biopsy. ANESTHESIA: Demerol and Versed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Consent was obtained after all risks and benefits were described. The patient was brought back into the Endoscopy Suite. The aforementioned anesthesia was given. Once the patient was properly anesthetized, bite block was placed in the patient's mouth. Then, the patient was given the aforementioned anesthesia. Once he was properly anesthetized, the endoscope was placed in the patient's mouth that was brought down to the cricopharyngeus muscle into the esophagus and from the esophagus to his stomach. The air was insufflated down. The scope was passed down to the level of the antrum where there was some evidence of gastritis seen. The scope was passed into the duodenum and then duodenal sweep where there was a polyp seen. The scope was pulled back into the stomach in order to flex upon itself and straightened out. Biopsies were taken for CLO and histology of the antrum. The scope was pulled back. The junction was visualized. No other masses or lesions were seen. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. We will recommend the patient be on some type of a H2 blocker. Further recommendations to follow.",

A growth (polyp) in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum)\n\n**Procedure done:**  \nAn upper endoscopy with pictures and a small stomach tissue sample (biopsy).\n\n**Anesthesia:**  \nDemerol and Versed\n\n**What happened during the procedure:**  \nAfter explaining the risks and benefits, the patient gave consent. The patient was taken to the endoscopy room and given the anesthesia. A bite block was placed in the mouth. Once the patient was fully sedated, a flexible tube with a camera (the endoscope) was inserted through the mouth, down the throat, and into the esophagus and stomach. Air was pumped in to help see better. The scope reached the antrum, where inflammation was seen. It then went into the duodenum and a sweep of that area revealed a polyp. The scope was pulled back into the stomach to straighten it out. Tissue samples were taken from the antrum for testing for H. pylori (CLO test) and for a detailed look under a microscope (histology). The scope was withdrawn, the junction of the stomach and small intestine was checked, and no other growths or lesions were found. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n**Plan:**  \nThe patient will be advised to take an H2 blocker. Further instructions will be given later."
