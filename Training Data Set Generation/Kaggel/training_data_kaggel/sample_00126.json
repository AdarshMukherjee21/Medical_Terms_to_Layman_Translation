  "medical": "EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: Abdominal pain. COMPARISON EXAM: None. TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained. 5-mm slices were acquired after injection of 125 cc of Omnipaque IV. In addition, oral ReadiCAT was given. Reformatted sagittal and coronal images were obtained. DISCUSSION: There are numerous subcentimeter nodules seen within the lung bases. The largest measures up to 6 mm. No hiatal hernia is identified. Consider chest CT for further evaluation of the pulmonary nodules. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits. No dilated loops of bowel. There are punctate foci of air seen within the nondependent portions of the peritoneal cavity as well as the anterior subcutaneous fat. In addition, there is soft tissue stranding seen of the lower pelvis. In addition, the uterus is not identified. Correlate with history of recent surgery. There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy seen within the abdomen or pelvis. The bladder is within normal limits for technique. No acute bony abnormalities appreciated. No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. Postoperative changes seen within the pelvis without appreciable evidence for free fluid. 2. Numerous subcentimeter nodules seen within the lung bases. Consider chest CT for further characterization.",
  "layman": "EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.  \nREASON FOR EXAM: Abdominal pain.  \nCOMPARISON EXAM: None.  \n\nTECHNIQUE: The scan took many cross‑section images of the abdomen and pelvis. 5‑mm slices were taken after a 125‑cc IV injection of Omnipaque. Oral ReadiCAT was also given. Images were also made in side‑to‑side and front‑to‑back views.  \n\nDISCUSSION: Small lung nodules (less than 1 cm) are seen at the bottom of the lungs, the biggest being 6 mm. No hiatal hernia is seen. A chest CT might help look at these nodules more closely. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys look normal. The intestines are not swollen. Tiny air spots are seen in the upper part of the belly cavity and in the front under the skin. There is some soft‑tissue swelling in the lower pelvis. The uterus is not visible; this may be related to recent surgery. No free fluid or swollen lymph nodes are seen in the abdomen or pelvis. The bladder looks normal. No bone problems are seen, and there are no suspicious bone lesions.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Changes after surgery are seen in the pelvis, but no free fluid is present.  \n2. Many small lung nodules are present; a chest CT could help evaluate them further."
