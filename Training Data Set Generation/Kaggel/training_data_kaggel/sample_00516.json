  "medical": "REASON FOR EXAM: Coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic stenosis. FINDINGS: Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed of technically limited quality. The left ventricle was normal in size and dimensions with normal LV function. Ejection fraction was 50% to 55%. Concentric hypertrophy noted with interventricular septum measuring 1.6 cm, posterior wall measuring 1.2 cm. Left atrium is enlarged, measuring 4.42 cm. Right-sided chambers are normal in size and dimensions. Aortic root has normal diameter. Mitral and tricuspid valve reveals annular calcification. Fibrocalcific valve leaflets noted with adequate excursion. Similar findings noted on the aortic valve as well with significantly adequate excursion of valve leaflets. Atrial and ventricular septum are intact. Pericardium is intact without any effusion. No obvious intracardiac mass or thrombi noted. Doppler study reveals mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. Severe aortic stenosis with peak velocity of 2.76 with calculated ejection fraction 50% to 55% with severe aortic stenosis. There is also mitral stenosis. IMPRESSION: 1. Concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with left ventricular function. 2. Moderate mitral regurgitation. 3. Severe aortic stenosis, severe. RECOMMENDATIONS: Transesophageal echocardiogram is clinically warranted to assess the aortic valve area.",
  "layman": "**Reason for the exam**  \nThe patient is being evaluated before coronary artery bypass surgery and because of aortic valve narrowing.\n\n**Findings**  \nA transthoracic echo (ultrasound of the heart) was done, but the image quality was not ideal.  \n- The left ventricle (main pumping chamber) is the normal size and works normally. Its ejection fraction (the percentage of blood pumped out each beat) is 50‑55%.  \n- The walls of the left ventricle are thicker than normal: the septum (wall between the two sides of the heart) is 1.6 cm and the back wall is 1.2 cm.  \n- The left atrium (upper left chamber) is enlarged, measuring 4.42 cm.  \n- The right side of the heart is normal in size.  \n- The aortic root (the part of the aorta near the heart) is normal in size.  \n- The mitral and tricuspid valves show some calcium buildup around the rings. Their leaflets (the flaps that open and close) are thickened but still move enough.  \n- The aortic valve also has thickened, calcified leaflets that move adequately.  \n- The walls between the chambers (septum) are intact.  \n- The pericardium (the sac around the heart) is normal, with no fluid build‑up.  \n- No masses or blood clots were seen inside the heart.  \n- Doppler study shows mild‑to‑moderate leaking of the mitral valve.  \n- The aortic valve is severely narrowed, with a peak blood flow speed of 2.76 m/s and an ejection fraction still 50‑55%.  \n- There is also narrowing of the mitral valve.\n\n**Impression**  \n1. Thickened left ventricle walls with normal pumping function.  \n2. Moderate leaking of the mitral valve.  \n3. Severe narrowing of the aortic valve.\n\n**Recommendations**  \nA transesophageal echocardiogram (ultrasound from inside the esophagus) is recommended to better measure the aortic valve area."
