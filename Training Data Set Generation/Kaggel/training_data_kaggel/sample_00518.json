  "medical": "CC: Memory difficulty. HX: This 64 y/o RHM had had difficulty remembering names, phone numbers and events for 12 months prior to presentation, on 2/28/95. This had been called to his attention by the clerical staff at his parish--he was a Catholic priest. He had had no professional or social faux pas or mishaps due to his memory. He could not tell whether his problem was becoming worse, so he brought himself to the Neurology clinic on his own referral. MEDS: None. PMH: 1)appendectomy, 2)tonsillectomy, 3)childhood pneumonia, 4)allergy to sulfa drugs. FHX: Both parents experienced memory problems in their ninth decades, but not earlier. 5 siblings have had no memory trouble. There are no neurological illnesses in his family. SHX: Catholic priest. Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP131/74, HR78, RR12, 36.9C, Wt. 77kg, Ht. 178cm. MS: A&O to person, place and time. 29/30 on MMSE; 2/3 recall at 5 minutes. 2/10 word recall at 10 minutes. Unable to remember the name of the President (Clinton). 23words/60 sec on Category fluency testing (normal). Mild visual constructive deficit. The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable and there were no extrapyramidal signs or primitive reflexes noted. COURSE: TSH 5.1, T4 7.9, RPR non-reactive. Neuropsychological evaluation, 3/6/95, revealed: 1)well preserved intellectual functioning and orientation, 2) significant deficits in verbal and visual memory, proper naming, category fluency and working memory, 3)performances which were below expectations on tests of speed of reading, visual scanning, visual construction and clock drawing, 4)limited insight into the scope and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction. The findings indicated multiple areas of cerebral dysfunction. With the exception of the patient's report of minimal occupational dysfunction ( which may reflect poor insight), the clinical picture is consistent with a progressive dementia syndrome such as Alzheimer's disease. MRI brain, 3/6/95, showed mild generalized atrophy, more severe in the occipital-parietal regions. In 4/96, his performance on repeat neuropsychological evaluation was relatively stable. His verbal learning and delayed recognition were within normal limits, whereas delayed recall was &quot;moderately severely&quot; impaired. Immediate and delayed visual memory were slightly below expectations. Temporal orientation and expressive language skills were below expectation, especially in word retrieval. These findings were suggestive of particular, but not exclusive, involvement of the temporal lobes. On 9/30/96, he was evaluated for a 5 minute spell of visual loss, OU. The episode occurred on Friday, 9/27/96, in the morning while sitting at his desk doing paperwork. He suddenly felt that his gaze was pulled toward a pile of letters; then a &quot;curtain&quot; came down over both visual fields, like &quot;everything was in the shade.&quot; During the episode he felt fully alert and aware of his surroundings. He concurrently heard a &quot;grating sound&quot; in his head. After the episode, he made several phone calls, during which he reportedly sounded confused, and perseverated about opening a bank account. He then drove to visit his sister in Muscatine, Iowa, without accident. He was reportedly &quot;normal&quot; when he reached her house. He was able to perform Mass over the weekend without any difficulty. Neurologic examination, 9/30/96, was notable for: 1)category fluency score of 18items/60 sec. 2)VFFTC and EOM were intact. There was no RAPD, INO, loss of visual acuity. Glucose 178 (elevated), ESR ,Lipid profile, GS, CBC with differential, Carotid duplex scan, EKG, and EEG were all normal. MRI brain, 9/30/96, was unchanged from previous, 3/6/95. On 1/3/97, he had a 30 second spell of lightheadedness without vertigo, but with balance difficulty, after picking up a box of books. The episode was felt due to orthostatic changes. 1/8/97 neuropsychological evaluation was stable and his MMSE score was 25/30 (with deficits in visual construction, orientation, and 2/3 recall at 1 minute). Category fluency score 23 items/60 sec. Neurologic exam was notable for graphesthesia in the left hand. In 2/97, he had episodes of anxiety, marked fluctuations in job performance and resigned his pastoral position. His neurologic exam was unchanged. An FDG-PET scan on 2/14/97 revealed decreased uptake in the right posterior temporal-parietal and lateral occipital regions.",
  "layman": "Chief complaint: trouble with memory.  \n\nHistory: A 64‑year‑old Roman Catholic priest had been having difficulty remembering names, phone numbers, and events for about a year before he first saw us on February 28, 1995. His parish clerks noticed the problem. He had not made any mistakes at work or in his personal life because of the memory loss. Unsure whether it was getting worse, he decided to visit a neurology clinic on his own.  \n\nMedications: none.  \n\nPast medical history: appendectomy, tonsil removal, childhood pneumonia, allergy to sulfa drugs.  \n\nFamily history: both parents had memory problems when they were in their 90s, but not earlier. His five siblings have no memory problems. No family history of neurological disease.  \n\nSocial history: he is a Catholic priest. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.  \n\nPhysical exam: blood pressure 131/74 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, breathing 12/min, temperature 36.9 °C, weight 77 kg, height 178 cm.  \n\nMental status: alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Mini‑Mental State Exam (MMSE) score 29/30. He remembered 2 of 3 items after 5 minutes and 2 of 10 words after 10 minutes. He could not name the current president, Bill Clinton. He produced 23 words in 60 seconds on a word‑category test, which is normal. He had a mild difficulty with visual construction. The rest of the neurological exam was normal, with no abnormal movements or reflexes.  \n\nCourse: Blood tests showed TSH 5.1, T4 7.9, and a non‑reactive RPR. A neuropsychological test on March 6, 1995 found:  \n1) good overall thinking and orientation;  \n2) large problems with remembering spoken and written information, naming, word‑category fluency, and working memory;  \n3) slower performance on reading, scanning, drawing clocks, and visual construction;  \n4) he did not fully understand how much his thinking was affected.  \n\nThese results pointed to problems in several brain areas. Except for a small report of work difficulties (which may be due to lack of insight), the picture fits a progressive dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. An MRI on March 6, 1995 showed mild overall brain shrinkage, especially in the back‑top part of the brain.  \n\nIn April 1996, a repeat neuropsychological test was about the same. His spoken learning and delayed recognition were normal, but he had moderate to severe trouble recalling after a delay. Visual memory was a little below normal. He had trouble with time orientation and speaking, especially finding words. These results suggest the temporal lobes were involved, but not exclusively.  \n\nOn September 30, 1996, he was seen after a 5‑minute episode of vision loss in both eyes. The event happened on Friday, September 27, 1996, while he was at his desk. He felt his gaze pulled toward a pile of letters, then a “curtain” fell over both sides of his vision, as if everything was in shade. He was fully alert and aware during the episode and heard a grating sound in his head. Afterward he made several phone calls and seemed confused, repeating that he needed to open a bank account. He then drove to his sister’s house in Muscatine, Iowa, without any problems. He was normal when he arrived and could conduct Mass over the weekend without difficulty.  \n\nThe neurological exam on September 30, 1996 showed: 1) 18 words in 60 seconds on the word‑category test; 2) visual‑verbal fluency and eye‑movement were normal; no abnormal eye‑reflexes, no eye‑movement disorders, and no loss of vision. Blood glucose was high at 178. ESR, lipid profile, glucose, CBC, carotid ultrasound, EKG, and EEG were all normal. An MRI on September 30, 1996 was the same as the one from March 6, 1995.  \n\nOn January 3, 1997, he had a 30‑second episode of lightheadedness, no dizziness, but trouble keeping his balance after picking up a box of books. He thought it was due to standing up too quickly. A neuropsychological test on January 8, 1997 was similar to before; his MMSE was 25 out of 30, with problems in visual construction, orientation, and remembering 2 of 3 items after one minute. He produced 23 words in 60 seconds on the word‑category test. The neurological exam showed he could feel touch on the left hand.  \n\nIn February 1997, he had anxiety episodes, big swings in job performance, and he resigned from his priest job. His neurological exam was still the same.  \n\nAn FDG‑PET scan on February 14, 1997 showed reduced activity in the right back‑top part of the brain and the side of the back‑top region."
