  "medical": "CC: Left hand numbness on presentation; then developed lethargy later that day. HX: On the day of presentation, this 72 y/o RHM suddenly developed generalized weakness and lightheadedness, and could not rise from a chair. Four hours later he experienced sudden left hand numbness lasting two hours. There were no other associated symptoms except for the generalized weakness and lightheadedness. He denied vertigo. He had been experiencing falling spells without associated LOC up to several times a month for the past year. MEDS: procardia SR, Lasix, Ecotrin, KCL, Digoxin, Colace, Coumadin. PMH: 1)8/92 evaluation for presyncope (Echocardiogram showed: AV fibrosis/calcification, AV stenosis/insufficiency, MV stenosis with annular calcification and regurgitation, moderate TR, Decreased LV systolic function, severe LAE. MRI brain: focal areas of increased T2 signal in the left cerebellum and in the brainstem probably representing microvascular ischemic disease. IVG (MUGA scan)revealed: global hypokinesis of the LV and biventricular dysfunction, RV ejection Fx 45% and LV ejection Fx 39%. He was subsequently placed on coumadin severe valvular heart disease), 2)HTN, 3)Rheumatic fever and heart disease, 4)COPD, 5)ETOH abuse, 6)colonic polyps, 7)CAD, 8)CHF, 9)Appendectomy, 10)Junctional tachycardia. FHX: stroke, bone cancer, dementia. SHX: 2ppd smoker since his teens; quit 2 years ago. 6-pack beer plus 2 drinks per day for many years: now claims he has been dry for 2 years. Denies illicit drug use. EXAM: 36.8C, 90BPM, BP138/56. MS: Alert and oriented to person, place, but not date. Hypophonic and dysarthric speech. 2/3 recall. Followed commands. CN: Left homonymous hemianopia and left CN7 nerve palsy (old). MOTOR: full strength throughout. SENSORY: unremarkable. COORDINATION: dysmetric FNF and HKS movements (left worse than right). STATION: RUE pronator drift and Romberg sign present. GAIT: shuffling and bradykinetic. REFLEXES: 1+/1+ to 2+/2+ and symmetric throughout. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. HEENT: Neck supple and no carotid bruits. CV: RRR with 3/6 SEM and diastolic murmurs throughout the precordium. Lungs: bibasilar crackles. LABS: PT 19 (elevated) and PTT 46 (elevated). COURSE: Coumadin was discontinued on admission as he was felt to have suffered a right hemispheric stroke. The initial HCT revealed a subtle low density area in the right occipital lobe and no evidence of hemorrhage. He was scheduled to undergo an MRI Brain scan the same day, and shortly before the procedure became lethargic. By the time the scan was complete he was stuporous. MRI Scan then revealed a hypointense area of T1 signal in the right temporal lobe with a small foci of hyperintensity within it. The hyperintense area seen on T1 weighted images appeared hypointense on T2 weighted images. There was edema surrounding the lesion The findings were consistent with a hematoma. A CT scan performed 4 hours later confirmed a large hematoma with surrounding edema involving the right temporal/parietal/occipital lobes. The patient subsequently died.",
  "layman": "**Chief complaint:**  \nThe patient first felt numbness in his left hand. Later that day he became very sleepy.\n\n**History of present illness:**  \nA 72‑year‑old man came to the hospital after suddenly feeling very weak all over and light‑headed. He could not get up from a chair. About four hours later he had numbness in his left hand that lasted two hours. No other symptoms were reported except the weakness and light‑headedness. He said he had not felt dizzy. He has had episodes of falling without losing consciousness several times a month for the past year.\n\n**Medications:**  \nProcardia SR, Lasix, Ecotrin, potassium chloride, Digoxin, Colace, Coumadin.\n\n**Past medical history:**  \n1. In August 1992 he was evaluated for fainting. An echocardiogram showed heart valve scarring and narrowing, a leaking mitral valve, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, weak left‑ventricle pumping, and a very enlarged left atrium. An MRI of the brain showed small areas of possible old damage in the left cerebellum and brainstem. A MUGA scan showed the left ventricle and both ventricles were weak, with right‑ventricle ejection fraction 45% and left‑ventricle ejection fraction 39%. He was started on Coumadin for severe valve disease.  \n2. Hypertension  \n3. Rheumatic fever and heart disease  \n4. COPD  \n5. Alcohol abuse  \n6. Colonic polyps  \n7. Coronary artery disease  \n8. Congestive heart failure  \n9. Appendectomy  \n10. Junctional tachycardia\n\n**Family history:** Stroke, bone cancer, dementia.  \n\n**Social history:** Smoked two packs a day since his teens, quit two years ago. Drank six beers and two drinks a day for many years, now says he has been sober for two years. No drug use.\n\n**Physical exam:**  \nTemperature 36.8 °C, pulse 90 bpm, blood pressure 138/56 mm Hg.  \nHe was alert and knew who he was and where he was, but did not know the date. Speech was soft and slurred. He remembered two out of three words and could follow simple commands.  \n- Vision: He could not see the left side of his visual field.  \n- Facial nerve: He had a left facial weakness that had happened before.  \n- Muscles: Strength was normal in all limbs.  \n- Sensation: Normal.  \n- Coordination: His finger‑to‑nose and heel‑to‑shin movements were off‑target, worse on the left.  \n- Balance: His right arm drifted when he tried to hold it straight, and he could not stand with his eyes closed (Romberg sign).  \n- Gait: He walked slowly and shuffling.  \n- Reflexes: Normal and symmetrical.  \n- Plantar responses: Normal.  \n- Neck: Soft, no carotid bruits.  \n- Heart: Regular rhythm, a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur and a diastolic murmur heard all over the chest.  \n- Lungs: Crackles at the bases.\n\n**Labs:**  \nProthrombin time 19 s (high), partial thromboplastin time 46 s (high).\n\n**Course:**  \nWhen he was admitted, the doctors stopped Coumadin because they thought he had a right‑brain stroke. A head CT showed a small low‑density area in the right occipital lobe but no bleeding. An MRI of the brain was scheduled the same day. Before the scan, he became sleepy. By the time the MRI finished, he was very drowsy. The MRI showed a dark spot on T1 images in the right temporal lobe with a small bright spot inside it. The bright spot looked dark on T2 images. There was swelling around the lesion, indicating a bleed. A CT scan four hours later confirmed a large bleed with swelling in the right temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The patient died."
