  "medical": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Direct right inguinal hernia. TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Marlex repair of right inguinal hernia. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the table in the supine position, and given a spinal anesthetic. The right inguinal region was shaved and prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. The patient received 1 gm of Ancef IV push. Transverse incision was made in the intraabdominal crease and carried through skin and subcutaneous tissue. The external oblique fascia was exposed and incised down to and through the external inguinal ring. The spermatic cord and hernia sac were dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal. The cord was surrounded with a Penrose drain. The hernia sac was separated from the cord structures. The floor of the inguinal canal, which consisted of attenuated transversalis fascia, was imbricated upon itself with a running locked suture of 2-0 Prolene. Marlex patch 1 x 4 in dimension was trimmed to an appropriate shape with a defect to accommodate the cord. It was placed around the cord and sutured to itself with 2-0 Prolene. The patch was then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to Cooper's ligament and inguinal ligaments, and superiorly to conjoined tendon using 2-0 Prolene. The area was irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to provide prolonged postoperative pain relief. The cord was returned to its position. External oblique fascia was closed with a running 2-0 PDS, subcu with 2-0 Vicryl, and skin with running subdermal 4-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips. Sponge and needle counts were correct. Sterile dressing was applied.",

The right groin area was shaved, cleaned, and covered with sterile drapes. The patient received a 1‑gram dose of the antibiotic Ancef by IV push. A horizontal cut was made in the natural crease of the abdomen, going through the skin and fat. The outer layer of the abdominal wall (external oblique fascia) was exposed and cut through to the external inguinal ring. The spermatic cord and the hernia sac were gently separated from the underside of the fascia, exposing the thin floor of the inguinal canal. A Penrose drain was placed around the cord. The hernia sac was then separated from the cord structures. The thin floor of the canal, made of weakened transversalis fascia, was stitched to itself with a running locked stitch of 2‑0 Prolene. A Marlex mesh patch measuring 1 × 4 inches was trimmed to fit and left a small opening for the cord. The patch was wrapped around the cord and stitched to itself with 2‑0 Prolene. The patch was then anchored medially to the pubic tubercle, below to Cooper’s ligament and the inguinal ligaments, and above to the conjoined tendon, all with 2‑0 Prolene. The area was washed with saline, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to help control pain after surgery. The cord was put back in place. The outer fascia was closed with a running 2‑0 PDS stitch, the subcutaneous tissue with 2‑0 Vicryl, and the skin with a running subdermal 4‑0 Vicryl plus Steri‑Strips. Sponge and needle counts were correct. A sterile dressing was applied."
