  "medical": "EXAM: CT abdomen without contrast and pelvis without contrast, reconstruction. REASON FOR EXAM: Right lower quadrant pain, rule out appendicitis. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis. An intravenous line could not be obtained for the use of intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: The appendix is normal. There is a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon. There is no evidence of a small bowel obstruction or evidence of pericolonic inflammatory process. Examination of the extreme lung bases appear clear, no pleural effusions. The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas appear normal given the lack of contrast. There is a small hiatal hernia. There is no intrarenal stone or evidence of obstruction bilaterally. There is a questionable vague region of low density in the left anterior mid pole region, this may indicate a tiny cyst, but it is not well seen given the lack of contrast. This can be correlated with a followup ultrasound if necessary. The gallbladder has been resected. There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy. There is abdominal atherosclerosis without evidence of an aneurysm. Dedicated scans of the pelvis disclosed phleboliths, but no free fluid or adenopathy. There are surgical clips present. There is a tiny airdrop within the bladder. If this patient has not had a recent catheterization, correlate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection. IMPRESSION: 1.Normal appendix. 2.Moderate stool throughout the colon. 3.No intrarenal stones. 4.Tiny airdrop within the bladder. If this patient has not had a recent catheterization, correlate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection. The report was faxed upon dictation.",
  "layman": "**Exam:** CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.  \n**Reason for exam:** Pain in the lower right side of the belly; doctors want to check for appendicitis.  \n**Technique:** The scan was done without using contrast dye because a vein could not be accessed.  \n\n**Findings:**  \n- The appendix looks normal.  \n- There is a moderate amount of stool in the colon.  \n- No signs of a blockage in the small intestine or inflammation around the colon.  \n- The lower parts of the lungs look clear; no fluid around the lungs.  \n- The parts of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas that were seen look normal, but we can’t see them well without contrast.  \n- A small hiatal hernia is present.  \n- No kidney stones or blockages in the kidneys.  \n- There is a faint, unclear spot in the front‑middle part of the left kidney that might be a tiny cyst; it isn’t clear because of no contrast. An ultrasound later could help.  \n- The gallbladder has been removed.  \n- No free fluid or abnormal lymph nodes in the abdomen.  \n- There is some atherosclerosis (hardening) in the abdominal arteries, but no aneurysm.  \n- Pelvic scans show small blood clots in veins (phleboliths) but no fluid or lymph node problems.  \n- Surgical clips are present.  \n- A tiny air bubble is seen in the bladder. If the patient hasn’t had a recent catheter, check for signs of a urinary tract infection.  \n\n**Impression:**  \n1. Normal appendix.  \n2. Moderate stool in the colon.  \n3. No kidney stones.  \n4. Tiny air bubble in the bladder – check for urinary infection if no recent catheter.  \n\nThe report was faxed when it was written."
