  "medical": "The patient was evaluated today in follow up evaluation. She continues to suffer from ongoing neck and lower back pain with no recent radicular complaints. Her evaluation today reveals restriction in the range of motion of the cervical and lumbar region with tenderness and spasms of the paraspinal musculature. Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical. Palpable trigger points were noted bilaterally in the trapezius and lumbar paraspinal musculature bilaterally. Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation. She is suffering from ongoing myofascitis. Her treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections, which were performed today. She tolerated the procedure well. I have asked her to ice the region intermittently for 15 minutes off and on x 3. She will be followed in four weeks' time for repeat trigger point injections if indicated.",
  "layman": "The patient was seen today for a follow‑up visit. She still has neck and lower back pain, but she has not had any new nerve‑related symptoms. During the exam her neck and lower back were stiff, and the muscles next to her spine were tender and tight. Her muscle strength was normal (5/5) and her reflexes were normal and even. The doctor found tender spots (trigger points) in her shoulder blades and lower back muscles on both sides. She has ongoing muscle inflammation (myofascitis). The plan is to give a series of trigger‑point injections, which were done today. She tolerated the injections well. The doctor told her to apply ice to the painful areas for 15 minutes at a time, three times a day. She will return in four weeks for another check‑up and more injections if needed."
