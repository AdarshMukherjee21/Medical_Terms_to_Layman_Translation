  "medical": "TESTICULAR ULTRASOUND REASON FOR EXAM: Left testicular swelling for one day. FINDINGS: The left testicle is normal in size and attenuation, it measures 3.2 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm. The right epididymis measures up to 9 mm. There is a hydrocele on the right side. Normal flow is seen within the testicle and epididymis on the right. The left testicle is normal in size and attenuation, it measures 3.9 x 2.1 x 2.6 cm. The left testicle shows normal blood flow. The left epididymis measures up to 9 mm and shows a markedly increased vascular flow. There is mild scrotal wall thickening. A hydrocele is seen on the left side. IMPRESSION: 1. Hypervascularity of the left epididymis compatible with left epididymitis. 2. Bilateral hydroceles.",
  "layman": "**Testicular Ultrasound**\n\n**Reason for exam:** Swelling in the left testicle that started a day ago.\n\n**Findings:**  \n- The left testicle looks normal in size and texture, measuring about 3.2 × 1.7 × 2.3 cm.  \n- The right epididymis (the tube behind the testicle) is about 9 mm long.  \n- There is a small fluid collection (hydrocele) on the right side.  \n- Blood flow in the right testicle and epididymis is normal.  \n\n- The left testicle is also normal in size and texture, measuring about 3.9 × 2.1 × 2.6 cm.  \n- Blood flow in the left testicle is normal.  \n- The left epididymis is about 9 mm long and shows a lot of blood flow.  \n- The scrotal wall is a little thicker than usual.  \n- A small fluid collection (hydrocele) is also present on the left side.\n\n**Impression:**  \n1. The left epididymis has increased blood flow, which is typical for left epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis).  \n2. Fluid collections (hydroceles) are present on both sides."
