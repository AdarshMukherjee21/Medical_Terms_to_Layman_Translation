  "medical": "A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a retinal break allows vitreous fluid to separate the neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium, often presenting with photopsia or a peripheral visual field defect.",
  "layman": "A retinal detachment happens when a tear in the retina lets fluid pull the retina away from the back of the eye, causing flashes of light or a curtain‑like shadow in the vision."
